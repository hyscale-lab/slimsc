Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. It's about how the number of stars varies with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance somehow.

The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Right, the formula I remember is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 over distance (in light-years) divided by something, but more accurately, parallax (plx) equals 1 divided by distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, then maybe I can express N in terms of d. Since d is 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. Plugging that into the equation: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me calculate that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, so it's probably about the density or the rate of change. I think it's about the differential number of stars per unit distance. So maybe dN/dr is what we're looking for.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars varies as N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how N changes with distance, in terms of per unit distance. So perhaps the rate at which stars appear as you move a small distance dr is given by the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, but maybe it's simpler. The number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance r with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell times the volume element. Wait, no, maybe not. Because the number of stars depends on the volume, but the question is about the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I should model it in terms of density. Alternatively, maybe the number of stars within a certain distance is proportional to d^5. For example, if you have a volume, the number of stars might be proportional to that volume, but in this case, it's a different relationship.

Wait,
