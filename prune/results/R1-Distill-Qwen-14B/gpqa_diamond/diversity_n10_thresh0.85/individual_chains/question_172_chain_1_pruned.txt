Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is the visible part of the star, and LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy states. Right, the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). So if E_i is higher than E_j, the exponent becomes negative and the ratio decreases.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call that ΔE = E_i - E_j. Since star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2 in the same energy level, the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1/2, maybe? Or wait, actually, star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So if star_2 has x atoms in a certain state, star_1 has 2x.

Wait, wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that in star_2. So the ratio (n_i/n_j) for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1/2? Or perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, in each star, the same energy levels apply. So for both stars, the same ΔE is considered. So for star_1: n1_i /n1_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: n2_i /n2_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But the problem says that n1_i is twice as much as n2_i? Or wait, the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2". So perhaps n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

But wait, no. Let me
