Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And it's asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are four different r values, each a triplet of numbers.

Wait, what do I remember about density matrices? I think the density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, but here it's a mixed state because it's a sum of two projectors multiplied by 1/2. So ρ is a mixed state.

The density matrix for a qubit can be represented in terms of the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Each qubit state is a point on the surface of a unit sphere (for pure states) or inside it (for mixed states).

So, how do I find the Bloch vector for a given density matrix? The general form for a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (rx, ry, rz). Wait, but in this case, our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that.

|0> is [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2. So ρ is (I/2).

Comparing this to the general form, (I + r·σ)/2, I can set them equal. So I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2, which implies that r·σ must be zero. So the vector r must be (0,0,0), because if r is zero, then r·σ is zero matrix.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices σ are [σx, σy, σz], each 2x2 matrices. The dot product r·σ would be rx σx + ry σy + rz σz. So if that's zero, rx, ry, rz must all be zero. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer.

Alternatively, thinking about what this state represents. The density matrix ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. This is a completely mixed state, which in the Bloch sphere corresponds to the center point, the origin. Because a mixed state with equal probability of being in 0 or 1, and no coherence, so no direction in the Bloch sphere. So it's at the center.

So the correct option is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) with equal probabilities. The density matrix can also be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is evident that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that the Bloch vector \(r\) must satisfy \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Since the state is completely mixed with no coherence and equal probabilities for \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), it is located at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin \((0, 0, 0)\).

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is:
