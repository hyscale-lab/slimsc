Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I think I should draw the structures of both the starting material and the target to visualize what's going on. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is like a triple bond, so maybe it's CH2-C≡CH attached to the ring. Wait, no, ethynyl is the substituent. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH2 group? Or is it a substituent like cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group? Wait, no, ethynyl is the group. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached. So the structure is probably cyclohexane attached to a triple bond, like CH2-C≡C-CH2- attached to a cyclohexane? No, wait, ethynyl is a substituent where the triple bond is directly attached to the ring. So it's cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. Oh wait, no, ethynyl is the group where the triple bond is between two carbons, with one attached to the ring. So maybe it's more like cyclohexane attached to a -C≡C-CH3 group? Or is it a substituent like -C≡CH?

Wait, I think I should clarify. Ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is a substituent where the triple bond is between the carbon attached to the ring and another carbon. So maybe the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group, like:

Cyclohexane ring—C≡CH.

So the starting material is cyclohexane attached to an ethynyl group, which is a triple bond with a hydrogen. So the
