Okay, let's try to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so we've got a wave function given, and we need to find the normalization constant 'a'. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Oh wait, so this wave function must be zero outside that region, but since the question states that when measuring, none are found outside, that probably means the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. 

Wait, no, actually, the wave function as given is valid in the region where the particles exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the part outside is zero. But in this case, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, wait, but the square root of (1+x) would require that 1+x is positive, so x >= -1. But maybe that's not the main issue here.

The key point is that the wave function should be normalized. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability must be 1.

The wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex part is included. To compute the normalization, I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1.

First, let's compute |ψ(x)|². The absolute square of a complex number is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So for ψ(x), the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. 

Wait, yes, because (a/sqrt(1+x) )^2 is a²/(1+x), and (-0.5i)^2 would be (0.25)(i²), but i² is -1. Wait, no, actually, when you square the imaginary part, it's (0.5i)^2 = (0.25)(i^2) = -0.25. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you compute |ψ(x)|², you don't square ψ(x), you compute ψ*(x) * ψ(x). Let me think again.

So ψ(x) = A + B i, where A is real (a/sqrt(1+x)), and B is imaginary (-0.5). So ψ*(x) is A - B i. Then ψ*(x) ψ(x) is (A - B i)(A + B i) = A² + B². Because the cross terms cancel out. So yes, |ψ(x)|² is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [(a²)/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me set that up as an equation:

∫[1 to 3] [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts:

a² ∫[1 to3] 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫[1 to3] dx = 1.

Let's compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first term is a² ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to3 is (3-1) = 2. So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute ln(2) approximately. I know ln(2) is about 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is the square root of 0.7213. Let's calculate that.

√0.7213 ≈ 0.849. So approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of "a", we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability is 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1
