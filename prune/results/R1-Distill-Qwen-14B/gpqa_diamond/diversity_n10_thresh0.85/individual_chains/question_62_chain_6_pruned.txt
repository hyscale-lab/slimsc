Okay, let's tackle this synthesis problem. Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me draw that structure mentally. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which means a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, and that methyl has an OH group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl and hydroxy on the same methyl group? No, wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which would be a methyl group connected to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH. Wait, but that's impossible because a methyl can only have three bonds. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 group, which also has an OH. So, the substituent is -(CH2-cyclohexyl)-OH? No, wait, maybe it's a cyclohexyl-substituted methyl group with an OH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyl-like group but with cyclohexane. Let me think. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde is at position 1 of cyclohexane. Attached to that same carbon (position 1) is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, the substituent is a methyl group that's attached to both a cyclohexane ring and an OH group. So, the structure would be cyclohexane with an aldehyde at C1 and a CH2-OH group, but that CH2 is attached to a cyclohexane ring as well. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (cyclohexylmethyl) group that also has an OH. So, like a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which is in turn attached to the cyclohexane's C1. Oh, I think I got it. So, the structure is cyclohexane with an aldehyde at C1 and a -(CH2-cyclohexyl) group that also has an OH on the same CH2.
