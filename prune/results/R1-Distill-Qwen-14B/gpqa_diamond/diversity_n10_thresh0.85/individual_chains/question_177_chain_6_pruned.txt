Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same for both. Also, their radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but in this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh right, that's about blackbody radiation. The peak wavelength λ_max is related to the temperature by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T were different, λ_max would change. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait! Radial velocities are given. How does that fit in? Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Oh, but for the purpose of determining the luminosity, which depends on temperature, how does that come into play?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law. But the peak wavelengths are the same, so T1 = T2. But wait, the radial velocities are given, but how would that affect the observed temperature or luminosity?

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh! Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelengths could be shifted. So the observed wavelength would be different from the emitted one. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (the λ_max) are the same. So perhaps the rest wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same.

Wait, let's think. The star's actual emission peak is at λ_emit, but due to Doppler shift, we observe λ_observed. So, for Star_1, which has radial velocity 0, its observed λ_max is λ1. For Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, its observed λ_max is λ2. The question says λ1 = λ2.

So, the Doppler shift equation comes into play here. The Doppler effect for light is given by λ_observed / λ_emitted = sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ), but wait, actually, I think I might have the formula backwards. Alternatively, it's λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) for a source moving away. Wait, no, if the source is moving away (positive v_r), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ). Hmm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + β) / (1 - β) ), where β is v/c. But wait, that's when the source is moving away. Wait, no, wait. If the source is moving towards the observer with velocity v, then the observed wavelength is shorter (blue shift). So the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( [1 - β] / [1 + β]
