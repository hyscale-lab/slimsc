Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ which is equal to (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but this one looks like a mixture.

Wait, so the given ρ is a 2x2 matrix, right? Because it's acting on a qubit. Let's write it out. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 at (2,2). So when we add these two, the diagonal elements become 1 each, and off-diagonal are zeros. Then we multiply by 1/2, so the diagonals are 1/2 each.

So the matrix ρ is:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of Bloch vector coordinates. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x,y,z). The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The density matrix can be written as (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. So when we expand this, ρ would have elements based on these. Let me think about the diagonal and off-diagonal terms.

So for ρ as given, the diagonal elements are 1/2 each. The off-diagonal are zero. Let me compare that to the general form. The general form when expanded:

Since σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when we compute (I + r·σ)/2, each term contributes.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So adding r_x σx gives [[1, r_x],[r_x, 1]] when multiplied by 1/2 (since (I + ...)/2). Similarly for the other terms. Wait, let me compute each part more carefully.

Wait, the full expression is (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. Let's compute each matrix:

I is [[1,0],[0,1]]
r_x σx is [[0, r_x],[r_x, 0]]
r_y σy is [[0, -i r_y],[i r_y, 0]]
r_z σz is [[r_z, 0],[0, -r_z]]

Adding them all together and then dividing by 2.

So the combined matrix is:

(1/2) * [
[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
[r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]
]

So the diagonal elements are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. The off-diagonal elements are (r_x - i r_y)/2 and (r_x + i r_y)/2.

Now, comparing this to the given ρ matrix which is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. Let's see what this implies for the components of r.

Looking at the diagonal elements: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. So 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, the other diagonal element: (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2. Which also gives r_z =0, which is consistent.

Now, the off-diagonal elements are (r_x - i r_y)/2. But in our given ρ, the off-diagonal elements are zero. So (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. So r_x = 0 and r_y=0.

So the Bloch vector r has components (0,0,0). Because r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0.

So the geometrical position in qubit space is the origin. So looking at the options:

Option C is r=(0,0,0), which is the origin. Option B is (0,0,1), which would imply r_z=1, but we have r_z=0. So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{2} 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the general form of \( \rho \) is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ 
r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), the diagonal elements are \( \frac{1}{2} \), which implies:

\[
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1 - r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

From these, \( r_z = 0 \). The off-diagonal elements are \( 0 \), which implies:

\[
\frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad r_y = 0.
\]

Thus, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin in qubit space.

Analyzing the options:
- **A)** \( (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as \( r_x \) and \( r_y \) are not 1.
- **B)** \( (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as \( r_z \) is 0.
- **C)** \( (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as derived above.
- **D)** \( (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as all components are nonzero.

The correct answer is **C**, \( (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
