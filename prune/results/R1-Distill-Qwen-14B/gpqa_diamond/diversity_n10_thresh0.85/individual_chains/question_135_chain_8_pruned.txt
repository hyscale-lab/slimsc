Okay, so I'm trying to solve this particle physics question. Hmm, let me read it again. The problem is about the decay modes of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

So, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. Yukawa couplings usually describe the interaction between bosons and fermions. The structure here looks like a Yukawa coupling term where the boson X interacts with some fermion ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Decay modes depend on the available energy and the possible fermion pairs that the boson can decay into. For a decay to be allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of X.

First, I need to figure out which fermions ψ_f are involved. The Lagrangian term has ψ_f, which probably represents different types of fermions. The fermions could be quarks or leptons.

In Yukawa theory, the mass term comes from the vacuum expectation value (vev) υ. When the vev is non-zero, the interaction term becomes a mass term for the fermions. So, the fermions ψ_f would acquire a mass proportional to λ f υ. Wait, but the mass of the fermion would be m_f = λ f υ /√2, something like that. I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula, but the idea is that the fermion mass is proportional to the coupling λ and the vev υ.

But in this problem, the question is about the decay of X. For X to decay into fermions f and f̄, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion would have energy m_f, so the total would be 2 m_f. So X's mass (6 GeV) must be greater than or equal to 2 m_f.

So the fermions that X can decay into must have m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of all the known fermions? Let me think:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
