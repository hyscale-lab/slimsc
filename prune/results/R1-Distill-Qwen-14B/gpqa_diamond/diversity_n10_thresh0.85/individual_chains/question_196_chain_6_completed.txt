Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, relativistic, so that means I can't just use the classical equations of motion. I remember that in relativity, the equations get modified because of the speed limits and energy considerations.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. But wait, because it's relativistic, I think the force law might be different. Oh wait, no, Hooke's law is the same, but the equations of motion would change because of relativistic effects on mass or energy.

Wait, in the relativistic case, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator isn't the simple harmonic oscillator equation. I think the relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator leads to a more complex differential equation. Let me think. The force is F = -kx, and in relativity, F is d(momentum)/dt. Momentum isn't just mv; it's gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the equation of motion would involve the derivative of gamma*m*v with respect to time. Let me write that down. F = d/dt (gamma*m*v). Since F = -kx, we have:

d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But x is the position, which as a function of time, in the oscillator, I know that in the classical case, x(t) = A cos(ω t), where ω is the angular frequency. But in the relativistic case, the frequency might change. Hmm, this seems complicated.

Wait, maybe there's a better approach. The question is about the maximum speed. So when the oscillator is at the maximum displacement, x = A, the velocity is zero, and as it moves towards equilibrium, it gains speed. The maximum speed occurs when it passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), but wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the speed is maximum at x=0. Oh wait, but in reality, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But in the relativistic scenario, energy isn't just kinetic energy as in classical mechanics.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of energy. The total energy in the relativistic oscillator should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, plus the potential energy from the spring.

Wait, the potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kx². But in the relativistic case, energy considerations might differ. Or, perhaps in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized differently, but the question is about the maximum speed, so perhaps it's about the point where all the potential energy is converted into kinetic.

Wait, but in a quantum harmonic oscillator, the ground state has zero-point energy, but this is a classical problem. So, in the classical relativistic case, the total mechanical energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) and the maximum potential energy (1/2 k A²), right? Because at maximum displacement x=A, the potential is (1/2)kA² and kinetic is zero. So the total energy E is mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So, the kinetic energy would be E - mc² = (1/2)kA². Wait, but wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So I have:

Kinetic energy at x=0: (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Hmm, because E_kinetic = (gamma -1) mc².

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if gamma is known, I can solve for v.

So, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, α. So gamma = 1 + α.

Wait, but that might not be the correct way to approach it. Let me think again.

Wait, the total mechanical energy in the oscillator is E = (1/2) k A². But in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2) k A².

At x=0, the kinetic energy is E_total - mc² = (1/2) k A². So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc² = 1/2 k A².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, wait, when x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So, the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA². So kinetic energy is (gamma m c²) - mc² = (gamma -1) mc². So:

(gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

That makes sense. So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, is that correct? Because in the non-relativistic case, when k A²/(2m) is small compared to c², then gamma would be approximately 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is close to 1, matching the classical result. So, perhaps that's the right approach.

Now, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So, let me write:

1/(sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as beta for simplicity.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + beta.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + beta)^2.

Take reciprocal of both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + beta)^2.

So, v²/c² = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2 beta + beta² - 1 ) = 2 beta + beta².

So,

v²/c² = (2 beta + beta²) / (1 + beta)^2.

But beta is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so beta = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Substituting back:

v²/c² = [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ] / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²})^2.

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c²).

So numerator becomes:

(k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c^2) ) ] squared.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out (k A²/(2 m c²)) from numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to factor the numerator:

= [ (k A²)/(m c²) ) ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ) ]

Because the numerator is (k A²/(m c²)) [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Wait, let me see:

(k A²)/(m c²) = 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = 2 beta.

So numerator:

= 2 beta + beta² = beta (2 + beta).

Denominator: (1 + beta)^2.

So:

v²/c² = [beta (2 + beta)] / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm, but beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, let me substitute beta:

v²/c² = [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2.

Let me factor out 2 from the second term in the numerator:

= [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) (2[1 + (k A^2/(4 m c^2)) ]) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )^2.

Wait, perhaps another approach would be better. Let me just compute the numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator:

[ (beta (2 + beta) ) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Let me write it as [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta +1)^2.

Hmm, perhaps this simplifies further. Let me see:

= [ beta (beta +2) ] / (beta +1)^2.

Hmm, I don't see an immediate simplification. Maybe I should just proceed to take the square root.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( [ beta (beta +2) ] / (beta +1)^2 ).

Which can be written as v_max = c * sqrt( beta (beta +2) ) / (beta +1).

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

sqrt( beta (beta + 2) ) / (beta +1) = sqrt( [ beta^2 + 2 beta ] ) / (beta +1).

Wait, beta^2 + 2 beta = beta (beta + 2) = beta^2 + 2 beta = (beta +1)^2 -1.

Because (beta +1)^2 = beta^2 + 2 beta +1.

So, beta^2 +2 beta = (beta +1)^2 -1.

So substituting back:

sqrt( (beta +1)^2 -1 ) / (beta +1) = sqrt( (beta +1)^2 -1 ) / (beta +1 ).

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this as:

sqrt( (beta +1)^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (beta +1 -1)(beta +1 +1) ) ) = sqrt( beta (beta +2) ), which brings us back.

I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ beta (beta + 2) ] ) / (beta +1).

Wait, but beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, let me compute the expression under the square root for v_max/c.

So, let me compute [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta +1)^2.

= [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta^2 + 2 beta +1 ).

Let me expand the numerator as beta^2 + 2 beta.

So, numerator: beta² + 2 beta.

Denominator: beta² + 2 beta +1.

So, the fraction is (beta² + 2 beta) / (beta² + 2 beta +1) = [ (beta (beta +2 )) ] / [ (beta +1 )^2 ].

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B is v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, let me compute 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

Wait, in our equation, we had gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ). So, 1/(gamma) = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

Wait, but looking at option B:

sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is sqrt( [ (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) + 1 ] / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is sqrt( (2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, that doesn't look like what we have.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the expression I have for v_max in terms of gamma.

We have gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ).

So, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )).

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So, v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ].

Which is [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ) -1 = 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2.

Simplify:

= (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So, v_max = sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) * c.

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) from numerator and denominator.

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as beta again.

So, numerator becomes 2 beta + beta^2.

Denominator is (1 + beta)^2.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) ) / (1 + beta).

Hmm, perhaps factor beta from numerator:

= c * sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta ).

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Looking back at the options, let me see which one matches.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2m) )) )

Wait, no, option A's denominator is 1 - (kA^2)/(2m) ), but our denominator in the expression for gamma is 1 - v²/c², which is 1/(gamma squared).

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me compute each option.

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A^2 / m )

That's the non-relativistic result. But in relativity, we can't have v_max exceeding c, so option C would give v_max that could be larger than c if k A^2/m is large. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ))

Hmm, that's a possibility. Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + beta^2), where beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, but our expression for v_max is c * sqrt( (beta (beta+2 )) ) / (beta +1 )

Hmm, not sure.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Which is sqrt( [ (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) +1 ] / (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

= sqrt( (2 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) / (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Hmm, not matching what I have.

Option D: sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Wait, if I compute 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2, where beta is (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )).

So, 1 - 1/(1+beta)^2 = [ (1+beta)^2 -1 ] / (1+beta)^2.

Which is (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ) / (1+beta)^2 = (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1+beta)^2.

Which is the same as the numerator and denominator I have for v_max/c squared.

So, v_max^2/c^2 = (2 beta + beta^2)/(1+beta)^2.

Which is exactly what I had earlier.

So, v_max = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) ) / (1 + beta )

But, 2 beta + beta^2 = beta (beta + 2 ) = (beta +1 )^2 - 1.

Wait, but looking at option D: sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which is sqrt( [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 -1 ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ] )

Which is sqrt( [2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] / (1 + ... )^2 )

Which is sqrt( (k A^2/m c^2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) / (1 + ... )^2 )

Hmm, so that's the same as my expression.

Wait, because 2 beta + beta^2 is (k A^2/(m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So, in option D, the expression inside the sqrt is (1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 ), which is ( (1 + beta )^2 -1 )/(1 + beta )^2.

Which is (2 beta + beta^2 )/(1 + beta )^2.

So, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is exactly what I have.

So, option D is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check.

In option D, the expression is:

sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ] )

Which is sqrt( [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 -1 ] / (1 + ... )^2 )

Which is sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

So yes, it's correct.

So the answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Considerations**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{kinetic}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the kinetic energy to the potential energy:
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we solve for \( v \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
   \]
   Taking the reciprocal:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]

3. **Simplifying the Expression**:  
   The above equation matches the form given in **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The denominator involves \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m} \), which does not match the derived expression.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The denominator involves \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), which is inconsistent with the derived expression.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for the speed limit \( c \).
- **Option D**: Correct. Matches the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Answer: D}}
\]
