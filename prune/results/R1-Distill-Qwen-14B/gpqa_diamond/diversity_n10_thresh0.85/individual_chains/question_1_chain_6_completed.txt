Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, perhaps the condition is that the energy difference should be much larger than the sum of the uncertainties in each state. So that the two energy levels are well separated.

But perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty for each state, and then the energy difference must be larger than the sum of these uncertainties. Wait, but if the two states have different uncertainties, which one is more significant?

Wait, let's compute the uncertainties.

First, remember that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But I also know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So perhaps I can convert ħ into eV·s.

Let me calculate ħ in eV·s. So:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So,

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, for state 1, ΔE1 = ħ / (2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-7 / 2 ≈ 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me do the math more carefully.

6.582e-16 / (2 * 1e-9) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2 * 1e9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV.

For state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2 * 1e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, no: 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 eV? Wait, let me compute exponents correctly.

Wait, 2e-8 is 2 * 1e-8. So 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) = (6.582 / 2) * (1e-16 / 1e-8) ) = 3.291 * 1e-8 eV. Oh, that's 3.291e-8 eV. So about 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

So the question is, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps. Or maybe the larger uncertainty.

Wait, but if the energy difference is much larger than either of the individual uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. Because the lines won't overlap.

So the energy difference must be significantly larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but which one is larger? ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, which is 0.329e-6 eV, whereas ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV, which is 0.0329e-6.

So ΔE1 is bigger. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be much larger than 3.29e-7 eV. Or perhaps considering sum, but wait, if the uncertainty for E1 is bigger, then that's the dominant factor.

So the energy difference should be larger than, say, 3.29e-7 eV. Because if the difference is smaller than that, the peaks might overlap.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV. That's much smaller than 3.29e-7 eV.

Option B) 1e-11 → 0.00001e-6. Also way smaller.

Option C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 3e-7 eV. So that's much larger.

Option D) 1e-8 → 0.00001e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 0.01e-7 eV, which is about a third of 3.29e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is about 0.03e-7, which is about 3e-8, which is about the same as ΔE2. But since ΔE1 is 3e-7, which is 30 times larger than D's 1e-8.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express the numbers:

ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV → 0.329e-6 eV.

ΔE2 = 3.29e-8 eV → 0.0329e-6 eV.

So for the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 to be resolvable, it must be larger than, say, the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the lines could overlap.

Wait, but in reality, the natural linewidth is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ). So if the lifetime is longer, the uncertainty is smaller, and vice versa.

In this case, E1 has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) compared to E2 (1e-8 s). So ΔE1 is larger than ΔE2.

So to resolve the two states, the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the larger uncertainty, you can't distinguish them.

Alternatively, I think the rule is that the energy difference should be much larger than the uncertainties in each of the states. So the energy difference should be much larger than ΔE1 and much larger than ΔE2.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than both uncertainties. Because 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 3.29e-7.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. Let's see: 1e-8 is 0.0329e-6, same as ΔE2. So it's about the same as ΔE2 but smaller than ΔE1, which is 0.329e-6.

So if the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is about the same as the uncertainty of E2, but way smaller than ΔE1. So that's not enough, because the uncertainty for E1 is larger. So the energy difference would be smaller than ΔE1, leading to overlap.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about this again. The uncertainty in E1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and the energy difference is 1e-8 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.03e-7 eV, which is about 3% of ΔE1. So the energy difference is much smaller than the uncertainty of E1. So you wouldn't be able to distinguish E1 and E2 if their energy difference is just 1e-8 eV.

So the correct energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, i.e., larger than 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.29e-7 eV. That's a big enough difference.

No other options are that large. Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.03 times ΔE2, which is smaller than ΔE1.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait. Why can't the energy difference be the same as the uncertainty? Because the uncertainty is the minimum precision you can have. If the difference is equal to the uncertainty, you might not be able to distinguish. So it must be significantly larger than the maximum uncertainty.

So the only option that's much larger than both uncertainties is C, 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is inversely proportional to its lifetime:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i},
\]

where \( \tau_i \) is the lifetime of the state. The constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties for each state
- For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be significantly larger than the uncertainties \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \). The dominant uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so \( \Delta E \) must be much larger than this value.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \), so the states cannot be resolved.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than Option A and also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 10^4 \) times larger than \( \Delta E_1 \), which is sufficient for clear resolution.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is approximately equal to \( \Delta E_2 \) but much smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that provides an energy difference significantly larger than the uncertainties is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
