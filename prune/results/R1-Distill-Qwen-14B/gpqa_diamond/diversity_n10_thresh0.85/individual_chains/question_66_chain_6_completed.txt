Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc. The idea is that they're suppressed by some high energy scale, probably the Planck scale or something like that.

Wait, so what symmetries does SMEFT respect? I think that SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, so it should respect the same symmetries as the SM. But wait, some of these symmetries might be part of the SM's framework, others are more about the effective theory.

Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all its operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Effective theories like SMEFT should also preserve this because they're built as low-energy approximations. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM respects Poincaré symmetry, so SMEFT should too. Wait, but is Poincaré symmetry automatically included in SMEFT? Because SMEFT is formulated in a way that includes all possible terms that respect the SM gauge symmetry and Lorentz symmetry. So I think Poincaré symmetry is also respected. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

CP symmetry: Wait, what's the deal with that. The Standard Model doesn't have a global CP symmetry, but some of its operators might break CP. Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be renormalizable or at least have the same symmetry structure as the SM. So the SMEFT operators can violate CP, but not all of them necessarily. Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected. So do all operators in SMEFT have to respect CP?

Wait, the SM doesn't have a CP symmetry that is exact because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, right? So not all operators in SMEFT must respect CP symmetry. Hmm, so option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? The SM is CPT invariant. I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, especially when they have a Lorentz symmetry. Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT is conserved. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, putting it together. Which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT?

So the correct ones are Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4). So option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, the options are: 

A) 1,2

C)1,2,4

So the correct answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that incorporates higher-dimensional operators suppressed by a high energy scale. These operators are constructed to respect the same symmetries as the SM, as SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory derived from the SM.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT is built to respect Lorentz symmetry. This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory, including SMEFT.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry and is formulated in a relativistic framework, it also respects Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not have an exact CP symmetry due to phenomena like CP violation in the CKM matrix. SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, meaning CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, particularly in Lorentz-invariant theories like SMEFT. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
