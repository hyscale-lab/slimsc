Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through it step by step. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH to form product 1. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at a low temperature, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break this down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo elimination to form an alkene. This is the dehydrohalogenation reaction, which typically gives alkenes via an E2 mechanism. So product 1 should be 1,3-adamantadiene, which is an alkene. The NMR data given for product 1: a triplet at 4.79 ppm, which seems like it's from two equivalent protons. The other signals are from the adamantane structure. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, but wait, that sounds more like a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. Oh wait, product 1 is after heating with KOH. Wait, but if it's elimination, we'd get an alkene, which wouldn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the reactions. Let's think again.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. Could it be a substitution reaction instead of elimination? But KOH in such conditions usually leads to elimination, especially with vicinal dihalides. So that's probably elimination to form 1,3-adamantadiene, which would have a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Wait, I'm not sure about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromines on adjacent carbons in a ring. So elimination would produce a double bond in that ring, making it more strained, but adamantane is pretty rigid. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The NMR of
