Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break down the target molecule. It looks like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to another cyclohexane, with a hydroxy group and a methyl group on one carbon. Oh wait, no, waitâ€”wait, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then on the same carbon where the formyl is, there's a substituent: a cyclohexyl group with a hydroxy and methyl attached? Or wait, maybe I should draw the structure mentally. 

Wait, wait. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So it's a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group, and that methyl also has a hydroxyl group. So the structure on the cyclohexane is a carbon that's attached to a methyl group, which itself is connected to a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So the main molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, with the formyl group on carbon 1, and the same carbon has a substituent which is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is something like cyclohexane with a CHO group and a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group on the same carbon.

Wait, no. Let me get that right. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is the main part, and at position 1 (the same carbon as the aldehyde), there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So that substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(
