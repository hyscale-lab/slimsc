Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step. First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, during titration, I'll have to consider the moles of NaOH added and how that affects the solution at 25% and equivalence points.

So, initial step: diluting acetic acid. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and we add 20 cm³ of water. The total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? So the concentration after dilution can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, is that right? Let me calculate: 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol, and 40 cm³ is 40 mL. So 1 mmol /40 mL is 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, the next part is the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to form acetate ions (CH3COO^-). So for the equivalence point, I need to find the pH of a solution of sodium acetate.

Wait, but first, let's figure out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M * V = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the solution is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M, so 0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol. Then we diluted it to 40 cm³. So the moles after dilution are still 0.001 mol, because dilution doesn't change the number of moles, just the concentration.

So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V required is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question doesn't directly ask for the volume, just the pH at 25% titration and equivalence. So for equivalence point, the solution is sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), the solution will be basic. The pH can be found by calculating the Kb of the acetate ion, then finding the pH using the concentration.

But wait, at equivalence point, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate ions will be calculated based on the moles and the total volume at that point.

Wait, but wait, when we reach equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH (as calculated). The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³, so the total volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 cm³.

So moles of acetate ion are 0.001 mol (same as initial moles of acetic acid) in 0.05 L (50 cm³). So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Now, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So, the hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, then Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² /0.02, since Kb is very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] is ~1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but the options don't have a pH around 9.02. Looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic, but that doesn't make sense for a solution of sodium acetate. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, sodium acetate solution should be basic, so pH>7. But none of the options have equivalence pH above 7 except option A (8.52) and option D (6.92 which is below 7, so that can't be right). Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the Kb calculation. Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Then, concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol /0.05 L =0.02 M. Correct.

So Kb=5.405e-10, so x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= approx 1.04e-5, as before. So [OH-] is ~1.04e-5, which gives pOH of ~4.98, so pH is 14-4.98=9.02. But none of the options have that. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let's think again: the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (as calculated earlier). So when titrating, the initial solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH, and 25% titration would mean 25% of the moles have been neutralized.

Wait, no: wait, when you titrate, the 25% refers to the volume of NaOH added, not the moles. Because the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the amount of moles depends on the volume.

Wait, but the question says "at 25% titration", which could mean 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. Since equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH (from earlier calculation), 25% would be 2.5 cm³. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express this properly.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol, right? So at the equivalence point, all of that is neutralized by NaOH. So 25% titration would mean 0.25 * 0.001 mol NaOH added, which is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, no. Because the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So if the equivalence point requires 0.001 mol NaOH, then 25% of that is 0.00025 mol NaOH added. So yes, that's correct.

So during the titration at 25%, the moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, the initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 mol. So moles of CH3COOH remaining is 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- formed is 0.00025 mol.

The total solution volume at 25% titration is initial volume (40 cm³) plus NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 /0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that: log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85)=0.267, so log(1.85e-5)= -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, [A^-] is 0.005882, [HA] is 0.017647. So the ratio is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.333.

So log(0.333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Rounded to two decimal places, that's about 4.26.

Okay, so that's the pH at 25% titration. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH, and 8.52 as equivalence. Option D has 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but earlier I thought the equivalence point pH should be around 9.02, but none of the options have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration of sodium acetate. Let me check that again.

At equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol. Which is exactly the same as moles of acetic acid, so all the acetic acid is converted to acetate.

The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus NaOH (10 cm³), so 50 cm³. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, Kb is (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) =5.405e-10. Then, as before, [OH^-] is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So pOH is about 4.98, pH is 14 -4.98 = 9.02.

But none of the options have this. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution isn't just sodium acetate; maybe I should consider the exact reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the concentration of acetate.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) at the equivalence point, but wait, at equivalence, all HA is converted to A^-. So [A^-] is from the salt, but [HA] is zero. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, at equivalence, the solution is just the conjugate base, so it's a solution of A^- in water.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as a solution of sodium acetate, which undergoes hydrolysis.

So, the concentration is 0.02 M. Kb is 5.405e-10.

The acetate ion reacts with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is [OH^-], so:

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 -x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 M → [OH^-] =1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH =14-4.98=9.02.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a wrong approach somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the equivalence point's volume. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial solution after dilution is used in the titration, so let me double-check that.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, so total 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid is (0.05 M *20 cm³) /40 cm³ =0.025 M. Correct.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, V=0.001/0.1=0.01 L=10 cm³. So total volume is 40+10=50 cm³.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001/0.05=0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb or pKa. Let me recalculate pKa.

Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

Let me compute that accurately. log(1.85)=0.267, so log(1.85e-5)= 0.267 -5= -4.733. So pKa=4.733.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is 0.02 M acetate ion. The Kb is correct, so the calculation should be correct. So the pH should be around 9.02, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I approached the problem.

Wait, looking at the options, option A's equivalence pH is 8.52. Let me see what that would correspond to. Let's say that the pH is 8.52. Then pOH is 14-8.52=5.48.

[OH^-] is 10^(-5.48) ≈ 2.98e-6 M.

Then Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] → Kb ≈ (2.98e-6 * x ) /0.02, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Kb using this pH.

Wait, the pH at equivalence is 8.52, so [H+] is 10^-8.52 ≈ 3.0e-9 M.

But since Kw=1e-14, [OH^-]=1e-14 /3e-9 ≈ 3.33e-6 M. Then, Kb is ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming that [CH3COOH] is approximately equal to [OH^-], since the hydrolysis reaction produces equal amounts. So:

Kb ≈ (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² /0.02.

If [OH^-] is 3.33e-6, then Kb would be (3.33e-6)^2 /0.02 ≈1.11e-11 /0.02 =5.55e-10, which is close to our calculated Kb of 5.405e-10. So this would correspond to a pH of about 8.52, which is option A. But why is our earlier calculation giving 9.02, but in reality the pH is around 8.52? Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-]. Let me re-calculate.

If Kb =5.405e-10, and [A^-] =0.02 M.

x² = Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pH from [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But according to option A, the pH would be 8.52, which would imply a higher [OH^-], which would mean a higher Kb. But my Kb is correct. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact solution, not the approximation.

The equation is x²/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Let me solve this accurately. Let x be [OH^-].

So x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Rearranging, x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Which is (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈4.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible).

sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈6.575e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.575e-6 ] /2.

We take the positive root, so x≈ (6.575e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.575e-6)/2 ≈3.2875e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is approximately 3.2875e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=14-5.485=8.515, which is approximately 8.52.

Oh! Wait, I see where I went wrong before. I thought Kb=5.405e-10 and used x²= Kb * C, but that's an approximation valid when Kb is very small and C is not too small. But perhaps in this case, the approximation isn't accurate enough, so I have to solve the quadratic equation.

So, the correct pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52, which matches option A's second value. So that would make the equivalence pH 8.52.

But earlier, when I used the approximation, I got pH=9.02, but the more accurate calculation gives 8.52. So that's why option A has 8.52 as the equivalence pH.

Wait, that's a crucial mistake I made earlier. I assumed x was negligible compared to 0.02, but perhaps that's not the case. Because Kb is about 5e-10 and concentration is 0.02 M, so the approximation x << 0.02 might not hold. So the quadratic approach is necessary, which gives a lower x, leading to a lower pH.

So, with that, the equivalence pH is approximately 8.52, matching option A. But wait, let's check the first part.

At 25% titration, we calculated the pH as 4.26. So the option that has 4.26 and 8.52 is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the equivalence pH should be around 9, but the correct calculation gives 8.52. So that must be the correct approach.

Wait, let's recast the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: for sodium acetate, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = 0.5 (pKa + pKw) ?

No, wait, that's for salts where the acid and base are equally strong, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, the pH of a sodium acetate solution can be calculated using:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). But at equivalence, HA is zero, but that's not correct. No, actually, HA is all converted to A^-, so [HA] is zero. Wait, no, that's not the case. Because when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution is a buffer only if some of the base hasn't reacted yet. At equivalence, all the HA is converted to A^-, so it's a solution of A^- in water.

So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the pH based on the hydrolysis of A^-.

Which brings me back to the earlier approach.

So, with the more accurate calculation, pH at equivalence is 8.52, and at 25% titration, we have pH 4.26.

So the correct option is A) 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, looking at the options again, option D) has pH 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the 25% calculation?

Wait, let me recheck the 25% titration calculation.

At 25% titration:

Moles of NaOH added = 25% of 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed =0.00025 mol.

Total solution volume is 40 +2.5=42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 /0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Concentration of CH3COO^-:0.00025/0.0425≈0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) =4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647).

0.005882/0.017647 =0.333.

log(0.333)= -0.477.

So, pH=4.733 -0.477≈4.256 → 4.26. So that's correct.

Thus, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So option A is correct.

But looking back, I see that in my initial calculation of the equivalence point, I thought the pH was around 9, but with the quadratic solution, I got 8.52. So option A is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is:

A) 4.26; 8.52.

So that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ at 0.05 M, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the concentration after dilution is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we analyze the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \cdot 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.25 \cdot 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

After the reaction, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total solution volume at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming a solution of sodium acetate. The moles of sodium acetate are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion undergoes hydrolysis:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant \(K_b\) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x \ll 0.02\), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using the quadratic solution for \(x\), the more accurate pH is found to be approximately \(8.52\).

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is \(4.26\), and the pH at the equivalence point is \(8.52\). The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
