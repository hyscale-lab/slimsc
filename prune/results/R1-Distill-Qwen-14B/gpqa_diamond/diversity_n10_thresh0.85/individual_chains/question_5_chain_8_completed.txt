Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Let me try to unpack what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states with definite values.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so I think it's composed of components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem gives each component as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are often scaled by ħ/2 in such contexts.

Let me write down each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is a vector operator, and when you have an operator in an arbitrary direction, you need to construct the operator along that direction. The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it has components (nx, 0, nz). But since it's in the x-z plane, ny is zero.

The operator along n would be P · n = nx P_x + nz P_z, because the y-component of n is zero. Because the direction is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane, so n can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis. So nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since we're in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So, n is in the x-z plane, so φ=0, so nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So the operator along direction n, let's call it P_n, would be:

P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z
= (sinθ) (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ) (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]
= (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, let me compute that matrix:

The first matrix is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2. Wait no, wait. Wait, nx is sinθ, so (sinθ)*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, (ħ/2) sinθ], [ (ħ/2) sinθ, 0 ]]. And the second term is (cosθ)*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[ (ħ/2) cosθ, 0 ], [0, -(ħ/2) cosθ ]].

So when we add them together, the matrix P_n becomes:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me make sure, because when you add, the diagonal elements are (ħ/2 cosθ) and (-ħ/2 cosθ), and the off-diagonal are both (ħ/2 sinθ). So correct.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = λ |v>, where λ = ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ) - λ , (ħ/2 sinθ) ] 
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), -(ħ/2 cosθ) - λ ] ] 
* [v1; v2] = 0

Substituting λ = ħ/2:

The matrix becomes:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 , ħ/2 sinθ )
  (ħ/2 sinθ, -(ħ/2 cosθ) - ħ/2 ) ]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ (cosθ -1, sinθ )
           (sinθ, -cosθ -1 ) ]

Hmm. So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ (cosθ -1, sinθ ), (sinθ, -cosθ -1) ] * [v1; v2] = 0

Since ħ/2 is a scalar, we can divide both sides by it, so the equation reduces to:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Now, we have two equations:

1) (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
2) sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

We can solve for v1 and v2. Let me take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

=> v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1

Assuming sinθ is not zero, which I think is the case since n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so θ can vary from 0 to π, so sinθ is zero only when θ is 0 or π, which are special cases. But for a general eigenvector, let's proceed.

So v2 = ( (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ) v1

I can write this as:

v2 = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) ] v1

Because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So that simplifies to:

v2 = [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ] v1
= tan(θ/2) v1

So the ratio v2/v1 is tan(θ/2). Let me denote v1 as a parameter, say 'a'. So v1 = a, and v2 = a tan(θ/2).

The eigenvector is then proportional to (1, tan(θ/2)) ). To make it a unit vector, I need to find the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2 = 1.

So |a|^2 [1 + tan²(θ/2) ] = 1.

But 1 + tan²x = sec²x, so:

|a|^2 * sec²(θ/2) =1
=> |a|^2 = cos²(θ/2)
=> a = cos(θ/2) or -cos(θ/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is:

v = ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) )

Wait, because v2 = tan(θ/2) v1 = [sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2)] * cos(θ/2) ) = sin(θ/2).

So the components are (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which are real numbers, and their squares add up to cos² + sin² = 1.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but I'm not sure if the question asks for the normalized eigenvector. Let me check.

The question says, "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So yes, the vectors need to be normalized.

But wait, the options also have some with hbar in them, like option A and D. So wait, the eigenvectors in quantum mechanics are usually normalized, but the components don't have ħ. Because ħ is a unit of action, and the eigenvectors are dimensionless. Wait, but the options have ħ. Hmm, perhaps the vectors are not normalized in ħ terms? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, the components in option C are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which are dimensionless. But the eigenvector I found has components without ħ.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the eigenvalue equation. Let me double-check.

The operator P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix, so when I write the eigenvalue equation, it's P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So the matrix equation is [matrix] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Thus, the matrix [matrix] is equal to (ħ/2) times the identity matrix plus the other terms. Wait, no. Let me re-express this.

The matrix equation for the eigenvalue is (P_n - λ I) |v> = 0.

So P_n is (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, earlier calculation was, with substitution of nx and nz.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the matrix.

Wait, P_n is nx P_x + nz P_z.

nx is sinθ, nz is cosθ.

So P_n = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P_n = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no. Let me recompute:

P_x is [[0, 1],[1,0]], so nx * P_x is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]] * (ħ/2).

P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so nz * P_z is [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]] * (ħ/2).

So adding them together, P_n is (ħ/2) times:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So then the eigenvalue equation is:

( P_n - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So subtracting (ħ/2) from the diagonals.

The matrix becomes:

[ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, no. Because P_n is (ħ/2)*matrix, so (P_n - λ I) would have the matrix (matrix) - (λ/(ħ/2)) I.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me write the equation again.

The eigenvalue equation:

P_n |v> = λ |v>

Where λ = ħ/2.

So substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [v1; v2] = (ħ/2) [v1; v2]

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ] , 
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] * [v1; v2] = 0

Same as before.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ )

Which simplifies to (1, tan(theta/2)), as I found earlier.

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. So why are other options present? Let me look at all options.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) – seems dimensioned with hbar, which doesn't fit because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta) – that's spherical coordinates in terms of theta and phi, but from what I've calculated, it's theta/2.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) – matches what I got.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) – here the components are scaled by sqrt(2/3 hbar) and sqrt(1/3 hbar), but I don't think that applies here. Also, includes hbar which seems off.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization of n. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem using the general formula for spin-1/2 systems. The eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices.

The operator P along a direction n is given by (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z ). The eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

In this case, since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y =0, so the operator is (ħ/2)(n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z )

The spin-up state along n is given by the eigenvector of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The general formula for the spin-up state along direction n is:

( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) )

But since in our case, n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the state is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches option C.

So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as follows:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z
\]

Substituting the given components:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0
\]

Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ and the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, the matrix becomes:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]

From the first row, $(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0$, we find:

\[
v_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_1
\]

Using the trigonometric identities $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:

\[
v_2 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1
\]

Let $v_1 = \cos(\theta/2)$ (to ensure normalization), then $v_2 = \sin(\theta/2)$. Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — This includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.  
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it involves $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$.  
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ — This matches the derived eigenvector exactly.  
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ — This includes incorrect scaling factors and $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the normalization of eigenvectors.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
