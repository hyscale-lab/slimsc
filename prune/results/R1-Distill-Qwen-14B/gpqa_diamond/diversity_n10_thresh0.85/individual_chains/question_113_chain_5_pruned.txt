Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound. The options are four different formulas, so I'll have to go through the given spectroscopic data step by step.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1 is probably from O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic carbonyl or maybe an amide. Wait, but amides usually have N-H stretches too, but that's not mentioned here.

Wait, the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests there's an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. But if it's an aromatic ring, the hydrogens would be on the ring, but I think vinyl is more like CH2=CH- type. So maybe the compound has a double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. What's 45? Let's think. The molecular ion could be for C3H7O or something. Wait, 45 is C3H7O? Wait, the molecular weight of 45 would be possible for a fragment. Let me calculate. 45: Carbon is 12, Hydrogen is 1, Oxygen is 16. So for C3H7O: (3*12)+(7*1)+(16) = 36 +7 +16=59. No, that's not 45. Hmm, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone or ester. Or, maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CO. Let me see: (CH3)2CO is acetone. Its molecular weight is (2*12 + 6*1) + 12 + 16 = (30) + 12 +16=58? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, acetone is C3H6O. So 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 16=16. Total 58. So m/z 45 isn't that. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be another fragment. Maybe it's an ester group breaking apart. For example, if the compound is an ester, like RCOOR', then the ester group might break into RCOO+ and R'. The RCOO+ would have a molecular weight of (R's weight) plus 60 (since COO is 44, but wait, maybe not. Let me think: the ester group is R-O-CO-O-R', no, wait, ester is RCOOR', so the fragment after losing R' could be RCOO+ which would be (12+16)*2 + (something else? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 is from a smaller group. For example, 45 could be a CH2COO fragment? Let me see: CH2COO would be 45? Let's calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. CH2COO is 2 carbons, so 2*12=24, 3 H's (since CH2 is two H's, COO has two O's but no H's except maybe from another part? Wait, perhaps it's a different approach. The molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2. So the molecular
