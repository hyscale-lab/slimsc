Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic physics, but let's think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium usually has 3 protons because it's Li-7, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, Li is element 3, so it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, Li has several isotopes. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass number 6. So X is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about finding the energy of the RHIC, which I think relates to the kinetic energy of the ions. Because the collider accelerates ions to high speeds, so the energy here is likely the kinetic energy.

Wait, but when dealing with relativistic speeds, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But sometimes, the term 'energy' in these contexts refers to the kinetic energy. I need to clarify that.

But given the options are around 18 GeV to 23 GeV, I should calculate the total energy, which is gamma times the rest energy, but then subtract the rest energy to get kinetic energy? Or
