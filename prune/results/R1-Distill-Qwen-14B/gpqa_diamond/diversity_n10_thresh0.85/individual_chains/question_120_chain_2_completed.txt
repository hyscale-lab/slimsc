Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I think is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax, so d = 1/plx. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases because the star is closer. Oh wait, no, wait—parallax is in arcseconds, and the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So a larger parallax means a nearer star.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, imagine we have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx. How many stars are in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means that the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on that volume.

But wait, how does parallax relate to volume? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. So if we have a range of parallaxes, that corresponds to a range of distances.

Let me consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d times the thickness, right? So volume V = 4πd² * dd.

But since plx is 1/d, I can write d as 1/plx. So substituting, V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx). Because dd would be the change in d, but since d = 1/plx, dd = -1/(plx²) * dplx. Wait, that negative might not matter here because we're considering absolute volume. So plugging d into V, V is proportional to (1/plx^2) * dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So for a given dplx (a small change in parallax), how many stars are there? Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume is number density (n) times the volume. So number of stars N in a shell is n * V.

But wait, the number per unit parallax range would be N/(dplx). Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx, which is the same as the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx, divided by dplx. So I think that's the number density in plx space.

So N per dplx is (n * V) / dplx. Substituting V from above:

V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx) as I had before. Wait, but d is 1/plx, so dd is the change in d, which is -d^2 * dplx (since d = 1/plx; derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx^2)). So the change in d is ( -1/(plx^2) ) * dplx. But when considering the volume element, it's 4π d² dd. So substituting, 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -dplx/(plx^2) ) = 4π d^2 dd.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think differently. Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is constant (n), say n stars per cubic parsec.

The volume between parallax plx and plx + dplx is the volume between distances 1/plx and 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, but since d is 1/plx, the volume between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd. So the volume as a function of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -dplx/(plx^2) ), because dd = -d^2 dplx. Hmm, this might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of plx. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the difference between the volumes at those parallaxes.

The volume for a sphere of radius d is (4/3)π d³. Wait, no—wait, no, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is the surface area times the thickness. So it's 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx, and dd = -d² dplx (because d = 1/plx: so derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx²)). So substituting, 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx^2)) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, because 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx^2)) ) = 4π (1/(plx^2)) * (-dplx/(plx^2)) ) = 4π ( -dplx ) / (plx^4).

But when considering the number of stars per unit parallax, we take the number of stars in that shell (n * 4π d² dd) and divide by dplx (the range in parallax). So that's (n * 4π d² dd ) / dplx.

Substituting dd as (-d^2 dplx), so:

(n *4π d² * (-d^2 dplx) ) / dplx = n *4π d^4 (-1).

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction, so in terms of magnitude, the number is proportional to d^4.

Since d = 1/plx, d^4 is (1/plx)^4 = 1/plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, so looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

But wait, did I make a mistake in the substitution? Let me double-check.

Wait, the number of stars per unit plx is (number of stars) / (dplx).

Number of stars in the shell is n * 4π d² dd.

So (n *4π d² dd ) / dplx.

But dd = ( -1/(plx^2) ) * dplx.

So substituting:

n *4π d² * ( -dplx/(plx^2) ) ) / dplx.

The dplx cancels out, so we have n *4π d² * (-1/(plx^2)).

But d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/(plx^2).

So substituting d²:

n *4π * (1/(plx^2)) * ( -1/(plx^2) ) ) = n *4π * ( -1/(plx^4) ).

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, the number decreases, which makes sense. The magnitude is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is ~ 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). For a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume of the shell is \( V = 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Thus, the volume becomes \( V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \).

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume itself. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).
- **C) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \).
- **D) ~ \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
