Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. What will be the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point? The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D.

Alright, so I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, the pH changes based on how much of the base has been added. At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. At equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, and the solution is a salt solution. 

First, I think I should find out the initial concentration after dilution. Then calculate the equivalence point volume. Let me break it down.

So, initial concentration of acetic acid before dilution is 0.05 M. We have 20 cm³ of this. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the dilution is doubling the volume, which would halve the concentration. So the new concentration is 0.025 M. Let me verify that:

M1V1 = M2V2 → (0.05 M)(20 cm³) = M2*(40 cm³). So M2 = (0.05*20)/40 = 1/4 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Next, the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.

To find the equivalence point, I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So moles = M * V (in liters). 

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) → 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals 0.001 moles. 

NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / M → 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and we're adding NaOH. So the equivalence point volume would be 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the question isn't about the equivalence point's volume; it's about pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So for 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, let's address the 25% titration point.

At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of acetic acid neutralized = 0.00025, so remaining moles of acetic acid = initial moles - 0.00025 = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Also, moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed = 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

But wait, the concentrations are in the solution. The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = moles HA / V = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = ?

Wait, wait. Let me calculate these concentrations.

Moles HA = 0.00075 mol → [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

Moles A^- = 0.00025 → [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/1.85e-5) → log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → approx 0.267 + (-5) → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → 4.733 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. Which is approximately 4.26. Hmm. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So wait, but wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the ratio. [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Yep. So log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is about 4.26. So that's one part done. The first pH is 4.26. Looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26, but the second value is 8.52. But I'm not done yet. I need to also find the pH at the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions will be determined by the moles of acetate and the total volume.

Moles of acetate: equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.

Total volume at equivalence: initial solution (40 cm³) + volume of NaOH added (10 cm³) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^- ] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate ion acts as a base in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Since Kb is small, we can approximate the hydrolysis as:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb or something else.

Wait, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10, correct.

Concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → let's compute that.

The square root of 1.081e-11 is approximately 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, which gives pOH=4.98, so pH=9.02.

But looking at the options, none of them have a pH of 9.02 as the equivalence point. The options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52 → No, the equivalence is 8.52, but my calculation was 9.02.

B) 3.17; 6.73 → No.

C) 4.73;7.00 → No.

D) 4.57;6.92 → No.

Hmm, none of the options have around 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in determining the concentration of acetate at equivalence. Let me check again.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid are converted to acetate. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10 cm³ (NaOH added) → 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should consider that sodium acetate dissociates completely? No, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it does hydrolyze in solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me double-check.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb should be (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Hmm. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the pH at equivalence. Another approach would be to calculate the concentration of acetate, then find the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that x is small is not valid. Let me try without the approximation.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Let me let the change be x. So,

Initial: [CH3COO^- ] = 0.02 M, [CH3COOH]=0, [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^- ] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small), [CH3COOH]=x, [OH^-]=x.

So Kb = (x^2) / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = log(1/(1.04e-5)) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so 4.98 as before.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. So why don't the options have this?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not using the correct initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, let me go back. When we diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, making 40 cm³ total. So the concentration is halved, so 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence point, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. So moles of NaOH is 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol, which matches the moles of acetic acid. So that's correct.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the pH at the equivalence point. Maybe I should consider the exact solution without assuming x is negligible.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

Let x be [OH^-] = [CH3COOH].

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so previous approximation holds. So x ≈ 1.04e-5.

But if I proceed without approximation:

x² = Kb (0.02 - x) → x² = 5.4
