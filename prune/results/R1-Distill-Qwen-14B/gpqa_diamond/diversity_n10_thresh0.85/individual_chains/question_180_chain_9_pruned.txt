Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energies, it's related to how they're arranged. Since all the charges are identical, they'll either repel each other or attract, depending on their signs. Wait, each charge is 2e. So, if e is the elementary charge, 2e would mean each charge is positive if e is positive. So, like charges repel, so their potential energy would be positive, and I think the system would have a minimum energy when the charges are as close as possible? Or wait, no, maybe the opposite. Wait, the potential energy between two like charges is positive, so bringing them together would increase the potential energy. But wait, the system is isolated, so perhaps the charges are fixed in their positions? Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the problem says 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. So the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 is at a point 2 meters away from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, but each charge is 2e. So the 13th charge is fixed at P, so it's one charge of 2e, and the other 12 are each 2e, located on a spherical surface of radius 2 meters around P.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think the potential energy between the charges would be what contributes to the total energy.

Wait, in a system of charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. Since each pair contributes, I need to calculate all the interactions.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

In this scenario, the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away. Each of those 12 charges will interact with the 13th, and also with each other.

So let's break it down.

Each of the 12 charges (at 2 m from P) will have a potential energy with the 13th charge. So for each of the 12, the potential energy U_i is (k * q1 * q2) / r. Here, q1 and q2 are both 2e, and r is 2 meters.

So for each of these 12 interactions, the potential energy is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). That's k*(4e²)/(2) = 2k e².

So since there are 12 such charges, each contributing 2k e², the total for this part would be 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges is interacting with it. So each of the 12 pairs (the 13th and each of the 12) contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e². So 12 * 2 k e² would be 24 k e².

But that's just the energy between the 13th charge and the others. Now, I also have to account for the potential energy between each of the 12 charges themselves. Because each of the 12 charges at 2 m from P would exert a mutual repulsion on each other.

So, how many pairs are there among the 12 charges? Well, for n charges, the number of unique pairs is n choose 2, which is (n*(n-1))/2. So for n=12, that's (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs.

Each of these pairs is two charges, each with 2e, and their separation distance is... Hmm, wait. They're all located on a sphere of radius 2 m around P. But their exact positions on the sphere can vary, which affects the distance between any two charges. Oh, but wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their arrangement (like on a sphere) isn't specified beyond that. So, perhaps for the minimum energy, the charges are arranged such that each pair is as close as possible, but wait, wait, that might not be the case. Because if they're all on a sphere, the minimum distance between any two would be
