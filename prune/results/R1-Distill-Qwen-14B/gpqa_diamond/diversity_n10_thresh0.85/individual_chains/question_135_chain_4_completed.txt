Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, I remember from my studies that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The question gives me the interaction Lagrangian, so I should probably start by looking at that.

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh right, it's probably L = -λ ψ_f (y) (ψ_f (y)) (ῡ + X(y)) something. Wait, maybe it's more like L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f? No, perhaps the correct form is L = -λ f (ῡ + X) ψ_f ψ_f. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Oh wait, maybe it's -λ f (ῡ + X) ψ_f^dagger ψ_f? Because typically, the interaction term would involve the field X coupling to two fermions. So perhaps the correct expression is something like L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, but that would be dimensionally incorrect unless there's a Yukawa coupling structure.

Wait, I think the standard Yukawa interaction is L = -g ψ^dagger ψ X, where g is a coupling constant. So in this case, the mass term would come from the term involving υ, which is the vacuum expectation value. So when X is zero, the term becomes -λ f ψ_f ψ_f (ῡ), which would give a mass term for ψ_f, implying that ψ_f has a mass λ υ f? Or maybe I'm getting that mixed up.

But the key point is the interaction term is proportional to X times ψ_f times ψ_f. So the vertex would be X boson coupling to two fermions ψ_f. So the decay of X would be into a pair of these fermions. So the fermions that X can decay into are the ones that are present in the interaction term, right?

Wait, but the Lagrangian given seems to have a structure where X couples to a fermion ψ_f. So the fermions involved are ψ_f, which I'm assuming is a fermion field like maybe a quark or lepton.

But the problem says the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the possible decay products must have combined mass less than 6 GeV? Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

Wait, but for each fermion pair, the sum is twice the mass of the fermion, since each is a particle and anti-particle. So for X → f f̄, the mass of f must be less than 3 GeV, because 2m_f < M_X.

But wait, wait. Fermions come in different generations. Let me list the masses of the known fermions. 

Leptons: electrons are about 0.511 MeV, muon is about 105.7 MeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV. 

Quarks: up and down are light, around a few MeV each. The strange quark is around 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is about 173 GeV.

Wait, so let's think about this. The X boson has mass 6 GeV. So any fermion pair it decays into must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m < 6 GeV → m < 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses under 3 GeV? Let's see:

Electron: 0.511 MeV – way under.
Muon: ~0.1 GeV – under.
Tau: 1.78 GeV – under 3 GeV.
Up quark: ~2 MeV – way under.
Down quark: ~4-5 MeV – still way under.
Strange quark: ~100 MeV – under.
Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV – under.
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV – which is over 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b and b-bar, because 2 * 4.5 GeV = 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So that decay is not allowed.

Top quark is way heavier, so no decay into top.

So the possible fermions are: e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but which of these are actually present in the interaction term? Because the Lagrangian tells us which fermions X can interact with.

Looking back, the interaction term is L = -λ f (ῡ + X) ψ_f ψ_f. Wait, maybe I misread it. Oh wait, the term is -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the fermions in the interaction are ψ_f, which I think are the ones that X couples to. So X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f.

So which ψ_f are present in the Standard Model? For example, if ψ_f represents quarks, then they can be up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But considering the mass of X is 6 GeV, which can't reach top or bottom as I thought earlier.

Wait, but alternatively, if the ψ_f are leptons, then they could be e, mu, tau; or if they're quarks, then up, down, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible fermion pairs. The options given include things like b b-bar, s s-bar, etc.

Looking at the options, option C includes c c-bar, which would be allowed because charm quarks are about 1.5 GeV each. 2 * 1.5 is 3 GeV, which is under 6.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the fermions under 3 GeV.

Option A includes b, but that's over.

So the allowed fermions are all with m < 3 GeV. So that includes e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That seems correct because all these fermions have masses below 3 GeV.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is not allowed because 2 * 173 GeV is way over 6 GeV.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct option would be B.

Wait, but I should check the mass limits again. Let me list the rest masses:

Electron: 0.000511 GeV.

Muon: ~0.1057 GeV.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV.

Up quark: ~0.002 GeV.

Down: ~0.004 GeV.

Strange: ~0.1 GeV.

Charm: ~1.5 GeV.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV (so 2 * 4.5 = 9 GeV >6, so can't decay into b-bbar).

So allowed are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So all the fermion pairs in option B are allowed, except for any that have fermions above 3 GeV. For example, c is 1.5 GeV, so 2 * 1.5=3 <6, so allowed.

So option B includes all these possibilities.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B says X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's all the allowed ones except the bottom quark. So B is correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \), and the decay products must satisfy the condition that the combined rest mass of the fermion-antifermion pair is less than 6 GeV. This implies that the mass of each fermion must be less than 3 GeV.

The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- **Leptons**: Electron (\( \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)), Muon (\( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)), Tau (\( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- **Quarks**: Up (\( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)), Down (\( \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \)), Strange (\( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)), Charm (\( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)), Bottom (\( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)), Top (\( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)).

From this, the fermions with masses less than 3 GeV are: \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the allowed decays of \( X \) are into pairs of these fermions.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark has a mass of \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( 2 \times 4.5 \, \text{GeV} = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\e^- \), all of which are allowed since their masses are less than 3 GeV.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark has a mass of \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeding the mass of \( X \).
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
