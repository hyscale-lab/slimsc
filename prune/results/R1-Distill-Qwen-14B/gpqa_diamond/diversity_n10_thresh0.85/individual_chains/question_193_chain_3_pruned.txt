Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to think it through.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what parallax means. Oh right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, plx = 1/distance or something close to that, right?

Wait, more accurately, parallax in parsecs (plx in arcseconds) is such that distance d (in parsecs) = 1 / plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to relate the number of stars (N) to distance (r). The given relation is N proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N proportional to (1/(1/d))^5, which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so they're asking about the number density as a function of distance. So maybe I need to think in terms of differential number, like how many stars are there between r and r + dr.

Let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number in a small shell dr at radius d would be proportional to d^5 * dr. Because for a thin shell, the volume is 4πd² dr, but wait, wait a second. No, wait, no, because the question is about a specific region of the sky, which suggests a fixed area. So maybe it's a surface density rather than a volume density?

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So it's for a specific region, which probably means that the area is fixed. So perhaps we're talking about surface density, not volume density. So number per unit area.

Hmm. So if it's surface density, then the number per unit area would be N = k
