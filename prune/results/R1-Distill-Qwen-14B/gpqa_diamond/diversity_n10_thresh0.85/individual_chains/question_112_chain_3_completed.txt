Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it says. Hmm, the question involves an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Then, I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator, and calculate the average value of that operator.

Wait, the operator is given with matrix elements A_ij. The elements are hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, otherwise zero. Oh wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with spin up and down states. Let me write that matrix out.

The operator A has elements:
A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1)
A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2
A_22 =0
Wait, no, wait. The question says A_ij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, it'll look like this:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0    ]

But wait, that's not correct. Because in a 2x2 matrix, the off-diagonal elements are A_12 and A_21. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of this operator A? Because the question asks about the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A is a spin operator in a different direction? Because the matrix looks familiar. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices, like sigma_x, sigma_y, or sigma_z? Let me think. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. 

Wait, but our operator A has elements that are hbar/2. So perhaps it's (hbar/2) times the Pauli X or another matrix. Let me see:

If A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, then the matrix would be [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. That matches the description. So A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, which means it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction. Those are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

But wait, let's double-check. Because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, with eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So yes, that's correct.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+a> and |-a> (just another notation for the eigenstates), which are the same as |+x> and |-x> scaled by sqrt(2), but since the operator is scaled by hbar/2, I think the eigenstates remain the same as sigma_x's.

Wait, no. The eigenstates are independent of the scaling factor. So, the eigenstates of A (which is (hbar/2) sigma_x) are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates.

So, the first step is to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> (or |+a> and |-a>), and then the coefficients will give the square moduli as the probabilities.

But first, let me normalize |alpha>. Because the given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, I need to find the normalization factor.

So, the state is |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where c is a normalization constant.

The normalization condition is |c|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 ] = 1.

Calculating each modulus squared:

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So, the sum is 2 +5=7.

So, |c|^2 *7 =1 → |c|=1/sqrt(7). So c=1/sqrt(7). Thus, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

Wait no, |alpha> is proportional, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> scaled by 1/sqrt(7).

So, |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express this in terms of |+x> and |-x> states.

As I thought earlier, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me make sure about the phase. Some conventions might have a negative in front for |-x>, but I think it's (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

To find a and b, express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>.

So,

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Expressing |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

Let me write |alpha> as a |+x> + b |-x>.

So,

(1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> = a (|up> + |down> ) + b (|up> - |down> )

= (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down>

Comparing coefficients:

For |up>: 1+i = a + b.
For |down>: 2 -i = a - b.

So we have a system of equations:

a + b = 1 + i.
a - b = 2 -i.

Let's solve for a and b.

Adding the two equations:

2a = (1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3 → a = 3/2.

Subtracting the two equations:

2b = (1 + i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i → b = (-1 +2i)/2.

So:

a = 3/2.

b = (-1 + 2i)/2.

Wait, let me double-check the subtraction:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i. Yes.

So, a = (3)/2, b = (-1 + 2i)/2.

But wait, in our state |alpha>, the coefficients are a and b, so the state is |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

But wait, the coefficients are a = 3/2, b = (-1 + 2i)/2.

Wait, but wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> / sqrt(7). So when expressed in |+x> and |-x>, it's (a |+x> + b |-x> ) / sqrt(7). Because |alpha> was scaled by 1/sqrt(7).

Wait no, I didn't include the scaling factor when solving for a and b. Let me correct that.

The correct equation is:

[ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Which is:

(1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> = sqrt(7) * [ a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

So,

(1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> = (sqrt(7)/sqrt(2)) [ (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down> ]

Therefore, equating coefficients:

1 + i = (sqrt(7)/sqrt(2)) (a + b )
2 - i = (sqrt(7)/sqrt(2)) (a - b )

Let me write this as:

a + b = (1 + i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

a - b = (2 - i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Now, adding the two equations:

2a = (1 + i + 2 -i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Simplify sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) as 1/sqrt(3.5) or sqrt(14)/7. So a = 3 * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(2 sqrt(7/2)).

Wait, maybe it's better to rationalize:

sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = sqrt(14)/7.

So,

a = (3 * sqrt(14)) / (2 *7 * 2?) Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)) = sqrt(14)/7.

So a = [ 3 * sqrt(14) ] / (2 * 7 )

Wait, let me compute a:

a = [3 * sqrt(2)] / (2 * sqrt(7)) )

But perhaps I can leave it as is for now.

Similarly, subtracting the equations:

2b = (1 +i - (2 -i)) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) ) → 2b = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → b = ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So, a and b are:

a = (3 sqrt(2) )/( 2 sqrt(7) )

b = ( (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) )/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Calculating |a|^2:

a = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|^2 = (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7 ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857.

Calculating |b|^2:

b = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The modulus squared is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 * (2) / (4 *7 )

Wait, sqrt(2) squared is 2, denominator is (2 sqrt(7))^2 → 4*7=28.

So, |b|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * 2 ] / (4 *7 )

= [ (1+4) * 2 ] / 28 = (5 *2 ) / 28 = 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357. Wait, but 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36. That's close to our 0.6428 and 0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait, the first part of the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of the operator A. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the second part is to compute the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, because the matrix is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2,0]] which is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So, <A> = <alpha| (hbar/2) sigma_x |alpha>.

But sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, and its expectation value in a spin state is equal to the expectation value when measured in the x-direction.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>,

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>,

so the expectation value <sigma_x> is |a|^2 (1) + |b|^2 (-1) + (a b* + a* b ) (0) I think?

Wait, wait, sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+x> and |-x> respectively. So:

<sigma_x> = |a|^2 *1 + |b|^2*(-1) + (a b^* + a^* b ) *0 ?

Wait, no. Because when you have a state expressed as a linear combination of eigenstates, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities times their eigenvalues.

So, <sigma_x> = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1).

Because |+x> has eigenvalue +1, |-x> has eigenvalue -1.

So in this case, <sigma_x> = (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) = (9-5)/14 =4/14=2/7.

So, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/(7).

Wait, that's hbar divided by 7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. That matches.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7). No, 2/sqrt(7) is about 0.75, not 1/7.

Wait, but let me compute again. Maybe I made a mistake in the expectation value.

Wait, <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) <sigma_x> = (hbar/2) * [ (9/14) - (5/14) ) ] = (hbar/2)*(4/14) )= (hbar/2)*(2/7)= hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.357, which rounds to approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first two numbers are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7.

Yes, that's the correct option.

Wait, but let me check the normalization again. Because in the state |alpha>, the coefficients when expressing in terms of |+x> and |-x> must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

We have |a|^2 =9/14, |b|^2=5/14. 9+5=14. So 14/14=1. Correct.

Another way to compute the average value is to use matrix representation. Let's see.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal.

So, A = (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

So, to calculate <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> 

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^* * A * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Compute it:

First, [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

Same for the other component: (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) (1 - i, 2 + i) ) * A * (1+i; 2 -i) ) / sqrt(7)

Wait, because when you multiply, you get 1/7 times the product.

So,

= (1/7) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ) ] * (hbar/2).

Wait, let me compute this:

Wait, the matrix A: [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So, A * |alpha> = [ (0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)(2 -i) ) , ( (hbar/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) ] / sqrt(7).

So,

First component: (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7).

Second component: (hbar/2)(1+i) / sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate of the first component times the second component of A |alpha>.

Wait, no. To compute <alpha| A |alpha>, it's the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A |alpha>.

So, let me compute A |alpha>:

A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 - i) (2 + i) + (2 - i)(1 + i) ) ] * (hbar/2) /7.

Wait, because when you multiply [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ) ].

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, <alpha| is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ), because it's the conjugate transpose.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (hbar/2) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ] / 7.

Wait, why? Because each term is the product of the corresponding components.

So,

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + 1*(-i) - i*2 + i^2(1) = 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) )= 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 + i^2 (i) = 2 +3i -1 = (2-1) +3i =1 +3i.

So, the sum is (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

Thus,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) * 2 /7 = (hbar/2) * (2)/7 = hbar /7.

Which matches the earlier result. So the average is hbar/7.

So, the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The state is normalized by dividing by \( \sqrt{7} \), resulting in:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

We rewrite \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
a = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{-1 + 2i}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are given by \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{2\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

To calculate the average value of \( A \), we use the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, the expectation value becomes:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_x \) are \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), corresponding to \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), respectively. Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Substituting this into \( \langle A \rangle \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options, the correct answer is:

**Probabilities:** \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), **Average value:** \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).
