Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star move a little. The star moves towards us, and then away, causing the spectral lines to shift back and forth. The speed of this shift is related to the planet's mass and orbital period.

The problem says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, we're looking for Period_2 / Period_1.

Hmm. I think the key here is the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period. The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the star's mass, among other factors.

Wait, I remember there's a formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity. The formula is something like K = (V) = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ] * [ (sin i) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) 

But wait, maybe I should think about the dependence on the period. Let me try to get the formula right. Another approach I've heard about is that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because for a given star and planet mass, a longer period (larger orbit) would cause a smaller velocity change in the star, so the semi-amplitude K would be smaller.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for K is: 

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_planet is much less than M_star (like Neptune vs Sun), we can approximate this as K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) c ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but maybe I can simplify this. Because both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune) and the stars have the same mass (similar to Sun). So M_planet and M_star are the same for both planets. So when comparing K1 and K2, since M_planet and M_star are the same, the ratio of K1 and K2 would depend on the inverse cube root of the periods.

Wait, because from the formula, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

So K1 = C / (P1)^(1/3)
K2 = C / (P2)^(1/3)
Where C is a constant for the same star and planet mass.

So taking the ratio, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)
Or, K2/K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)

Wait, no. Let me rearrange.

We have K1 = C / (P1)^(1/3)
K2 = C / (P2)^(1/3)
So K2 = K1 * (P1 / P2)^(1/3)

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio differently. If K increases, then the period must be smaller because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So a higher K means a smaller period. 

In the problem, Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstrom, Planet #2 has 7. So K2 is higher than K1. So since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a higher K implies a smaller period.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 compared to P1. So, the ratio is P2 / P1 = ?

Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/(K)^(3).

Wait, let me get that right. Let's think of K as proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K = k * (1/P)^(1/3), where k is some constant. So P = (k / K)^(3)

So for two planets, P1 = (k / K1)^3, P2 = (k / K2)^3.

So P2 / P1 = ( (k/K2)^3 ) / ( (k/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So P2/P1 = ( K1 / K2 )^3.

Because:

P1 = (k / K1)^3
P2 = (k / K2)^3
Divide them: P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, yes, because (k/K2)^3 divided by (k/K1)^3 is ( (K1)/(K2) )^3.

So since K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5), K1/K2 is 5/7. 

So (5/7)^3 is (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Which means P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. But the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 = 0.36 times, so it's 0.36 times as long. So it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the ratio. Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So if P2 is longer, then the ratio is greater than 1. If it's shorter, the ratio is less than 1.

Wait, when K is larger, the period is shorter. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K implies smaller P. So if Planet #2's K is higher (7 >5), then its period is shorter. So P2 is shorter than P1. So P2/P1 is less than 1. So the ratio is 0.36, meaning P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's not longer, it's shorter.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. That would be P2 divided by P1. So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's 36% as long. So it is shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times as long, so the ratio is 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure the formula is correct.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * P) / (2 π c) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But again, M_p << M_star, so it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * P) / (2 π c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But since both M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to (1/P)^(1/3) which is same as P^(-1/3). So K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3). So P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So the ratio of periods is (K2/K1)^(-3) because P ∝ 1/K^3. So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no. Wait, if P is proportional to 1/K^3, then P2 = (1/K2^3) * constant, P1 = (1/K1^3) * same constant. So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Yes, that's correct.

So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. K1/K2 =5/7 ≈0.714.

(5/7)^3 = (approx) 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So approximately 0.36 times as long. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, and the ratio is 0.36.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 * P1, then P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer is 0.36, which is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This implies that \( P \propto K^{-3} \).

For two planets with similar masses orbiting stars of the same mass, the ratio of their orbital periods can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's, and the ratio of their periods is approximately 0.36.
