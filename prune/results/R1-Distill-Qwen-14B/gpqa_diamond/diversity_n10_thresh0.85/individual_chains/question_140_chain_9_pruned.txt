Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's start by breaking down the question step by step.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially X and its analogs.

First, I need to identify what each substance could be. Let's start with the gas W. The molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That makes me think of a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Maybe something like H2O or CH4? Wait, no. Alternatively, if it's a diatomic molecule, like O2, but that's not right because O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in each atom, so each O would have 8 of each. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. But wait, the problem says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.

Another thought: CO2. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's the isotope ^12C, but wait, the question mentions substance X incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps the gas is CO2? Let's check. CO2 has carbon (6 protons, 6 neutrons if ^12C, but maybe a heavier isotope like ^13C or ^14C). Wait, but CO2 would have O as 8 protons each. So the molecule would have 6 (C) + 16 (O x2) = 22 protons. For neutrons: Let's see, if C is ^13C, then 7 neutrons, and each O is ^16O which has 8 neutrons each. So total neutrons would be 7 + 8*2 = 23. That's not equal to protons (22). Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. What about NH3? Let's see: N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So molecule has 7 + 3 =10 protons. Neutrons: N could be ^14N (7 neutrons) and H as ^1H (0 neutrons). So total neutrons would be 7. So 10 protons vs 7 neutrons—no, not equal.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the gas is H2O. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. H has 1 each. So H2O has 2 +8 =10 protons. For neutrons: 2*(0) +8=8. Not equal.

Wait, perhaps the gas is CH4. Carbon has 6 protons, each H has 1. So 6 +4=10 protons. Neutrons: Carbon could be ^12C (6), H has 0. So total neutrons would be 6. 10 vs 6, not equal.

Hmm. Maybe the gas is CO. Let's see: C has 6 protons, O has 8. So 6+8=14 protons. Neutrons: C could be ^13C (7) and O ^16O (8). So 7+8=15 neutrons. 14 vs 15—nearly equal but no.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something else. Maybe N2? Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if ^14N). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits. So W is N2 gas.

Wait, but N2 is diatomic, so each molecule is N2. So protons per molecule: 7*2=14. Neutrons per molecule: 7*2
