Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are some hints given, so I need to piece this together step by step.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the reaction steps. 

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B. I remember that HCN is typically used in the formation of nitriles from carboxylic acids, or maybe in the addition to carbonyl groups. Wait, wait, no—maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. For example, in the case of ketones or aldehydes, HCN can add to the carbonyl to form cyanohydrins. Or wait, another possibility: if compound A is a nitrile, then HCN would add... no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, A could be a carbonyl compound. Hmm.

2. Then, compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd, which is a catalyst. Reduction of what? If B is a nitrile, then reduction with H2 and Pd would give an amine. Wait, or maybe if B is a ketone, the reduction would produce a secondary alcohol. Alternatively, if B is an aldehyde, it would become a primary alcohol. Or if it's a cyano group, the reduction would produce an amine.

Wait, but the product is compound C. Let me think. So, starting from A, adding HCN gives B. Then B is hydrogenated to C. Then C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D loses an inert gas to form E.

Hmm, the key is to figure out what each step is doing. Let's think about each transformation in order.

First, A → B: HCN addition. So A is probably a carbonyl compound. Let's think, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin would have a hydroxyl group and a cyano group added to the same carbon as the carbonyl. So, for example, cyclohexanone would form a cyanohydrin where the OH and CN are adjacent.

Wait, but another possibility is that HCN is adding to a carbonyl. Let's say A is a cyclic ketone, like cyclopentanone. Then, HCN would add to give a cyanohydrin, which would be a diol with a CN group attached.

But wait, the problem is that after hydrogenation, compound C is formed. So if B is a cyanohydrin, then upon hydrogenation, what happens? The nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. The reduction of a nitrile typically gives an amine group. So, the hydrogenation of the cyanohydrin would convert the CN into an NH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps B isn't a cyanohydrin. Another possibility is that A is a carboxylic acid. HCN can react with carboxylic acids to form cyanohydrins, but I'm not sure that's the case here. Alternatively, if A is an ester, maybe it could react with HCN, but that's less common.

Wait another thought: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If A has a leaving group, like a bromide, and HCN acts as a nucleophile, then substitution occurs. But that doesn't seem to fit with the IR data given later.

Looking at the hints, the IR of A has a strong peak at around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So compound A must have a carbonyl group. So, A is likely a ketone or an aldehyde or an ester, etc. Wait, 1750 is a bit higher than a regular ketone, which is around 1700-1750. Maybe an ester or a ketone. So, let's say A is a cyclic ketone, like cyclopentanone or something similar.

So, A is a cyclic ketone. Then, when treated with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So, for cyclopentanone, adding HCN would form a 1-cyanocyclopentanol (or similar structure), but the exact structure depends on where the addition occurs.

Next step: compound B is treated with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, what's in B? B is a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group. So, hydrogenation would add hydrogen to triple bonds or nitriles. The nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. The nitrile group is typically reduced to an amine group. So, the nitrile (CN) becomes CH2NH2? Wait no, wait. The reduction of nitriles (RCN) with H2 and Pd gives amines (RCH
