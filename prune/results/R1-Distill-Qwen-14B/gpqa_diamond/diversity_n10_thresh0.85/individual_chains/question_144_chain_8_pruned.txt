Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters.

I remember that the mean decay distance (often called the decay length) depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like decay length L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find tau? Oh right, tau is related to the width Γ. The width Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime tau is given by tau = hbar / Γ. But wait, units here might be tricky. Let me think about the units.

Hbar (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So since Γ is given in GeV, I can compute tau in seconds. Then, I can find L using the velocity and gamma factors.

So first, let me calculate tau. Tau = hbar / Γ. The values are hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV·s, and Γ is 320 MeV. Oh wait, I need to convert Γ to GeV to match units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875, so tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, I need to find the velocity beta and gamma factor. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X =1.2 GeV, I can find gamma using the energy formula.

The total energy E is gamma * m c^2. Wait, but since c^2 is in GeV when m is in GeV/c², but perhaps for this purpose, I can compute gamma as E/(m c²). Wait, no, in natural units, c=1, so E = gamma * m. So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Beta is v/c, and beta can be found using the relation beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that. 1/gamma squared is (1/6.6667)^2 ≈ (0.15)^2 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.98868. So beta ≈ 0.98868.

Now, the decay length L is gamma * beta * c * tau. Let me compute each part.

First, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So, putting it all together:
gamma = 6.6667
beta ≈ 0.98868
c = 3e8 m/s
tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 s

So gamma * beta ≈ 6.6667 * 0.98868 ≈ let's calculate that. 6.6667 * 0.98 ≈ 6.533, but more precisely:

6.6667 * 0.98868 ≈ let's compute step by step.

6 * 0.98868 = 5.93208
0.6667 * 0.98868 ≈ 0.65912
Adding together: 5.93208 + 0.65912 ≈ 6.5912. So gamma*beta ≈6.5912.

Now, multiply by c and tau:

L = 6.5912 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s)

Wait, let's compute the units: seconds cancel out because tau is in s. So:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters. Then multiply by 6.5912:

6.170625e-16 * 6.5912 ≈ let's compute 6.170625 * 6.5912 ≈ 

Let me compute 6 * 6.5912 = 39.5472, 0.170625 *6.5912≈ 1.11953. So total approx 40.6667.

So 40.6667e-16 meters, which is 4.06667e-15 meters. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. Wait, but my calculation got approximately 4.06667e-15, which is close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). So the correct answer is B?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in gamma*beta or another step.

Wait, another approach: Compute gamma*beta more accurately.

gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.666666667.

beta is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt
