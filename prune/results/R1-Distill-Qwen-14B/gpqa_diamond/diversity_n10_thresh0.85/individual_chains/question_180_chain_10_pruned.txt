Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so the setup is that 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from point P, and one charge is fixed at P. All the particles have the same charge, 2e each. So each has a charge of twice the elementary charge.

Wait, so the system consists of 13 charges. 12 are each 2m away from point P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, meaning it doesn't move. The other 12 are fixed at 2m from P, but does that mean they're all at the same point 2m away, or arranged in some other way, like on a sphere around P?

Oh, wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So I'm thinking they're all located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around point P. But wait, perhaps they're arranged in some symmetric way, maybe on the surface of a sphere.

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is determined by their positions. Since the charges are identical and all are 2e, which is positive, right? Because e is the elementary charge, so positive. So all 13 charges are positive.

Wait, but wait. The 13th is fixed at P, and the others are each 2m away. So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2 ) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

Since all the charges are identical, and the problem is symmetric, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of each pair of charges.

But wait, the system is made up of 13 charges. So the total potential energy would be the sum of all
