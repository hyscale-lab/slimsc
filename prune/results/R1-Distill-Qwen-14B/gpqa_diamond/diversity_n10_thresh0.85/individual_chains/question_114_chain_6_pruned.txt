Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to figure out the reagents A and B from the options given. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H₂O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. Let me break it down.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methyl isopropyl ketone, I think) reacting with NaCN. I remember that in the presence of a base, ketones can undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction. Wait, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN⁻ ions, which is a nucleophile. So maybe it's an addition of cyanide to the ketone.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right, the cyanohydrin formation. That reaction typically uses an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4. Because the ketone's carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic, then the CN⁻ attacks. Then another proton and water are involved. So the product would be a secondary alcohol (from the CN adding, and then the OH comes from the water).

So looking at the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That structure makes sense for a cyanohydrin. The ketone (butan-2-one) would add the CN and OH groups in the same carbon, so in this case, the second carbon.

So for the first reaction, reagent A should be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or maybe NaHSO3? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the options. Let me look at the options provided.

Options are:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Wait, in the first reaction, A is the reagent used with NaCN. So the reagents in the options are the possible A and B. So for the first reaction, which is the cyanohydrin formation, the catalyst is usually an acid. So H3O+ (like in option A or B) or maybe NaHSO3 (which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Or wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which can act as a weak acid, providing H+.)

Wait, I think the cyanohydrin reaction typically uses an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+ (which is an acidic aqueous solution). So if reagent A is H3O+, that would fit the first reaction. So for reagent A, H3O+ is a good candidate. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure has a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O. The product is the corresponding acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but how does that happen? Usually, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. To convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you typically use strong acidic conditions. For example, under HCl in aqueous conditions, with heat. Alternatively, using H2O with a catalyst or under certain conditions
