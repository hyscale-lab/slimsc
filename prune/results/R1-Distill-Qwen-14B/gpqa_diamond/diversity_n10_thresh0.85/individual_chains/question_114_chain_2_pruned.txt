Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but ketones usually react with something like HCN, right? Oh, wait, NaCN in a acidic condition could be acting as a source of CN- nucleophile. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone.

But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN-, under certain conditions, the ketone would add the cyanide. But wait, I think that for the formation of a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group, maybe it's a two-step process. Oh, wait, or perhaps it's a hydrocyanation reaction? Or maybe it's the addition of HCN, but NaCN might not be enough. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a substitution reaction. No, ketones aren't typically good for substitution. Oh, wait. Maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, a cyanohydrin forms when a ketone reacts with HCN (or a source of it) in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the reaction would be acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the carbonyl.

So in this case, butan-2-one (a ketone) plus NaCN (which provides CN-) in the presence of an acid (so reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+). This would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks, forming a tetrahedral intermediate which then loses water to form the cyanohydrin, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

Now looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3 for A. So for the first part, A is likely H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction: the product from the first reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, is treated with reagent B (in H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So what's happening here? The nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Wait, how does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical reagents for this oxidation are things like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, perhaps with heat. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl and maybe some other oxidizing agent. Wait, but in the presence of water, what's the common method?

Wait, another approach: the nitrile could be hydrolyzed. Under acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze
