Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about stars and the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. Let me read the problem again.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, and without spots, it's higher. We're looking for the factor by which it changes—so (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots) would be the factor. Or wait, the question says, "the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots." So it's (ratio when no spots) / (ratio when spots present) = factor.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). So we can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations of two energy levels. The formula is:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Here, n2 is the number of atoms in level 2, n1 in level 1. g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels. E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and T is the temperature.

Since the problem gives us the wavelength of the transition, we can find the energy difference between the two levels. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Here, λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

But wait, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature drops. However, are the spots cooler than the surrounding photosphere? Typically, sunspots are cooler regions. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff drops. But I'm not sure if the spots are at a different temperature than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, the problem says when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the photospheric Teff is 5500 K. But wait, does that mean the average temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K, or is the spot temperature 5500 K while the rest is 6000 K?

Wait, the first part says that when the surface is not covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So that suggests that the entire photosphere has a lower average temperature when spots are present. But that doesn't quite make sense because spots are cooler regions; perhaps the average Teff is a combination of the hotter and cooler regions.

But maybe the problem is simplifying things. It says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps T_eff was measured as 5500 K when 40% is covered. So maybe the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? Or perhaps the spots have a lower temperature, but the rest is at 6000 K.

Wait, that might complicate things. Let me think. If 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature (spots), and the rest is at 6000 K, then the effective temperature is an average weighted by the areas. But the problem states that the overall photospheric Teff decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K. But the problem doesn't give the spot temperature directly.

Wait, but the problem says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that seems a bit odd because spots are cooler regions. Hmm, but maybe the problem is treating the entire photosphere as having a lower effective temperature when spots are present. Alternatively, perhaps the star's overall flux is decreased due to the spots, leading to a lower effective temperature.

Wait, I'm getting a
