Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Alright, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. So, the first thing I think is that the operator P is a vector operator, similar to angular momentum. That makes sense because in quantum mechanics, operators like angular momentum (L) are vectors composed of their components.

Wait, the problem says that n is in the x-z plane, so the direction is arbitrary but lies in x-z. That means the angle theta (θ) would be measured from the z-axis, and phi (φ) would be zero or 180, but since it's arbitrary, perhaps phi doesn't matter here. Alternatively, maybe the direction is represented by spherical coordinates with φ=0, so everything's along the x-z plane.

The operator P is along n, so it's P = n · (Px, Py, Pz). Oh, right, because the operator for the component along an arbitrary direction would be the dot product of the vector operator and the direction vector.

Wait, the operator along direction n is P_n = (n · P) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So, to find the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2, I need to write down the matrix for P_n and then find its eigenvectors.

Let me note down the matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P_n = n_x * Px + n_z * Pz. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Let's denote n_x = cosθ (assuming polar coordinates with θ measured from z-axis) and n_z = sinθ. Wait, wait, no. When θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n_x = sinθ cosφ, n_y = sinθ sinφ, n_z = cosθ. But since n is in x-z plane, φ is zero, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Wait, wait, no: if the direction is along the x-z plane, then the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So in that case, n_x would be sinθ cosφ, but since φ=0, it's sinθ. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, substituting into P_n:

P_n = (sinθ)(ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me compute this matrix.

First, the (ħ/2) factor is common. So,

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is:
[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is:
[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding them together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ]
