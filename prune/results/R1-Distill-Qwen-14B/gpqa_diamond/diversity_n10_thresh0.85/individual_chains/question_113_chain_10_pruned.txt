Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can figure out.

First, the question gives me three main pieces of data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying H and O counts.

Starting with the FTIR. The very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group. Because if it's a very broad peak around there, that's typical for O-H stretching in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which might indicate a carbonyl group. But wait, 1650 is a bit lower. Could that be a conjugated carbonyl or something else?

Thinking about the carbonyl. At 1700, that's typical for a ketone or an aldehyde or maybe an ester. But 1650 is a bit lower, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like in an aromatic ketone or something). Or maybe it's an amide, but wait, the options don't have N, so probably not.

Wait, another possibility: the two peaks at 1700 and 1650. Maybe one is a carbonyl, and the other is something else. Oh, perhaps an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Wait, the aromatic C=C is usually around 1600 cm^-1. But 1650 is maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe an conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, could the 1700 be a carbonyl and the 1650 be an aromatic ring's C=C in conjugation, like in a ketone attached to a benzene ring. Or maybe an ester?

Looking at the NMR data: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to the H's on a double bond, like CH2=CH- groups. So the compound has a double bond, probably in a vinyl group. That might suggest an alkene somewhere in the structure.

Now, the Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. So what fragments have mass 45? Let me think about possible fragments. The common ones are: the methyl group (15), but that's not 45. Maybe a CO group? CO is 28, but that's not 45. Alternatively, a fragment like (CH3)2O would be 45 (since CH3 is 15 *2 + O is 16, so 2*15=30 +16=46, no, wait, that's 46). Hmm. Or maybe a CH2O group? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2=CH-O- something? Or perhaps a ketone fragment.

Wait another approach: 45 is also the molecular weight for (CH3)2CHOH? No, wait, (CH3)2CHOH would be (2*15)+(12)+16 +1= 45? Wait, (CH3)2CHOH is (2*15 CH3) + (CHOH is 12+16+1=29) 30 +29=59. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone. Like, if the molecule has a (CH3)2CO group, that's (2*15) +12 +16= 30+12=42 +16=58. No, that's too high. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is CH2CH2O, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2=CHO- group. Let me calculate: CH2=CHO- would be (14 + 32) = 46? No, wait: CH2=CHO is (12 for C) * 3 (since two in CH2 and one in CHO) + (H: 4) + O (16). So 3*12=36 +4=40 +16=56. No, that's 56.

Wait, maybe it's a CH3CO group. That would be (12 + 3*1) for CH3 (15) and (12 + 16) for CO (28). So 15+28=43. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe a CH2CO group. That's (12*2) +2 +16= 24+2=26+16=42. Still not 45.

Hmm. Maybe it's a different approach. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and see which one could have a fragment of 45.

The options:

A) C6H1
