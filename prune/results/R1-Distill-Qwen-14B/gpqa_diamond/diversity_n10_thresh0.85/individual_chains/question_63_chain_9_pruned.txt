Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Okay, the question says it's about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

First, I should recall what the fundamental state means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next higher energy state. But wait, what's the next state? I think in the rotation-vibration model, the next state could involve either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state. Oh wait, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, that probably means the lowest energy transition, so perhaps the minimal energy photon that can cause a transition. That would likely be a vibrational transition with the quantum number change.

Wait, no, wait. The non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right, the rigid rotor model assumes a fixed bond length, but the non-rigid one allows for bond length changes, which is more accurate for vibrations. So, the molecule's energy levels include both rotational and vibrational contributions.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For the non-rigid rotor, I think the energy levels are different, but perhaps the problem simplifies to considering a rigid rotor. Or maybe the vibrational energy is the main factor here since the question mentions the vibration model.

Wait, the question says "quantum rotation-vibration model," so it's considering both rotation and vibration. But when it's in the fundamental state, I think that refers to the vibrational ground state. So, the molecule is in the lowest vibrational state, which is the ground state with n=0 (vibrational quantum number), and possibly J=0 for rotation.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to the next higher energy state. But the next state with the lowest energy could be the first vibrational excited state (n=1) while keeping J at the lowest possible, or perhaps a change in the rotational state while staying in the same vibrational state.

Wait, but if it's the next lowest
