Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the quantum rotation-vibration model of a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They give me the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model... I think that refers to the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So the molecule is in the state where both the vibrational and rotational energies are at their lowest levels.

The question is about absorbing a photon that causes a transition to the next lowest energy state. So I need to figure out what that transition is. Since it's the next lowest, I think it might be the first excited state. But which part changes—vibration or rotation?

In the non-rigid rotor model, the molecule's rotation is considered along with vibration. But for the fundamental state, the vibrational state is at n=0, and rotational state is l=0 (since the ground state is the lowest rotational energy as well). So the energy levels are quantized for both.

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a change in either the vibrational, rotational, or both states. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would probably be the next vibrational state, n=1, because increasing the vibrational quantum number would lead to a higher energy than increasing the rotational state.

Alternatively, the next state could be the next rotational state. But the vibrational energy is much larger than the rotational energy for typical diatomic molecules. So switching from n=0 to n=1 would require a photon with energy equal to the vibrational energy difference, which is usually higher than the rotational energy jumps. Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy—so maybe it's the smallest possible increase in energy.

Hmm, maybe the molecule is in the ground state (n=0, l=0), and the next state could be either n=0, l=1 (rotation) or n=1, l=0 (vibration). Which one has lower energy?

Wait, let's calculate both possible energy differences and see which is smaller. The photon's energy would have to match the required energy change.

First, let's compute the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the difference between n=0 and n=1 is h*w. So E_vib change is h*w.

For the rotational energy levels, the formula is E_rot = (l(l + 1) ) * (ħ²)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for the diatomic is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So the energy difference for rotation when l increases from 0 to 1 would be E_rot = [1(1+1) - 0(0
