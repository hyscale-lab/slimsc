Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ? Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with something else. Oh, no, wait, I think it's ħ over two, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor. Hmm.

So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the less precisely we can know its energy. Because a shorter Δt implies a larger uncertainty ΔE, right? So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait no, wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. But we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1, let's say ΔE = E2 - E1. We need this ΔE to be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Hmm, but how exactly do the lifetimes relate to the energy uncertainty? Oh, right! The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt) of the state. So for each state, ΔE = ħ / (Δt). But which Δt do we use here? Wait, the two states have different lifetimes. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Because each state's energy is uncertain by its own ΔE. So the minimum ΔE required for them to be distinguishable would be when ΔE is greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Or wait, maybe the maximum uncertainty is the larger of the two. Let me think.

Wait, let me get the formula straight. For a single state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime of the state. So for the first state, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and for the second, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

So τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds. So τ1 is smaller than τ2 by a factor of 10. Therefore, ΔE1 would be larger than ΔE2 because the denominator is smaller, so the value is bigger.

Wait, let me compute the values. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2π), around 1.055e-34 J·s.

So for the first state:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J.

Wait, but we need this in eV. Oh, right, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 = 1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.586e-7 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1.055e-25 / 1.602e-19 = (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.658 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. So like 0.658 µeV.

Similarly, for τ2 =1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.055e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 6.586e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainty in E1 is larger. So when considering the energy difference, to distinguish E2 and E1, the ΔE between them should be at least larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger uncertainty?

Wait, I think the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties, which would be ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties, then you can resolve the two levels.

Wait, but which uncertainty is larger? ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So the sum would be about 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be greater than 7.24e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

But looking at the options, the choices are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, and 1e-8 eV.

Wait, none of the options is close to 1e-7 or 1e-6 eV. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the uncertainty principle applied in a different way. Maybe the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for the system. Wait, but each state has different lifetimes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider the product of the energy difference and the time of measurement. Or perhaps the time used in the uncertainty principle is the time during which the measurement is made. Or maybe the time is the time it takes for the state to decay.

Alternatively, perhaps the time is the same for both measurements, and we want the product ΔE * τ > ħ, where τ is the time resolution of the experiment. But I'm not quite sure.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels can be resolved if the energy difference is significantly larger than the uncertainty in energy. The uncertainty in energy for each state is determined by their lifetimes.

So for each state, the uncertainty is ΔE = ħ / τ.

The energy difference must be larger than the sum of these two uncertainties to ensure they can be distinguished. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the lines would overlap.

So let me compute the sum. As before, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. Sum is 7.24e-7 eV.

But the options are all way smaller than that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of one of the states, not the sum. Because each state's energy is uncertain by its own ΔE.

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 would be E2 - E1. For this to be distinguishable, the difference should be bigger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Because if it's smaller than either, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, let me think of it another way. Imagine two lines on a spectrum. If the lines are too close together (small ΔE), the measurement can't tell them apart. The minimum ΔE that can be resolved is determined by the instrument's resolution, which is tied to the uncertainties in the measurement.

In this case, the instrument's time resolution is the lifetime of each state, which defines the energy uncertainty for each. So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties.

But earlier calculations gave the sum as about 7e-7 eV, but none of the options are close. So perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ. Let me recheck that.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34) / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.658 * 1e-6 eV = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ (1.0545718 / 1.602176634) * 1e-7 ≈ 0.658 * 1e-7 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So the sum is about 7.24e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be at least, say, 7.24e-7 eV to be resolved.

Looking back at the options, the highest option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4. That's 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is way bigger than 7e-7. So option C is much larger than the required sum. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, it's much larger than the sum of the uncertainties, so it's definitely resolvable.

But wait, the options don't have something around 1e-6 or 1e-7. So perhaps I made a miscalculation, or perhaps the question is considering something else.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement, which is the larger of the two. Because the first state has a much larger uncertainty. So perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than ΔE1, which is 6.58e-7 eV.

But option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than that.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the sum, but just the maximum of the two. Because if E2 has an uncertainty of 6.58e-8 eV and E1 has 6.58e-7, then the main uncertainty comes from E1. So the energy difference must be at least larger than ΔE1. Because if ΔE is larger than ΔE1, then E2 would be distinguishable from E1.

Wait, but if the energy difference is larger than ΔE1, then E2 would be above E1's uncertainty. Let me think. Suppose E2 is E1 + ΔE. Then, the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, and in E2 is ΔE2. So the separation between E2 and E1 is ΔE. To distinguish, ΔE should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but perhaps in this case, the energy difference needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because the larger uncertainty is from τ1 (1e-9 s), which is 6.58e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 ≈ 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 100e-6, which is larger than 6.58e-7 (≈0.658e-6). So this would suffice.

But the other options: A is 1e-9, which is way smaller than 6.58e-7. B is 1e-11, also way too small. D is 1e-8, which is smaller than 6.58e-7. So the only option that's bigger than 6.58e-7 is C, which is 1e-4.

Wait, but wait, 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 100e-6 eV. The required minimum is 0.658e-6 eV. So C is much bigger, so that works.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C) 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, and \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (lifetime of the state). For each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we calculate the uncertainties in energy for both states.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \)
Using \( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference for distinguishability
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in energy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
The energy difference must be greater than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is much less than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small for the same reason.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** Sufficiently large, as \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \gg 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is less than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
