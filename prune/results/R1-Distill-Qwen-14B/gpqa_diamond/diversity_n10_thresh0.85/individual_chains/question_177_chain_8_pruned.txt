Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if their peak wavelengths are the same, then T1 = T2.

Wait, but the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies. So, right, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity. Luminosity L is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh, but since we're comparing two stars, the constants like 4π and σ will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 should be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, that's just (R1²)/(R2²) times (T1⁴/T2⁴) which is (R1/R2)². Because T1 = T2, their ratio is 1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same. So if T1 = T2, then their temperatures are equal. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1 = T2, (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that's option A, which is ~2.25.

But wait, the question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect luminosity? Oh, wait, luminosity as seen by an observer is affected by Doppler shifting. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelengths change, which affects the observed flux.

Wait, but in the question, the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, maybe the Doppler shift has to be considered. Because if Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelengths are Doppler shifted, so the observed peak wavelength might not be the same as the emitted. But the question states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. Hmm, so perhaps the Doppler shifts cause the observed lambda_max to be same for both stars.

Wait, let me think. So, the intrinsic (rest frame) lambda_max is determined by Wien's law based on their temperatures. But if a star is moving, the observed lambda_max would be different due to the Doppler effect.

So, for Star_1, if it's not moving (radial velocity 0), its observed lambda_max is the same as its emitted lambda_max. But Star_2 is moving
