Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopic data. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, right.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably from O-H or N-H stretching. But then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, and in IR, that usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be aromatic C=C stretches, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, 1H), which makes me think of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, which can be around 10-12 ppm. The broadness suggests it's exchanging, like in a carboxylic acid. Hmm, so maybe there's a COOH group.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. Like, if you have two substituents opposite each other, each with two protons. So the aromatic ring might have substituents in the para positions. The integration is 2H for each, so maybe two substituents each with a pair of protons, but wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is at the para position, but the protons on the ring would be split depending on substituents.

Wait, the 8.0 ppm is a doublet (d), which suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. In para substitution, each proton would be meta to the substituent. Wait, maybe the substituent is -COOH. Let's think: if the benzene has a COOH group in one position and another substituent in the para position. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group attached, like an ester or a ketone.

But wait, the IR has 1720 which could be a carbonyl. Let's consider if it's a benzoic acid derivative. Benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which would show up in IR as a broad peak around 2500-3000 (from O-H stretch) and a strong peak around 1700 for the C=O. But wait, the IR data given has 3400–2500, which is a broad region, maybe that's from an O-H stretch. 1720 suggests maybe an ester, but benzoic acid has a carbonyl around 1700, but it's also a strong O-H stretch from the COOH. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the O-H might not be present.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is really high for an aldehyde. But if it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent in the para position.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Those are probably from an alkyl chain. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain, like a CH2CH2CH3. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) as
