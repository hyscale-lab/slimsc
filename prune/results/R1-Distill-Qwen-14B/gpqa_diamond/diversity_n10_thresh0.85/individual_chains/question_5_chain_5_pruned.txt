Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of an operator. The operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this often correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made.

Let me read the problem again. The components of P are given: P_x, P_y, P_z. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So that matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which I think is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P is given as a vector operator, and in this case, it's along a direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, but how does that translate into the operator? Oh right, any vector operator can be expressed in terms of its components. So for a direction n, which lies in the x-z plane, the direction would have components (nx, 0, nz). Because the y-component is zero since it's in the x-z plane.

So the operator P along n is the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero, so the P_y term doesn't come in.

So the operator we're looking at is (nx P_x + nz P_z) multiplied by ħ/2. So let me write that out. P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Now, the eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. So we're to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue. Let me denote the eigenvector as |ψ> such that P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Wait, no: wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so P |ψ> = (+ħ/2)|ψ>.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, where λ is the eigenvalue. In this case, λ is +ħ/2. So, since P = (ħ/2) [n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z], the equation becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Dividing both sides by ħ/2, we get (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix equation is [n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z] |ψ> = |ψ>.

Let me denote the
