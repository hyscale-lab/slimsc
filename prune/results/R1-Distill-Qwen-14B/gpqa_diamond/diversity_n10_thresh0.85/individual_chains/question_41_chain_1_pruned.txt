Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. So, the setup is that there's a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but this is about a medium moving through the lab frame. So light's speed in the medium is affected by both the medium's motion and its refractive index.

Wait, wait. Normally, when a medium is stationary, light's speed is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium is moving. So I need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light.

I think this involves the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because light is moving in the same direction as the medium, so the velocities add, but in a relativistic way.

The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the medium's frame, and v is the medium's velocity relative to the lab. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh right, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)), but I'm a bit confused about the direction.

Wait, the light is moving at speed u in the medium's frame. The medium is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)). But wait, what is u here?

In the medium's frame, the speed of light is c/n. So u is c/n. So substituting in, the observed speed would be [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ].

Wait, let's compute that. Let's factor out c from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c/n) + v = c(1/n) + v = c (1/n + v/(c)) ? Hmm, not sure. Let me just keep it as (c/n + v).
