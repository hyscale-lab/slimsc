Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question is asking. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (H2O) to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Wait, what's going on here? Let me think. The first reaction, I think, is a nucleophilic substitution. Butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh wait, but NaCN is a source of CN-. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition followed by something else.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would probably do a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution unless under certain conditions. Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but in the product, we have a nitrile group. So maybe the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an addition product. But then, what happens next?

Wait, but in the product, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So it's a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group adjacent. Hmm, perhaps the mechanism involves first adding CN- to the ketone, then some kind of elimination or another reaction.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one (ketone) + NaCN. Oh wait, maybe it's a case of the formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group are added across the carbonyl carbon.

So the reaction would be: ketone + CN- (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form the cyanohydrin.

Wait, but for the formation of a cyanohydrin, I think you need an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then the CN- attacks, then another proton is involved, etc.

So in the first step, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in acidic conditions. So reagent A would be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B), or maybe something else, like H2SO4 or HCl. But looking at the options, the possible reagents are H3O+ (option A and B), or NaHSO3 (which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-), in options C and D.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a source of H+ because it's a salt of a weak acid (H2SO3). So if A is NaHSO3, that would provide H+ as well. So for the cyanohydrin formation, both H3O+ and NaHSO3 can act as acid catalysts. But wait, what else?

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a substitution. But butan-2-one is a ketone, which is not a good electrophile for SN2 unless in some specific conditions, which I don't think are present here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first reaction is a nucleophilic attack by CN- on the ketone, leading to the formation of an enol, which then tautomerizes or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw its structure. The carbon chain would be: the central carbon (originally from the ketone) has two CH3 groups, an OH, and a CN group. So it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait no, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. But butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When CN- adds, we get (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, maybe it's (CH2CN)(CH3)COH? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butane has four carbons. The nitrile is on C1, and the hydroxy and methyl are on C2.

Wait, but that's not possible since butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, butane is CH2CH2CH2CH3. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the nitrile on C1, and on C2, a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So structure is CH2(CN)(OH)(CH3)CH2? Wait no, that can't be. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so butanenitrile is four carbons in a row, with the nitrile on the first.

So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure:

CH2-C(CN)(OH)(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, no. Wait, butane has four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. But the nitrile is on the first carbon (butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN). So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have a hydroxyl and a methyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)(CN)-CH2-

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the nitrile is on the first carbon. Hmm, maybe my drawing is off. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, that's getting a bit confusing, but perhaps I should think about the reaction rather than the structure.

So, assuming that the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone carbonyl, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin, which would then have both the OH and CN groups on the same carbon as the original carbonyl.

But for that, the conditions would typically involve an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (protonating the carbonyl oxygen), making the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

So for the first reaction, A would be H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

So the first step, reagent A is H3O+.

Then, the second reaction is the conversion of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Because the product is a carboxylic acid.

How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? Typically, you can hydrolyze the nitrile under acidic or basic conditions, with heat.

In the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, but more likely, the reagent is an acid or a base. Wait, looking at the options, the second reagent (B) is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, the reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile plus B (water) giving the corresponding acid. So the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid via hydrolysis.

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done under either acidic or basic conditions. But in the presence of water, perhaps with heat.

Wait, but looking at the given reagents for B, the options are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

In acidic conditions, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid and heat. Or, more commonly, it's done under basic conditions with strong base like NaOH, followed by acid work-up.

Wait, but in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH, which are both acids. So maybe the reaction is done under acidic conditions.

Wait, but for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, the typical conditions are either:

1. Using H2O and HCl (acidic conditions, maybe with heat).

OR

2. Using a base, like aqueous NaOH, followed by acidification.

In this case, the reagent B is H2O, but perhaps it's being used with an acid catalyst.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So the molecule is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when you hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the OH group may or may not affect the reaction.

Wait, but the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. That suggests that the nitrile group (-CN) at position 2 becomes a -COOH group, and the hydroxyl remains.

So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. So under acidic conditions, perhaps the reaction is H3O+ (if B is HCl, which provides H+).

Wait, but if B is HCl, then in the second reaction, HCl (B) is the reagent, along with H2O.

Wait, but hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions typically involves HCl, heat, and water. So the second reagent would be HCl (like option A or C for B).

Wait, looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl (option A and C), CH3COOH (option B and D), or H3O+ (but B is H2O in those cases? Wait, the options have for B: for option A, B is HCl; for option B, B is CH3COOH; option C, B is HCl; D, B is CH3COOH.

So for the second reaction, in the presence of H2O, B is the reagent. So if B is HCl, it's providing H+ and Cl- ions. So under acidic conditions, the nitrile could hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, that's a weak acid. Would that be enough? Well, sometimes weak acids can act as catalysts.

But for the nitrile to carboxylic acid, generally, I think it's more efficient to use strong acid conditions. So perhaps B is HCl (so options A and C). But let's think.

Wait, looking again, the second reaction: the reagent B is in the presence of H2O. So the reaction is hydrolysis.

So if B is HCl, that would be an acidic condition. So the reaction would proceed as nitrile + H2O and HCl → carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, that's a milder acid, but perhaps sufficient.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which is a stronger acid than CH3COOH. So how is that formed? Because the reaction is probably done under conditions that favor the formation of the acid.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Another consideration is the role of the hydroxyl group in the molecule. Since the molecule already has a hydroxyl group, perhaps the reaction conditions should not involve strong bases, as that might deprotonate the hydroxyl.

Wait, but if the reaction is acidic, the OH group would be protonated, making it a better leaving group. Hmm, but wait, the OH group is on the same carbon as the nitrile. If the nitrile is on C2, and the OH is also on C2, perhaps this is a hindered environment.

Wait, maybe the presence of the hydroxyl group affects the hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps it's a matter of the reaction conditions.

Wait, thinking about the first reaction again. If A is H3O+, that's a strong acid, so that would make sense for the cyanohydrin formation.

Then, for the second reaction, if B is HCl, that's a strong acid, which would hydrolyze the nitrile to the acid.

So looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl. Option C is A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

So which one is correct?

Wait, NaHSO3 would provide H+ ions as well. So perhaps either H3O+ or NaHSO3 could be used as the acid catalyst for the first reaction. But wait, the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which typically uses a strong acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid. Wait, HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+. So maybe using H3O+ is better for the first reaction, as it's a stronger acid.

So if A is H3O+ (options A and B), and B is HCl (options A and C), then the correct option would have A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, why would NaHSO3 be used? NaHSO3 is often used as a source of H+ and SO3^2- in certain reactions, like in the hydrolysis of nitriles or in the workup of certain reactions. Alternatively, perhaps for the first reaction, if NaHSO3 is used, but does it provide enough acidity?

Wait, but the cyanohydrin formation generally requires an acid catalyst. H3O+ is a strong acid, so it's likely the right choice for A.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so options A and B are possible), and for the second reaction, B is HCl (so options A and C are possible).

Thus, the correct combination would be A is H3O+ and B is HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. If the second reagent is HCl and H2O, would that be sufficient to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid? Because HCl in water is a strong acid and can provide the H+ needed. So that's a plausible scenario.

Alternatively, if B were CH3COOH, would that work? I think CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it might not be strong enough for the hydrolysis, which usually requires higher temperatures and strong acid conditions.

So in that case, option A is correct: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions for the reaction. NaHSO₃, while capable of providing H⁺, is generally less effective for this reaction compared to H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This reaction typically requires acidic or basic conditions, often with heat. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction likely proceeds under acidic conditions. HCl, a strong acid, is well-suited for this hydrolysis, as it provides the necessary H⁺ ions to facilitate the reaction. CH₃COOH, being a weak acid, is less likely to be effective for this transformation under the given conditions.

Considering the options, the combination of A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl is the most appropriate choice for the two reactions. H₃O⁺ ensures efficient cyanohydrin formation in the first step, and HCl provides the strong acidic conditions needed for nitrile hydrolysis in the second step.
