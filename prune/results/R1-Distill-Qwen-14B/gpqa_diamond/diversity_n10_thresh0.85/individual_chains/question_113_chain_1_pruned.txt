Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's see, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The data given includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Hmm, I should take it step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR results. The broad absorption around 3000 cm-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups, probably from alcohols, phenols, or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, I remember that a broad peak around there is typical for O-H stretching in either alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 peak is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl but maybe conjugated, like in an aromatic ring or maybe an amide? Wait, but if it's another C=O, that might not fit. Alternatively, could it be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with some electron-withdrawing groups nearby, or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents?

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a typical carbonyl stretch. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps an ester group. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a double bond, like an alkene. Because vinyl hydrogens are mentioned in the NMR, so there's an alkene somewhere. So, maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretch in the molecule. So, two carbonyls? Or one and a C=C?

Wait, maybe the 1700 is from a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester, and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring, but the problem doesn't mention anything about aromatic protons in the NMR, so perhaps it's an aliphatic double bond.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, typically appearing as a multiplet around 4.5-6.5 ppm, depending on the substitution. So, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene is present.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what's a common fragment at 45? I remember that the CH3CO+ ion (acetate) is 45. Or maybe (CH3)2COH+? Wait, acetate is 45. So, if that's the case, then maybe the molecule has an ester group, because the acetate is a common fragment in esters when the molecule breaks down.

Putting this all together, the compound likely has an ester group (since we have a C=O and possibly a CH3CO group). Also, the O-H from the FTIR suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if there's an ester, then the O-H could come from a carboxylic acid, which would have a broad O-H peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the FTIR shows a broad O-H peak, which could be a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the O-H is very broad and strong, around 2500-3300 cm-1. But the problem says the peak is at 3000. Could that be a carboxylic acid? Or maybe an alcohol. Hmm.

But if the compound has both a carbonyl and an O-H, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, would that fit the other data? Let's think: a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl (around 1700) and an O-H (broad). Also, a carboxylic acid would have an -OH group. But then what about the mass spectrum?

Wait, the fragment at 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion, which would come from an ester, maybe. For example, if the molecule is an ester, like an acetate, then it could lose some groups and leave the CH3CO+ fragment.

So, putting this together: the compound has a carbonyl (ester group perhaps), an O-H group (maybe from a carboxylic acid or from an alcohol), and an alkene (from the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR). Let's think about the possible structures.

Wait, if the compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group, like a hemiacetal? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-ester? Or maybe a beta-keto ester? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But then, would that have an O-H? Probably not, unless it's an opened lactone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an ester group and an alcohol. Hmm, but that would complicate the formula.

Wait, let's look at the molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, four options. Let's think about the possible functional groups and how they affect the formula.

If the compound has a carbonyl group (C=O), like an ester, that would require an O. Also, the ester group is O-C-O, so that's two oxygens. Wait, no, the ester functional group is R-O-C-O-R. So, each ester group adds two oxygens. Oh wait, no. Let me think: the formula for an ester is RCOOR', so the formula is CnH2nO2. So, for each ester, two oxygens.

Wait, the options are C6H12O2, which would have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, two oxygens. How many degrees of unsaturation does that have?

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0, N=0.

So for C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one degree of unsaturation. Which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, if we have a carbonyl group (which is a double bond), then the remaining is perhaps a ring or another double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond (so that's one degree). So, if the compound has a double bond and maybe a ring, or another double bond.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1650, which could be a conjugated double bond, like an alkene.

So, let's think about the possible structures.

If the compound is an ester with a double bond and an O-H group, what would that look like? For example, maybe a substituted acrylic acid ester, like something like CH2CHCOOR. But perhaps more specific.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula. Let's take each option and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring. But wait, we have a vinyl group (so that's one double bond), but the IR also shows a carbonyl (another double bond), so that would require two degrees. Hmm, so this formula may not fit because the degrees of unsaturation would be 2 (one from C=O, one from C=C).

Wait, wait, no. Wait the formula for degrees is (2C+2 - H - X + N)/2.

A: C6H12O2.

So 2*6=12 +2=14. 14 -12 (H) =2. 2/2=1. So one degree. But if there's a C=O (1) and a C=C (another), that's two. So the formula needs to account for that. So A has 1 degree, but we have two double bonds. So that can't be possible. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the O's affect the calculation. No, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. O doesn't affect it. So for C6H12O2:

(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring.

But FTIR shows a C=O and a C=C, which are two double bonds. So that would require two degrees of unsaturation, which the formula doesn't have. So that can't be the case. So option A is out? Because the molecular formula doesn't account for two double bonds.

Wait, unless one of the double bonds is part of a ring. Like, if the molecule is cyclic with one ring (so that's one degree) and a double bond (another degree). So the formula would have two degrees of unsaturation. But the formula for option A is C6H12O2, which only allows one. So that can't be. So maybe option A is incorrect.

Hmm, moving on. Option B is C6H10O. Degrees: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond (which is two). So possible.

But the compound from the data has a C=O and a C=C, that's two double bonds. So this formula would fit, as it allows two degrees.

But wait, the IR also shows a broad O-H, which suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The formula for option B is C6H10O. So for an alcohol, the formula would be CnH2n+1OH. Wait, for n=6, that would be C6H13O. But option B is C6H10O, which is two hydrogens less. So that doesn't fit an alcohol. Unless it's a cyclic structure or something else.

Alternatively, if it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that might not fit. Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If the compound has a C=O (ester or ketone) and a C=C (vinyl), that's two degrees. So that's possible.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees: (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. So perhaps a ring or a double bond. But again, if the data shows two double bonds (C=O and C=C), this formula wouldn't fit.

So, options B and C could be possible. Let me think about the IR again. The FTIR shows broad O-H. So, if the compound has an ester group (so two O's) and a hydroxyl group (another O), but wait, no, that would require three O's. Wait, no. Wait, the molecular formulas: option C has two O's, so that would mean both O's are in the ester, or perhaps an ester and a hydroxyl.

Wait, no, no. Because the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. So two O's. So if the compound has both a carbonyl (O from the C=O) and a hydroxyl (another O), that would require three O's. Wait, but the compound only has two O's. So that can't be. So the O-H must come from an -OH group, but then the other O is from a carbonyl.

Wait, but that would require two O's: one for the carbonyl and one for the hydroxyl. So that matches option C, which has two O's. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid, but then the ester would require another O. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, alternative approach: let's think about the possible structures and see which match the data.

If the compound is a beta-keto ester, for example, that would have both a ketone (C=O) and an ester (another C=O). But that would require three O's, which isn't the case in any of the options except if C6H10O3 is an option, but it's not. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond and an -OH group. But then the O count would be three (from two C=O and an -OH), which again isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol, and the compound is an ester. So for example, a molecule with an ester group and an alcohol group. So that would require two O's: one for the ester (which has two O's in the group, but in the formula, it's accounted for in the O count). Wait, no. Let me think: an ester is R-O-CO-R', which has two O's in the ester group. So the formula would have O2. So if the molecule also has an -OH group, that would make three O's. But looking at the options, none of them have three O's except option C and A have two. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something else that doesn't add an additional O. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid. So in that case, the O's are accounted for as follows: the carboxylic acid has two O's (COOH), and if there's an ester group, that might add more O's. But again, the molecular formula doesn't have three O's except for maybe a different structure.

Wait, maybe the compound has an ester group and an alcohol. So the ester would contribute two O's, and the
