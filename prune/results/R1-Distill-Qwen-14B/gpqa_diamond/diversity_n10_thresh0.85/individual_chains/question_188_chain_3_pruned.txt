Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which I think is a type of hexagonal crystal system but with all sides equal and all angles equal. Oh right, a rhombohedron has all edges equal and all angles the same. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which I suppose is the lattice parameter 'a' since it's the edge length.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the angles can be either acute or obtuse, but I think the formula for interplanar spacing might still apply regardless.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is given by the formula d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) ) ), but wait, no, that's not right. I think I'm mixing things up. Oh, wait, in a general case, for a cubic system, it's d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But rhombohedral is more complex because the angles between the lattice vectors aren't 90 degrees.

Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles between them is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the dot product. Wait, more accurately, the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l² + k²/m² + l²/n²) ), but perhaps I need to think in terms of the metric tensor.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system where a = b = c (since all edges are equal), the formula for d_{hkl} is a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is one of the angles between the lattice vectors. Wait, because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so it's the same
