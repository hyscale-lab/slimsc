Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT must preserve those. 

Let me list the symmetries. The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincaré symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries, right? So if the SM includes Poincaré, then SMEFT must too because it's just an effective theory built from SM principles.

CP symmetry is another thing. I know that the SM doesn't always respect CP, like in the CKM matrix where CP violation occurs. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily need to preserve CP. Wait, but wait! SMEFT includes all operators, including those that violate CP. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry on their own. So the answer can't include option 3.

CPT symmetry—does the SM respect that? I think the SM is CPT symmetric. Because all the particles have their antiparticles, and the interactions preserve that. So any effective theory derived from SM must respect CPT as well. Therefore, SMEFT operators must preserve CPT symmetry.

Let me look at the options again. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which ones are mandatory?

Lorentz symmetry—definitely yes. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations, so yes. So 1 and 2 are in.

CP symmetry is not necessarily respected, as the operators can violate CP. So 3 is out.

CPT is a must, so 4 is in.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. But wait, option C is 1,2,4 and option D is 1,3,4.

Wait wait, did I get that right? The question is which must be respected by all operators. So Poincare is a combination of Lorentz and translations. So if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it's not
