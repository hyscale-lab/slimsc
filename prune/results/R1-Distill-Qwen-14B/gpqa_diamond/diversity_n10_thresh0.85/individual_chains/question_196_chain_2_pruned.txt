Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I think I remember harmonic oscillators from my mechanics class, but this one is relativistic, which probably means I need to consider special relativity effects.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The setup is a one-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct expression for v_max.

Wait, in a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA², and this gets converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m) because (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². That gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = (kA)/sqrt(m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The options have a C option that looks like this: sqrt(kA²/m). So C is the non-relativistic answer.

But this question is relativistic, so I can't use the same approach. Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, c. So I need to use relativistic energy conservation.

In special relativity, the total energy of the oscillator isn't just kinetic plus potential; it's the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, the harmonic oscillator's potential is a form of stored energy, so maybe I should think in terms of relativistic energy and momentum.

The total energy E of the oscillator at any point would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. But wait, the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator might be treated differently. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should model this similar to a particle in a potential well, but using relativistic mechanics.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this using the relativistic form of energy and momentum. Let's think: the total energy E is gamma mc², which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)k x², but in relativistic scenarios, sometimes potentials are treated differently. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the oscillator's equation of motion uses a relativistic correction, like a term involving velocity squared in the potential. But the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, so perhaps the potential is still (1/2)k x².

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, when the mass is at position x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, which is (1/2)mv². But in the relativistic case, energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy. So perhaps at x=0, the total energy is gamma mc², and the potential energy is zero (since x=0). Wait, no. Wait, the potential energy is a function of position, so when the mass is at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². But in that case, the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A² + mc²? Or is it that the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the total energy is (1/2)k A² plus rest energy?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)k A². At x=0, all of that is kinetic. But when you go relativistic, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and the total energy is gamma mc². So perhaps the total energy would then be (1/2)k A² plus mc²? Or maybe not. No, that doesn't seem right because in the non-relativistic case, at x=A, the KE is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)k A². So in the relativistic case, perhaps the same applies: the total energy is (1/2)k A² + mc²? Or wait, maybe not. Because the potential energy is (1/2)k x², so at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)k A².

But wait, that's the non-relativistic scenario. In reality, if the mass is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², but the rest energy is mc². So the total energy E would then be (1/2)k A² + mc². Then, when the mass is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², so the total energy is gamma mc². So equate the two: (1/2)k A² + mc² = gamma mc².

Wait, that makes sense. So at the maximum displacement x=A, all the energy is potential, so E = (1/2)k A² + mc². At x=0, all the energy is kinetic plus rest energy: E = gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So setting them equal:

(1/2)k A² + mc² = gamma mc²

Solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, let me write that again.

gamma = (mc² + (1/2)k A²
