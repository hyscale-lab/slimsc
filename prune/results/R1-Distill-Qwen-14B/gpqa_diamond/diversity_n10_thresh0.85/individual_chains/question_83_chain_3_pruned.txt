Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, I remember that titration involves neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form acetate ions and water, right?

First, I think I need to find out the concentrations after dilution. Oh right, because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, so the total volume is 40 cm³. 

The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, for the titration. The NaOH is 0.1 M. Let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 moles.

The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point, so for equivalence, it's when exactly 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but what about the 25% titration? That means 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

But wait, perhaps I should approach each part separately.

First, let's handle the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence can be calculated. Let me think. The moles of acetate would be 0.001 moles, and the total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (10 cm³), so 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze according to the equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH^- can be found using the Kb expression. Since Kb is very small, the change x will be small, so we can approximate.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02) = 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Taking square root gives x ≈ 3.289e-6 M. So [OH^-] ≈ 3.289e-6.

pOH is -log(3.289e-6) ≈ 5.48. pH is 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52. Hmm
