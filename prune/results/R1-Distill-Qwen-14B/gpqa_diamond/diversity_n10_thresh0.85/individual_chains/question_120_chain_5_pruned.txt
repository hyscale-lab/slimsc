Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about what I know about parallax and star distribution.

Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, which means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. I guess this is about how many stars you'd expect to find in a given range of parallax values. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, it's not about their actual density in space, but how their numbers project onto our observations.

Wait, I remember something about the distribution of stars based on their distances. The number of stars at a certain distance should depend on the volume of space at that distance. But how does that translate into parallax?

Let me think. The number of stars in a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dd is approximately the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², so the number of stars would be 4πd² * (number density) * dd.

But wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed, then the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a shell is proportional to d² * dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So d is 1/plx. Let's substitute that in. The number of stars in a shell at distance d would be proportional to (1/plx)^2 * (dd). Wait, but wait, I think I need to express everything in terms of parallax.

Alternatively, let's consider the change in parallax. Let's say we have a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx. Each parallax corresponds to a distance d = 1/plx.

So for a small change in plx, dplx, the corresponding change in distance dd is negative, because as plx increases, d decreases. Let me compute dd in terms of dplx.

We have d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when counting stars, we probably care about the magnitude, not the direction.
