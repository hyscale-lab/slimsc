Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres, and I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem states that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the excitation of atoms is described by the Boltzmann equation. The population of a specific energy level depends on the temperature and the energy difference between levels. The Boltzmann factor gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like N2/N1 = exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where N2 is the number in the higher energy level, N1 in the lower, E2 > E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, but which way around? Let me make sure. So, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, star_1 has more atoms in the upper energy level than star_2. Let me denote star_1 as N1 and star_2 as N2, but wait, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, maybe the fraction of atoms in that excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Or wait, perhaps the population of that specific level is twice. So, if level E is the excited state, then for star_1, N_E1 = 2 * N_E2, where N_E is the number of atoms in that level for each star.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Let me denote for each star, the population of the excited level as N1 and N2 for star_1 and star_2, respectively. The problem says N1 = 2 * N2.

But wait, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, N_high / N_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_high - E_low.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same energy levels, just different temperatures. So the ΔE is the same for both. So for each star, the ratio of populations is different because their temperatures are different.

But wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so the population of the higher energy level (excited state) in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, N1 (star_1's excited population) = 2 * N2 (star_2's excited population).

But wait, let's model this. Let’s say for each star, the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, N1_excited
