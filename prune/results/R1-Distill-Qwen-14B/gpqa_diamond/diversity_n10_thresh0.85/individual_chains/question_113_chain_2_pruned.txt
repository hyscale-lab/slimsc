Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The problem describes an unknown compound that's been characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine its chemical formula from the given options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Breaking down the data from each technique:

1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - Very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. That's typically an O-H stretch, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak around 3000 could also be N-H (amines), but the options don't have N, so probably O-H.
   - Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a conjugated ester. The 1650 is a bit lower, which might indicate conjugation or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum:**
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule has a double bond somewhere. Also, considering the presence of these hydrogens, the structure probably isn't fully conjugated with all double bonds, but maybe an isolated double bond or part of a ring.

3. **Mass Spectrometry:**
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, what fragments give m/z 45? Common ones include C3H7 (which is 53, so no), maybe a carbonyl group losing some parts. Wait, 45 is the same as (CH3)2O, which is 45. Because (12+1*2) + (16) = 45. So that's a fragment that includes an ether group or perhaps a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe a CO group losing some atoms, but CO is 28. Wait, maybe it's the loss of a larger fragment.

Wait, let me think about common fragments. The m/z 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but I don't think that's relevant here. Another possibility is a fragment where a CH3 group is attached to an O, as in (CH3)2O would be 45. Or it's the loss of something else. Wait, maybe it's a ketene ion (like O=C=O), but that's 44. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH3CO+ (which is 43). So 45 is more likely (CH3)2O, so maybe an ether group is present.

Now, putting this all together.

First, the FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 is likely an O-H group, so the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, FTIR of a carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and appears around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, but the 1700 cm⁻¹ in this case—could that be the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid? Carboxylic acids have O-H (broad) and C=O (around 1700). So maybe.

But then the 1650 cm⁻¹ could be another carbonyl, but that's lower than 1700. Wait, if the compound is an ester, then the carbonyl would be around 1730-1750. Alternatively, conjugated carbonyls (like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester) might absorb lower. So maybe the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and the 1650 is some other conjugated group, like a conjugated double bond. Wait, but alkenes (C=C) don't have strong absorptions that high. Oh, wait, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents. Aromatic C-H stretching is around 3000, but the peaks in FTIR here are at 1700 and 1650. Another possibility is that the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. For example, in an enone system, the C=O might be around 1700 and the conjugated C=C might have a peak around 1650 due to conjugation.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So perhaps the structure is something like an ester with a double bond nearby.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

Let me think about degrees of unsaturation for each option, which might help.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, so DoU = (2C +2 - H)/2.

Calculating each:

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So DoU would need at least one double bond. So if DoU is 1, it's either a ring or a double bond. But the compound also has an O-H (from FTIR), perhaps.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a ring and a double bond or two double bonds or a ring and a carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU=(12+2-10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU=(12+2 -12)/2= 2/2=1.

So options A and D have 1 DoU, B and C have 2. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So all options have at least one DoU in their structure, except perhaps if they have a ring and a double bond.

Wait, wait: If the compound has both a ring and a double bond, that takes two DoU. So for example, benzene (a ring) plus a double bond (like in styrene) would be two DoU. So if any of the options have structures with two DoU, that's possible.

Looking at the options:

If the compound is an ester, like methyl something, perhaps with a double bond.

Wait, the mass spec peak at m/z 45: possible fragments could be (CH3)2O (
