Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativistic mechanics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question is about the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. So, in the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't just use the regular kinetic energy formula anymore. Oh right, in relativity, the energy is given by the total energy equation which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

The setup is: mass m, maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. So, the potential energy in the spring is (1/2)kx². In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all potential energy is converted into kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is about the relativistic case, so I shouldn't stop here.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; we also have the rest energy mc². So the total energy E of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, no. Wait, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². So when the mass is at the maximum displacement, all its energy is potential. As it moves towards equilibrium, this potential converts into kinetic energy.

So, the total mechanical energy (which is conserved) would be the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy at any point. But wait, in relativity, energy isn't conserved in the same way. Or is it? Well, in this case, since there's no dissipation, mechanical energy is still conserved, but the kinetic energy is relativistic, meaning it's given by (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, no, actually, the total energy E is gamma * mc², which includes the kinetic energy. So when the mass is at maximum displacement, all the energy is the potential energy of the spring. But wait, the spring's potential energy is (1/2)kA². So at maximum displacement, the total energy is (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy (mc²). Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, we only consider the kinetic and potential energies, not the rest mass energy, because the rest energy is constant. So maybe in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is moving, the total energy is rest energy plus kinetic, but the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of energy conservation. At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the mass has maximum kinetic energy. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So the total mechanical energy (including rest mass) would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy at that point. But wait, the mechanical energy usually refers to the sum of kinetic and potential. Hmm, but in relativity, the potential energy is part of the system's energy, so the total energy should include the rest energy and the mechanical energy.

Wait, maybe I should model the total energy as including both the spring's potential and the relativistic kinetic.

So, when the mass is at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy mc². Wait, no. Because in non-relativistic cases, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the maximum kinetic energy. But in the relativistic case, the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, but wait, when x is A, kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy would just be the rest energy plus the potential energy of the spring.

Wait, no, because the potential energy is part of the system's energy. So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical (kinetic + potential) energy.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write down the energy conservation equation. At the point of maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc² = 0 (since v=0, gamma is 1). So the total energy is just the rest energy plus the potential energy. But wait, in relativity, the potential energy is part of the system's energy, so the total energy E would be the rest energy plus the potential energy of the spring.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the spring's potential isn't part of the rest energy. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the system's total energy (including rest mass energy) at any time should be conserved. So when the mass is at x = A, its velocity is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc² = 0, since v=0. So the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But when the mass is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So E = (gamma) mc², since (gamma) mc² = K + mc². Wait, that doesn't add up. Because K is (gamma - 1) mc², so E = K + rest energy = (gamma -1) mc² + mc² = gamma mc². So the total energy is gamma mc².

Wait, but when the mass is at x=A, E is (1/2)kA² + mc². Because at x=A, the KE is zero, so the total energy is rest plus potential. So, at x=0, E is gamma mc². Therefore:

(1/2)kA² + mc² = gamma mc².

So solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but wait, let's write that correctly. Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA². So at x=0, the energy is all kinetic, which is (gamma -1) mc². So we have:

mc² + (1/2)kA² = (gamma) mc².

Wait, no, because the total energy at x=A is mc² (rest energy) plus (1/2)kA² (spring potential). So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the mass has maximum speed, so all energy is kinetic. So the total energy is also (gamma) mc², where gamma is based on the speed at x=0.

Therefore:

mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Hmm, solving for v. Let me rearrange this equation.

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as a term, say, let's call it alpha for simplicity. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Taking reciprocal on both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Factor the right-hand side,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding the numerator,

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha²) - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator,

= alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But let's see, alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). If the spring constant k is such that alpha is small (non-relativistic case), then (1 + alpha)^2 ≈ 1 + 2 alpha, and perhaps we can approximate, but in this problem, we're looking for the general case.

Wait, perhaps I can write:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Which can be written as,

v² = c² [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Which is,

v² = c² [ (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1) ]/(1 + alpha)^2.

Simplify numerator: 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v² = c² (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor alpha in numerator,

v² = c² alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of gamma.

Wait, another approach: What's the maximum speed? It's when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but in relativistic terms.

Wait, but maybe the potential energy is (1/2)kA² and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (gamma - 1) mc². So equate these:

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + alpha.

Same as before. So,

gamma = 1 + alpha,

and,

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1 + alpha.

Solve for v/c:

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - (v/c)^2) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - (v/c)^2 = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which gives,

(v/c)^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, same as before. So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ).

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Expand denominator:

1/(1 + alpha)^2 = 1/(
