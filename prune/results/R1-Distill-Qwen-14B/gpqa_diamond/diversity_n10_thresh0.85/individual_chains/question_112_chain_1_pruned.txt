Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to parse it out step by step. Alright, the question is about an electron state and finding probabilities and an average value of an operator. 

First, let me read the problem again. The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So they form an orthonormal basis. 

Wait, but the state is given as proportional, so I probably need to normalize it. Because in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized to 1.

So the first step is to write |alpha> as a linear combination. Let me denote the coefficients. The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), and for |down> is (2-i). So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but since it's proportional, we'll have to normalize it.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself. 

Let me compute that. The inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i). Wait, because when you take the conjugate transpose, the coefficients get conjugated. So |alpha><alpha| would be:

(1+i)(1-i) |up><up| + (1+i)(2+i) |up><down| + (2-i)(1-i)|down><up| + (2-i)(2+i)|down><down|.

Wait, but the inner product is just the sum of the magnitudes squared of each coefficient. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

So the inner product is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Let me compute each modulus squared.

|1 + i| squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because the modulus of a complex number a+bi is sqrt(a^2 + b^2), so squared is a^2 + b^2.

Similarly, |2 - i| squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, sqrt(7) is the denominator because the norm is sqrt(7), so |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the problem also mentions another operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So what's the matrix of this operator? Since it's a 2x2 matrix (since it's for spin-1/2 particles), the basis is |up> and |down>.

Let me index the matrix as rows and columns 1 and 2, where row 1 is |up>, row 2 is |down>.

So for A_ij:
