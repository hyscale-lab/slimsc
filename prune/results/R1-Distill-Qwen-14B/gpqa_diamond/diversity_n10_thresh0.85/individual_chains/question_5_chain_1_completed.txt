Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied to them, so the operator P acting on the eigenvector gives (ħ/2) multiplied by the eigenvector.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these has a matrix form multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, these components often form a vector operator.

So, the operator P is the vector sum of its components, right? So the operator in the direction n would be P · n, where n is a unit vector. Since n is in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) ? Wait, wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would mean that the angle φ is zero, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no, actually, the x-z plane is where the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), maybe? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So if n is in the x-z plane, φ would be 0, so cosφ is 1, sinφ is 0. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) ? Or perhaps (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. When θ is 0, the direction is along the z-axis, so x=0, z=1. So the components would be (x, y, z) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is measured from the z-axis. Yeah, that sounds right.

Wait, no, that's the usual convention. θ is the angle from the z-axis, so position vector (r) would be (r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ). But since n is a unit vector, r is 1. So n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Oh right, because when φ is 0, it's along x, and when φ is 90 degrees, it's along y, but in our case, the direction is in x-z plane, so φ=0, so n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So any direction in the x-z plane can be represented with φ=0, varying θ.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so that would be any θ, but φ is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), a unit vector.

So the operator P in direction n is P · n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because P is a vector operator, so the operator in direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So direction cosines are the components of the unit vector, which are (sinθ, 0, cosθ) since n is in x-z.

So the operator P_n = P · n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But the question says to find the normalized eigenvector, so I need to solve for |ψ> such that P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the spin operator in an arbitrary direction. Because I remember that for spin-½ particles, the eigenstates of S · n are spin-up and spin-down along n, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator P in the problem is given as a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. From the definitions, each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a Pauli matrix. Let me see:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, that's the standard form for the Pauli matrices. So each component of P is (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. So the operator P is (ħ/2) times the vector of Pauli matrices.

So the operator in direction n is (ħ/2) (σ · n) = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since our n is in x-z plane, n_y=0, so it's (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

So the matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z. So the matrix becomes [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Multiply by ħ/2.

So P_n is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Given that n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

The eigenvalues of P_n are ± ħ/2, because the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, they become ± ħ/2.

Wait, so for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, what's the eigenvector?

I remember that the eigenvectors for a spin-½ system in direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states. The spin-up state in direction n can be written as a combination of the spin-up and spin-down states in the z-direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I can construct the matrix and find its eigenvectors.

Let me write down the matrix for P_n.

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, no, because σ · n is n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z, so the matrix is:

[ n_z, n_x ]
[ n_x, -n_z ]

So P_n is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

So the matrix for P_n is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

We can write this as:

[[ (ħ/2) n_z, (ħ/2) n_x ],
 [ (ħ/2) n_x, -(ħ/2) n_z ] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So subtracting (ħ/2) from the diagonal elements:

P_n - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when we subtract (ħ/2) I, it's:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] - (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,1]] 

Which equals (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ (n_z -1) (ħ/2), n_x (ħ/2) ]
[ n_x (ħ/2), (-n_z -1)(ħ/2) ]

To find the eigenvectors, this matrix must be singular, so the determinant should be zero.

Wait, but perhaps instead of dealing with this, I can construct the eigen equation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. The eigenvectors of σ · n are the same as those of the spin operator, which can be written in terms of the spherical harmonics or using Euler angles.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to represent the eigenvector in terms of the components. Let's represent the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b], and it needs to satisfy (P_n - (ħ/2) I) [a; b] = 0.

So, let's plug in the matrix:

[ (ħ/2)(n_z) - (ħ/2) )    (ħ/2) n_x          ] [a]   [0]
[ (ħ/2) n_x         (ħ/2)(-n_z) - (ħ/2) ] [b] = [0]

Simplify each element:

Top row: (ħ/2)(n_z -1) * a + (ħ/2) n_x * b = 0
Bottom row: (ħ/2) n_x * a + (ħ/2)(-n_z -1) * b = 0

We can factor out (ħ/2) from each term, so the equations become:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

These are two equations. Let's write them:

1) (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

We can solve this system for a and b. Let's take equation 1:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b
=> a = [-n_x / (n_z -1)] b

But substituting this into equation 2,

n_x * [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0
=> [ -n_x² / (n_z -1) ] b + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) to eliminate denominator:

- n_x² b + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ -n_x² + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) ] b = 0

Since b can't be zero (as then a would be zero too, trivial solution), the bracket must be zero.

So,

- n_x² + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) = 0

Let me expand (-n_z -1)(n_z -1):

= (-n_z)(n_z) + (-n_z)(-1) + (-1)(n_z) + (-1)(-1)
= -n_z^2 + n_z - n_z + 1
= -n_z^2 + 0 + 1
= 1 - n_z^2

So the equation becomes:

- n_x^2 + (1 - n_z^2) = 0
=> n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 

Which makes sense because n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So this doesn't give any new information, which means the two equations are dependent, and we can choose a non-trivial solution by setting one variable in terms of the other.

So from equation 1:

a = [-n_x / (n_z -1)] b

Let me write it as a = [n_x / (1 - n_z)] b

Let me choose b = 1 (for simplicity), then a = n_x/(1 - n_z)

But wait, what if 1 - n_z is zero? That would happen when n_z =1, which is along the +z direction. Then, in that case, equation 1 becomes (1-1) a + n_x b = 0 → 0 + n_x b =0. So if n_x is zero, then it's okay, but in that case, n is along z. Hmm, perhaps I should avoid that case for now.

But for the general case where n_z ≠ 1, proceed.

So the eigenvector would be [ a; b ] = [ n_x/(1 - n_z) , 1 ]

But we need to normalize this vector. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So |a|^2 = (n_x^2)/(1 - n_z)^2 + 1

Wait, but since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2. So substitute:

|a|^2 = (1 - n_z^2)/(1 - n_z)^2 + 1 = ( (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) )/ (1 - n_z)^2 ) + 1

Simplify numerator: (1 - n_z)(1 + n_z) = (1 - n_z^2)

So it's (1 - n_z^2)/(1 - n_z)^2 = (1 + n_z)/(1 - n_z)

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (1 + n_z)/(1 - n_z) + 1 = [ (1 + n_z) + (1 - n_z) ] / (1 - n_z) ) 

= [2 ] / (1 - n_z )

So the normalization factor is sqrt( (1 + n_z)/(1 - n_z) + 1 ) ), but wait, the denominator in |a|^2 is (1 - n_z)^2, so I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, no. Let's re-calculate normalization.

The vector is [a, b]^T = [n_x/(1 - n_z), 1]^T.

So |a|^2 is (n_x^2)/(1 - n_z)^2 

|b|^2 is 1^2 =1 

So the sum is (n_x^2)/(1 - n_z)^2 + 1

But since n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2,

=> (1 - n_z^2)/(1 -n_z)^2 +1 

= ( (1 -n_z)(1+ n_z) )/(1 -n_z)^2 ) + 1 

= (1 + n_z)/(1 -n_z) +1 

= [ (1 + n_z) + (1 -n_z) ]/(1 -n_z) )

= [2 ]/(1 -n_z )

Hmm, so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt( 2/(1 -n_z) ) ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Wait, but wait, 2/(1-n_z) is under the square root. So the norm is sqrt( 2/(1-n_z) ), so the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( 2/(1-n_z) ) ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (n_x/(1 -n_z)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Simplify the first component:

n_x/(1-n_z) * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 ) = n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z) ) / sqrt( 2 (1-n_z)^2 ) )

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to write it as:

a = [ n_x/(1-n_z) ] * normalization factor.

Wait, let me compute normalization factor N:

N = 1 / sqrt( (n_x^2)/(1-n_z)^2 + 1 )

But n_x^2 = 1 -n_z^2,

So N = 1/ sqrt( (1 -n_z^2)/(1-n_z)^2 + 1 )

= 1/sqrt( (1 +n_z)/(1-n_z) +1 )

= 1/sqrt( (1 +n_z +1 -n_z )/(1 -n_z) )

= 1/sqrt( 2/(1-n_z) )

So N = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector components are:

a = (n_x/(1-n_z)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) 

= n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) / (1 -n_z )

= n_x / sqrt( 2 (1 - n_z) )

Wait, because (1 -n_z) in the denominator is (1 -n_z), which is the same as sqrt( (1-n_z)^2 ) = |1 -n_z|, but since n_z is between -1 and 1, and 1 -n_z is positive (assuming n_z <1, which it is except when n is along +z), so it's safe.

Wait, but perhaps I can write this differently. Let me think about the expression.

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ a, b ] = [ n_x / sqrt( 2 (1 -n_z) ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Wait, because a was (n_x/(1 -n_z)) * N, and N is sqrt((1-n_z)/2), so a becomes (n_x/(1-n_z)) * sqrt((1-n_z)/2) ) = n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z) ) / sqrt( 2 (1 -n_z)^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me compute this again.

a = [n_x/(1-n_z)] * N = [n_x/(1-n_z)] * sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )

= n_x * sqrt( (1-n_z) ) / sqrt( 2 (1-n_z)^2 )

= n_x * sqrt(1 -n_z) / ( (1-n_z) sqrt(2) )

= n_x / ( (1 -n_z )^{1/2} * sqrt(2) )

= n_x / sqrt( 2 (1 -n_z) )

Similarly, b = 1 * N = sqrt( (1-n_z)/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ n_x / sqrt( 2 (1 -n_z) ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the simplest way to express it. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of angles.

Wait, earlier I mentioned that n is in the x-z plane, so n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_z = cosθ, and n_x = sinθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ into the eigenvector components:

a = sinθ / sqrt( 2 (1 - cosθ) )

b = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

Let me simplify these expressions. Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / sqrt( 2 * 2 sin²(θ/2) )

Denominator inside sqrt: 2 * 2 sin²(θ/2) = 4 sin²(θ/2), so sqrt is 2 sin(θ/2).

So a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / ( 2 sin(θ/2) ) ) 

= cos(θ/2 )

Similarly, b = sqrt( (2 sin²(θ/2)) / 2 )

= sqrt( sin²(θ/2) )

= sin(θ/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ]^T.

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvector components are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), but wait, I thought the angle θ was from the z-axis. So when θ=0, n is along +z. Then, the eigenvector would be [1, 0], which is correct because the spin-up along +z is (1,0).

When θ=180 degrees, n is along -z, and the eigenvector would be [ cos(90), sin(90) ] = [0,1], which is the spin-up along -z. Wait, no, because along -z, the spin-up state is (0,1) because P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T. But wait, in my calculation, the components are a = cos(θ/2) and b = sin(θ/2), but considering that the operator P_n has an eigenvalue +ħ/2, perhaps I should also account for any phase. But I think in this case, the eigenvector I found is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that would match. But wait, I thought theta is the angle from the z-axis, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is measured differently.

Wait, the problem statement says the direction is in the x-z plane, so perhaps the angle is measured differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the eigenvector in terms of the direction vector n.

Wait, but in any case, the eigenvector is of the form [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, where theta is the polar angle of the direction n. So looking at the options, option C is exactly that. Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, the options are given as vectors with hbar factors. Wait, no, looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))
Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but according to our calculation, the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but those are dimensionless. But in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless when multiplied by ħ, so perhaps the eigenvector is normalized, and the options are represented in terms of their components, but without the ħ factor. Or perhaps I made a mistake in including the hbar in the matrix.

Wait, in the problem statement, each component of P is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix. So P is a vector operator, and its components are dimensioned as ħ/2 multiplied by Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalue is ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are indeed [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, as I found.

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

But wait, let's double-check: the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So the answer should be option C. However, looking at the options again, option C is simply (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a phase factor involved. Because sometimes eigenvectors can have a global phase, but the problem says to find the normalized eigenvector, so the phase might not matter here.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction vector $\vec{n}$ can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Operator in the direction $\vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ in the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]
Substituting the matrix forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
The matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalue Equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) | \psi \rangle = 0
\]
Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from the matrix of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
The eigenvector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ satisfies:
\[
\begin{cases}
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \\
\sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 3: Solving for $a$ and $b$
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Substituting $a$ into the second equation confirms consistency. The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta \\ 1 - \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]
Normalizing the eigenvector using $a^2 + b^2 = 1$:
\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]
This matches **Option C**, which is:
\[
\left( \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right)
\]

### Final Answer
The normalized eigenvector corresponds to **Option C**.  
Answer: C
