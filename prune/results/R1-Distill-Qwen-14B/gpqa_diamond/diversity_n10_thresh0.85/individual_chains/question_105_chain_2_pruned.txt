Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The problem says that when only one hemisphere is spotted, the photometric observations (which measure brightness over time) will show periodic brightness variations because the star is rotating. These variations can look like the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have to produce the same brightness variation amplitude in the light curve?

So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

Hmm. I remember that the transit method is used to detect exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star.

In this scenario, the star's brightness variations are due to spots. So, when a spot is facing us, it's cooler and thus emits less light. As the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip and rise. But the problem states that this effect mimics the presence of an exoplanet.

So, the first thing I need to figure out is the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the amplitude that would be caused by an exoplanet of a certain radius, and solve for Rpl.

Let me think about the star's brightness variation due to the spots. The star's total brightness is the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas. Since the problem says the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, the filling factor is 0.2. Wait, filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So, the spots take up 20% of the visible hemisphere when facing us.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when only one hemisphere is spotted, the maximum coverage when the spot is directly facing us is 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, actually, the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So, for a star with radius R, the total surface area is 4πR². If one hemisphere (2πR²) has 20% of that area covered in spots, then the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spot area is 0.4πR².

But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The maximum effect is when the spot is fully visible, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, but the star's brightness is not uniform because of the spots. The unspotted parts have a higher temperature, T_eff = 6000K, and the spots are cooler, T_spot = 5000K.

Wait, when the spots are on the side facing us, their lower brightness affects the total. So the brightness variation is due to the movement of the spots in and out of view.

But to model this, perhaps we can calculate the change in the star's brightness as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by treating the brightness variation as if it's similar to a planet transit. So, maybe the dip caused by the spots is similar in amplitude to a planet transit.

Wait, the amplitude of the brightness dip when a planet transits a star is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in this case, the brightness dip is due to the spots. So let's model the brightness variation due to the spots.

The brightness of the star when all spots are on the far side (not visible) would be the same as the unspotted star. But when the spots are in view, their lower
