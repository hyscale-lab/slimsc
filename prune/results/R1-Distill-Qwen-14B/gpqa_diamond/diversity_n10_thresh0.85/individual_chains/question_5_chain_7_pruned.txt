Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P usually correspond to momentum, but maybe in this case, it's a spin operator? Because spin has components along different axes, and eigenvectors represent the spin states. Oh right, because spin-½ particles have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for their spin operators.

So the operator P given here is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down each component as given.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled.
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. Pauli Z matrix scaled.

The operator in question is vector P, so the direction is arbitrary, but lying in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n would have components (nx, 0, nz), but since it's arbitrary, we can represent it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) I think. Because in the x-z plane, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, right? So the direction is (sinθ,0,cosθ).

The operator for the direction n is given by P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because P·n is the component of P in the direction of n.

So substituting, P·n = (ħ/2)(sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] ) + (ħ/2)(cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me compute that matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0 1],[1 0]] + cosθ * [[1 0],[0 -1]] ]

So adding the matrices:

The (1,1) element is cosθ *1 = cosθ
The (1,2) element is sinθ *1 = sinθ
The (2,1) element is sinθ *1 = sinθ
The (2,2) element is cosθ*(-1) = -cosθ

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ , sinθ ],
  [ sinθ , -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. The first term for P_x is [[0 1], [1 0]], multiplied by sinθ. The second term is [[1 0],[0 -1]] multiplied by cosθ. So adding them:

Top left: 0* sinθ + 1 * cosθ → cosθ? Wait no: Wait, for the (1,1) element: the first matrix (P_x) has 0, multiplied by sinθ. The second matrix (P_z) has 1 in (1,1), multiplied by cosθ. So (1,1) is cosθ. Similarly, (1,2): P_x has 1, multiplied by sinθ, so (1,2) is sinθ. (2,1): P_x has 1, so sinθ. (2,2): P_z has -1, so -cosθ. So yes, the matrix is correct.

So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, exactly, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So let me write the equation:

P·n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

But since P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that 2x2 matrix, let me denote that matrix as M. So M = [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the equation becomes (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

M |v> = |v>

So M |v> = 1 * |v> → the eigenvalue equation for matrix M is 1.

Wait, no—wait. Because the operator is (ħ/2) M, so the eigenvalue equation is (ħ/2) M |v> = (eigenvalue) |v>. Here, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So when we divide both sides by (ħ/2), we get M |v> = ( (ħ/2) ) / (ħ/2) ) |v> → M |v> = 1 * |v>.

So M is the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], and we need to find its eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about M. Let me compute the eigenvalues of M. Because if M has eigenvalues 1 and -1, then when we multiply by ħ/2, the operator P·n would have eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, which makes sense for a spin-½ system.

So to find the eigenvectors, I need to solve (M - I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I is:

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

The determinant of (M - I) should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

Compute the determinant:

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ) = 0.

Let me compute term by term:

First term: (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = ( -cosθ (cosθ -1) -1 (cosθ -1) ) 

Wait, perhaps expanding it better:

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) 
= -(cosθ)(cosθ) - (cosθ)(-1) + (1)(cosθ) + (1)(1) ) Wait, no. Let me multiply it out:

= (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) + (-1)(-cosθ) + (-1)(-1)
Wait, no. Wait, (a)(b) where a = (cosθ-1), b=(-cosθ -1):

a*b = (cosθ)(-cosθ) + cosθ*(-1) + (-1)(-cosθ) + (-1)(-1)
= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ + 1
Simplify: -cos²θ +0 +1 = 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So term1 is sin²θ.

The second term is (sinθ)(sinθ) = sin²θ.

So determinant is (sin²θ) - (sin²θ) = 0. So yes, the determinant is zero, which means we have non-trivial solutions.

So now, to find the eigenvectors, we can set up the equation (M - I)|v> = 0.

The first row: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.
Second equation: sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0.

But since the matrix is 2x2 and the system is homogeneous, both equations should give the same condition.

Let's take the first equation:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → (1 - cosθ) v1 = sinθ v2 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

Hmm, but [ (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ ] can be simplified using trig
