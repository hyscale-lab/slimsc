Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key is figuring out which stars are bright enough for both instruments. Let me remember what I know about these spectrographs and their capabilities.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, does that mean it can detect up to 17 mag? Or brighter than 17 (which would be magnitudes less than 17, since lower magnitude numbers are brighter)? Oh right, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because anything brighter (lower magnitude) is okay.

Similarly, HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16 V mag. So HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16, right? Because 16 is the limit. So a star must have an apparent magnitude ≤16 to be detected by HIRES, and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. But since the question is about stars that can be detected by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's ≤16, it's also ≤17.

Wait, wait, actually, no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, wait, maybe I have it reversed. Wait, V magnitude scale: the brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's good for ESPRESSO. So for ESPRESSO, acceptable apparent V mag is ≤17. Because if it's brighter (lower mag) than 17, it's okay. So a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so it's acceptable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16. So for HIRES, the apparent V mag must be ≤16. So a star must have V ≤16 to be seen by
