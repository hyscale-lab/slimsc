Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state, perhaps? Or maybe each state's uncertainty must be much smaller than the energy difference between them.

Let me think again. The energy uncertainty for each state is given by ΔE = ħ / (2Δt). So for each state, we can compute the minimum uncertainty in energy based on their lifetimes.

So for state E1, Δt1 = 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 = ħ / (2Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J. Wait, but J to eV conversion is needed. Since 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J, so 5.27e-26 J is about (5.27e-26) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So roughly 3.3e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state E2, Δt2 = 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J. Converting to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties in energy for the two states are approximately 3.3e-7 eV and 3.3e-8 eV, respectively.

Wait, but how do these uncertainties affect the distinguishability of the two energy levels? I think the energy difference between the two levels (ΔE = E2 - E1) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the combined uncertainty, you can't be sure that the observed energy isn't just a fluctuation within one state, making it impossible to distinguish.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference is between E1 and E2. So, for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. The total uncertainty in the energy difference would be something like sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), assuming they're uncorrelated. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the energy difference must be larger than each individual uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal detectable energy difference is determined by the least precise measurement. Since the state with the longer lifetime (E2, Δt=1e-8 s) has a smaller energy uncertainty (since ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt). So the energy difference must be larger than the smaller of the two uncertainties, because the shorter-lived state has a larger uncertainty.

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me think again: the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in each state. Because if the actual energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty in either state, it wouldn't be possible to resolve them. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties. 

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be bigger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. No, wait, perhaps the minimum energy difference required is when the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in the energy of each state. Because if the difference is larger than either uncertainty, then they can be distinguished.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the minimum energy difference required to resolve two states based on their lifetimes. Because the longer the lifetime, the smaller the energy uncertainty.

In the problem, the two states have different lifetimes, so their energy uncertainties are different. The energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps larger than the larger one.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me rephrase: for two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the two states' energy measurements would overlap, making them indistinguishable.

So,
