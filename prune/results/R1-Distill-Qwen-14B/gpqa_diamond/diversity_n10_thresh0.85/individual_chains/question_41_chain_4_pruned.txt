Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? The options are A to D.

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going through the glass, and the glass itself is moving towards the observer. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how this affects the speed.

I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of the light would be 1/n, since c is 1 here. But what about when the glass itself is moving?

Oh right, this is a problem involving relative motion of the medium. I think the speed of light measured in the lab frame depends on whether the medium is moving towards or away from the observer. But wait, the direction here is the same as the beam. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. Wait, no, no. The beam is moving through the glass and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, but the glass is moving toward the observer.

Wait, no. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, which is toward the observer. So the beam is moving toward the observer as well. So the glass is moving at velocity v in that direction, and the beam is moving through the glass in that same direction.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is always less than c, right? So in the glass's rest frame, the speed is 1/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this has to do with the addition of velocities. Maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but glass is a non-relativistic object? Probably, since v is given as a constant velocity, but I'm not sure if v is close to c.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using Galilean addition, but that's usually only for non-relativistic speeds. Let
