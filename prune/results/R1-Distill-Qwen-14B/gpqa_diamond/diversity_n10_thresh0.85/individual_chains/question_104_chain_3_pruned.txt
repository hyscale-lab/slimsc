Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, let me remember what the radial velocity (RV) method is about. Oh right, it's when the star moves back and forth due to the planet's gravity. The Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity. The shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

The question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each planet is similar to Neptune in mass. So their masses are the same. The RV shifts are given: planet 1's shift is 5 milliangstroms, and planet 2's is 7. Since the stars are the same, the RV shift should be related to the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, but how exactly does the RV shift relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by the formula K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something). Wait, I might be mixing up the exponents.

Let me think again. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P)^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) )) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something).

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the formula as K = (v₀) = ( (27 * P) )^(-1/3) ) * (M_p / M_earth) ) * ( (M_* / M_sun) )^(-2/3) ) / ( (1 AU)^(-1/3) ) )

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Maybe I should think about the ratio of the velocities. Since the stars are the same, M_* is the same for both, and the planet masses are the same (Neptune-like, so M_p same for both). So the only variables are the orbital periods.

The RV shift (K) is proportional to (M_p / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ). Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So if K increases, the period decreases, and vice versa.

Wait, the formula I think is K = (v₀) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 + e²) )^(1/2) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(3/2) )) ) ) * (something with the period). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the formula is K = ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^2) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) )^(-1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since the planets are in circular orbits, e=0, so we can ignore that term. So K ≈ (G * M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * (2π P)^(1/3) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to consider the proportionality. Since both stars have the same mass M_*, and both planets have the same mass M_p, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, let me look up the formula. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(-1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (c^3 * M_*^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio between K1 and K2. Let me write the formula for each planet.

For planet 1: K1 = (G * M_p) / (something) * factor / P1^(1/3)
Similarly for planet 2: K2 = same factors except P2^(1/3)

Since M_p and M_* are the same for both, the ratio K1/K2 is equal to ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) ), because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (constant) / P1^(1/3), K2 = (same constant) / P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, rearranged, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But wait, let's think again. K is
