Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), leading to the corresponding butanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. Let me think about what each reaction entails.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with CN- (from NaCN), what kind of reaction is that? I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. So the ketone adds a cyanide ion, which attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then something happens with the proton.

In the cyanohydrin formation, after the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, you get an intermediate which then gets a proton. But wait, what's the role of reagent A here? Because NaCN is providing the cyanide ion, but the proton source would determine the pH and the work-up. I remember that usually, after the reaction, you might acidify or something. Or wait, no—maybe the reaction is done under acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and adding NaCN in acidic conditions? Or maybe it's done in a way that the work-up is acidic. Or perhaps the reaction is run under basic conditions? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think: The cyanide ion is a strong base, so maybe the reaction is run in a solution that can handle that, perhaps with a base like NaOH. Or wait, no—perhaps the reaction is done with an acid catalyst.

Wait, another thought: when you form a cyanohydrin, typically you have the ketone reacting with CN- in a solution where the HCN is present, but HCN is a weak acid. So maybe the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Oh wait, sometimes you might use HCN with something else. Alternatively, when using NaCN, perhaps you need a source of H+ to protonate the oxygen.

Wait, in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, no, butanenitrile would be four carbons. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I need to draw this out mentally.

Wait, butan-2-one structure is CH3-C(O)-
