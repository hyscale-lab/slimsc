Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. So, we have a star similar to the Sun, same radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, so that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. They mention that when only one hemisphere is spotted, the photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating. These variations can look like an exoplanet causing a dip in brightness when it transits.

The question is, to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve, what would be the radius of an exoplanet relative to the star? Without the spots, I guess. So, I need to find Rpl divided by Rstar.

Hmm, I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets works by measuring the dip in brightness when the planet passes in front of the star. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So, the formula is (Rpl / Rstar)^2, because area is proportional to radius squared.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't just a uniform brightness. It has these dark spots. So the observed brightness variation isn't just a simple dip. Instead, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, which affects the light curve.

The spots are cooler (6000K vs spot temp 5000K?), wait, the star is 6000K and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the total area covered by spots is 20% of (π R^2 / 2) since it's one hemisphere. Wait, no, maybe the filling factor is just 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the total area with spots is 0.20 * ( (π R^2) / 2 ). Because a hemisphere is half the sphere.

When the star rotates, the spots rotate into and out of view. So the brightness variation will depend on the area of the spots that are visible as the star spins. Since the spots are only on one hemisphere, when the star's rotation brings that
