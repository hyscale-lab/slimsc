Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. How does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A to D, each with a different power of 1/plx.

Wait, parallax... right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance to the star in parsecs. So the smaller the parallax, the farther away the star is.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, I think that means their distances are uniformly distributed? Or wait, no, because the number of stars at a certain distance depends on the volume of space. Wait, in reality, the number of stars isn't uniform with distance, but the question says to assume they are. Hmm, so maybe the number density (stars per volume) is uniform.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So perhaps it's more about their distribution on the celestial sphere rather than their distance distribution. Or maybe it's an approximation where the number per unit volume is constant.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if I have a range of parallaxes, that corresponds to a range of distances. Let's say I consider a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd. But wait, that's for a spherical shell, but in this case, we're dealing with parallax space, so maybe the approach is different.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The number of stars in a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx would be the number of stars in the corresponding range of distances.

But how does the number of stars depend on parallax? If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density n is a constant. Then the number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV.

The volume element in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in distance shell d to d+dd is n * 4π d² dd.

But since we're looking at parallax, which is 1/d, let's express d in terms of plx. d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when considering the number of stars, I think we can ignore the negative sign because we're dealing with absolute numbers.

So substituting, the number of stars in a parallax range plx to plx + dplx is:

n * 4π ( (1/plx) )² * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but the dV is 4π d² dd, which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx). So the number is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx, but since dplx is positive, the number of stars per unit dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but no, wait. The star count is in terms of per unit parallax. So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) would be dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, because dd is - (1/plx²) dplx, so substituting, dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^
