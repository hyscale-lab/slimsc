Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The question is about the ratio of the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. 

Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production is mainly through the proton-proton chain, and the pp-III branch is part of that. Oh wait, the pp chain has several branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, and pp-II and pp-III are less significant, but they still contribute. 

So the pp-III branch is responsible for producing some of the neutrinos. If it stops, that must affect the number of neutrinos emitted in certain energy ranges. But how?

I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos through the reaction where beryllium-7 captures a helium-4 nucleus to form carbon-11, which then decays, emitting a neutrino. The neutrinos from this process have a specific energy range. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact energies. I think the neutrinos from the pp-I branch are lower energy, around 0.5 MeV, and pp-III might have higher energies? Or maybe the same?

No, wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are the ones from the pp-I process, which are low energy, around 0.25 MeV. The pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos, like maybe around 0.8 MeV or so. Oh, the question mentions two bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So that's 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of the higher-energy neutrinos (like in band 2, 800-900 keV) would stop. Because the pp-III is a source for those. But does it contribute to band 1 as well?

Wait, no. Because I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos of a certain energy. So if the branch stops, the flux in band 2 would drop to almost zero, but band 1 might be from other sources. Or wait, maybe the other branches are still operating.

Wait, the question states that all other reactions remain as they were. So the pp-I and pp-II branches are still active, as well as whatever else contributes to the neutrino flux. So, what processes contribute to the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands?

Another thought: the pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, around 0.25 MeV. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy ones, maybe around 0.77 MeV? So the 700-800 keV band is around that 0.77 MeV mark, which is where the pp-III neutrinos come from. The 800-900 keV is a bit higher, so maybe from other sources or maybe not.

Wait, no. Maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have an energy around 0.77 MeV. So band 1 (700-800 keV) includes that peak. If the pp-III stops, then the flux in band 1 would drop significantly, but what about band 2?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton cycle. The main steps are:

pp-I: 2 protons → deuterium (low energy neutrino, ~0.25 MeV)
pp-II: maybe deuterium + helium-3 → beryllium-7, then captures a proton to form carbon-8, which decays into two protons and emits a neutrino?
Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: the main source of solar neutrinos is the pp-I branch, which produces about 90% of all neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III contribute less. The pp-III branch
