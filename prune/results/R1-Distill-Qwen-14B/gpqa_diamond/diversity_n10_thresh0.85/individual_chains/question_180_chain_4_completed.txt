Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. They also have negligible mass, which probably means I don't have to consider their kinetic energy or anything like that. 

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is about finding the minimum energy of this system, and the answer needs to be correct to three decimal places in Joules.

Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system... I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law. The formula is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, when there are multiple charges, each pair contributes to the total potential energy. So for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but how does that apply here? The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters away. So each of those 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, right? So each of those 12 charges has a potential energy relative to the fixed charge at P.

Let me think. The potential energy of each of the 12 charges with the fixed one would be U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, no, wait. Let's correct that. The 13th charge is at P with charge 2e. Each of the other 12 charges is 2e and at r=2m from P. So each pair (the fixed charge and one of the 12) has potential energy U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, that's (2e)^2 over 2m. So that would be 4e²/(2m) multiplied by k. But wait, wait. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

But wait, the system's total potential energy is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term with the fixed charge. So that's 12 terms, each being U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Wait, but wait another thing: for a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. So for each charge, you calculate the potential energy it contributes with all the charges that were already placed before it. But since all the charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are at 2m from it. When considering the potential energy of the system, I should sum the potential energy between each pair. So that includes each of the 12 charges with the fixed one, and also the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says 12 are constrained at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are all at the same point, or are they arranged in some way? Wait, wait, wait. The 12 charges are all at 2 meters from point P, but are they placed at the same point? Because if they are all at 2 meters but at different points, each at a distance of 2 m from P, then the potential energy between each pair of the 12 would have to be considered. But the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement relative to each other. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a spherical arrangement. Or maybe they are all at the same point, but that would cause a lot of repulsion. But maybe the problem simplifies by considering that the 12 charges are at the same point. So, all 12 charges are at a point 2 meters away from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but if that were the case, then the potential energy between the 12 charges would be between each pair. So the total potential energy would be the sum of all the pairwise potentials. Since each pair among the 12 contributes, the number of pairs is combination of 12 taken 2 at a time, which is (12*11)/2 = 66. So each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/r, where r is the distance between the two charges. But wait, wait, if all 12 charges are at the same point, then the distance r between any two charges is zero, which would make the potential energy infinite. That can't be right. So perhaps the 12 charges are each at a different point, all 2 meters from P, but spaced out so that the distance between any two is not zero. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves is negligible, or maybe the system is arranged in such a way that their mutual interactions contribute a certain amount. But since the problem gives only the positions relative to P, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are large, but that's not stated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, so that the mutual potential energy between them is the same as if they were a single charge. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if you have multiple charges at the same point, their mutual potential energy is (n choose 2) times the energy of each pair as if they were separated by some distance. But without knowing the distance between the 12 charges, I can't compute that. 

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that they are all at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are much larger, so the potential energy between them is negligible compared to their potential energy with the fixed charge at P. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the question is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges and consider only their energy with the fixed charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are constrained to stay on a sphere of radius 2m around P, but their exact positions are arranged such that their mutual distances are taken as negligible, which seems unlikely.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum would occur when the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is as low as possible. Wait, but all the charges are positive (since each is 2e, and e is positive), so bringing them closer would require more work, increasing the potential energy. Wait no, wait. Wait, for positive charges, when you bring them closer together, their potential energy increases because they repel each other. So to minimize the total energy of the system, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges would be as small as possible, which would happen when they are as far apart as possible.

But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is only possible if all the 12 charges are at the same point. But that would make their mutual potential energy infinite, which isn't possible. So maybe the problem neglects their mutual energy, considering only the energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge at P. That would make sense if the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are very large, but the problem doesn't say that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just considering the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed one, and not their mutual interactions. Maybe the question expects that. Let me proceed under that assumption, because otherwise, without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute the mutual energy.

So if I proceed under the assumption that only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge is considered, then the total potential energy U would be 12 times the energy between one 2e charge and the fixed 2e charge at a distance of 2m.

So each such pair contributes U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = (k * 4 e²) / (2m). Simplifying that gives (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, no: 4e²/(2m) is 2e²/m. So U_i = k * 2e² / m.

Wait, let me get the units right. Coulomb's constant k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C². e is 1.602e-19 C. The distance r is 2 meters.

So each of the 12 charges contributes U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4 e²)/(2m) = (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, 4e²/(2m) is 2e²/m. So U_i = (k * 2 e²) / m.

But wait, that's correct? Let me compute it.

Each pair: (2e)(2e) =4e², divided by 2m, multiplied by k. So yes, (4e² * k)/(2m) = (2 k e²)/m.

So each pair contributes (2 k e²)/m. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total U would be 12 * (2 k e²)/m.

Wait, but wait a minute. That would be U = 12 * (2 k e²)/(2m) )? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate each term.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, which has a charge of 2e. So each pair (the 13th charge and one of the 12) has a potential energy U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4 e² k) / (2m) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait, no, 4e² divided by 2m is 2e²/m. So U_i = k * (2e²)/m.

Wait, no, because (2e)*(2e) =4e². Divide by 2m gives 4e²/(2m) = 2e²/m.

So each pair contributes U_i = (k * 2e²) / m.

But wait, no, because Coulomb's law is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So here, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, and r is 2m.

So U for each pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4 e²)/(2m) = 2 k e² / m.

So each of the 12 pairs contributes 2 k e² / m.

So the total U is 12 * (2 k e² / m) )? That would be 24 k e² / m.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options given are on the order of 1e-26 J. Let me compute the value and see.

Let me plug in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m is 2 meters.

So 2e is 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C.

Wait no, no, wait. Let me think again. Each charge is 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e.

So for each pair, U = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) = k * (4 e²) / (2 m) = (2 k e²)/(m) * (e²) ?

Wait, no, let's compute it step by step.

Each pair: U = (k * q1 * q2 ) / r.

q1 = q2 = 2e.

So U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = (4 k e²) / (2 m) = (2 k e²) / m.

So each pair contributes 2 k e² / m.

Wait, no: 4 k e² / (2 m) is 2 k e² / m.

Yes.

So for 12 pairs, U = 12 * (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, that's 24 k e² / m.

Let me compute this.

Calculating each term:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

So 2k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2k e² is 2 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

So 1.602e-19 squared is about 2.566e-38.

So 2k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2 * (8.988 *2.566) * 1e9 *1e-38.

Compute 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's see: 8.988 * 2.5 is about 22.47, and 8.988 * 0.066 is about 0.594, so total around 23.064.

So 2 * 23.064 = 46.128.

Then 1e9 * 1e-38 =1e-29.

So 46.128e-29 = 4.6128e-28.

Wait, but wait, no, because 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 is 8.988 * 2.566 = let me compute more accurately.

8.988 * 2 = 17.976, 8.988 * 0.5 =4.494, 8.988 * 0.066= ~0.593. So 17.976 +4.494=22.47, +0.593=23.063. So 23.063e9 *1e-38 =23.063e-29 =2.3063e-28.

Multiply by 2: 4.6126e-28.

So that's per pair, the 2k e²/m. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because m is 2 meters. So the denominator is 2 meters.

So 2k e² / m = 4.6126e-28 / 2 = 2.3063e-28 J per pair.

Now, for 12 pairs, multiply by 12: 12 * 2.3063e-28 = 27.6756e-28 = 2.76756e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, that's 2.76756e-27 J, which is approximately 2.768e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the energy step by step.

Each pair: U = k (2e)(2e) / (2m).

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So 2e = 3.204e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.265e-38 C² ≈ 1.0265e-37 C².

So U per pair = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / (2*2).

Wait, because r is 2 meters.

So denominator is 2*2 m =4 m.

So U = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / 4.

Compute that:

8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 ≈ (8.988 * 1.0265) * 1e9 *1e-37.

8.988 *1.0265 ≈ approximately 9.23.

So 9.23e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.23e-28 /4 ≈ 2.307e-28 J per pair.

So for 12 pairs, 12 * 2.307e-28 = 27.68e-28 = 2.768e-27 J.

Wait, so that's 2.768e-27 J. But looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger by a factor of about 10. So either I made a mistake in my calculation, or perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I missed that each of the 12 charges is contributing 2e, but also, the 13th charge is fixed, so each of the 12 has a potential energy with the 13th, but maybe there's another consideration.

Wait, no, I think I accounted for all 12 charges being at 2m from P, each interacting with the fixed charge.

Wait, but perhaps I should also consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Oh no, that's the part I was avoiding earlier because it's unclear. But if I'm getting an answer that's not matching the options, perhaps that's the missing piece.

So, if the 12 charges are all at 2m from P but are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are zero, which would make their potential energy between each pair infinite. But that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the 12 charges as a single point at 2m from P, but that would mean the mutual energy is considered once.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the 12 charges are all at the same point, meaning that the potential energy between each pair among the 12 is (1/2) * (number of pairs) * (each pair's energy). But without knowing their mutual distance, I can't compute this. So perhaps the question is only asking about the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, not their mutual energy. Let's proceed with that.

So, according to my earlier calculation, the total U is 2.768e-27 J, which is about 2.77e-27 J. But looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times larger. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation when computing (2e)^2.

Wait, 2e is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-19 C.

So (3.204e-19)^2 = 10.265e-38 C² = 1.0265e-37 C².

So (2e)^2 is correct.

Then, U per pair is (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / 4.

Wait, 8.988e9 is approximately 9e9.

So 9e9 * 1e-37 = 9e-28.

Divided by 4: 2.25e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 27e-28 = 2.7e-27 J.

So 2.7e-27 J is the total U if we ignore the mutual energy between the 12 charges. But none of the options seem to match that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

Hmm, 2.7e-27 is closest to option C, which is 7.056e-27, but it's about 2.6 times larger than my result. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I forgot to multiply by the number of pairs correctly.

Wait, no, the 12 charges each interact with the fixed charge once. So 12 pairs.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should also consider the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and themselves. So maybe the total potential energy is the sum of all pairs, including the 12 among themselves and the 12 with the fixed charge.

Wait, but without knowing their mutual distances, I can't calculate that. So perhaps the problem expects that the mutual energy between the 12 is considered as a point charge at 2m, meaning that it's treated as a single charge. But that doesn't make sense, because each of the 12 is a separate point charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the 12 charges as a single point charge of 12*2e = 24e, located at 2m from P.

Wait, that might change the calculation. Let me think about that.

If the 12 charges are treated as a single point charge at 2m, then the potential energy between the fixed charge (2e) and the combined 12 charges (24e) would be U = k*(2e)*(24e)/(2m) = k*(48 e²)/(2m) = 24 k e²/m.

But wait, then the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, if they were all at the same point, would be (12 choose 2) * U_single, where U_single is the potential energy between two charges at zero distance (which would be infinite, so that doesn't make sense). So that approach doesn't seem valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero, which would make the total potential energy the same as the sum of their interactions with the fixed charge. But as I did earlier, that gives 2.76e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of the others. No, no, because I'm only considering the potential with the fixed charge.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy of the entire system, including all the interactions, but I'm missing a factor.

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers more precisely to see.

Compute U per pair (each of the 12 with the fixed charge):

U = k * (2e)^2 / (2m) = k * (4e²)/(2m) = (2 k e²) / m.

Now, let's compute each term numerically.

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m = 2 meters.

So 2e = 3.204e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = 10.265e-38 C².

U per pair = (8.988e9) * (10.265e-38) / (2 * 2) = (8.988e9 * 10.265e-38) /4.

Compute 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38:

8.988 * 10.265 ≈ let's compute:

8 *10=80, 8 *0.265=2.12 → 82.12.

0.988 *10=9.88, 0.988 *0.265≈0.262 → 9.88+0.262≈10.142.

Total: 82.12 +10.142 =92.262.

So approximately 92.262e-29 → wait, because 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29.

So 92.262e-29 → 9.2262e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.2262e-28 /4 = 2.30655e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 2.30655e-28 *12 =27.6786e-28 = 2.76786e-27 J.

Hmm, so that's about 2.768e-27 J, but none of the options match that. The closest is option C: 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of exponents. Let me recheck.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = (8.988 *10.265) * (1e9 *1e-38) )=92.26e-29.

Wait, 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29. So 92.26e-29 is 9.226e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.226e-28 /4 =2.3065e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.3065e-28 *12=27.678e-28=2.7678e-27 J.

Hmm, this is about 2.7678e-27 J. None of the options match this exactly, but perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: is the potential energy between two point charges given by U = k q1 q2 / r, or is it U = (1/2) k q1 q2 / r? Because sometimes when you calculate the work done to assemble the system, you might have to account for each charge being placed into a potential created by others. So for a system of n charges, each added one by one, the potential energy is calculated as the sum of each charge multiplied by the potential due to all the previous charges.

Wait, but in this case, since the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are brought into place one by one, each at a distance of 2m from P. So each time you bring a charge, you're adding its potential energy as (k * 2e * 2e) / (2m), but considering that all previous charges are already at 2m.

Wait, but wait, when you bring the first charge, the potential at P is due to the fixed charge. So the potential energy of the first charge is U1 = (k * 2e * 2e)/(2m). For the second charge, the potential at P is still due to the fixed charge and the first charge. But the first charge is at 2m from P, so the potential at P is due to the fixed charge and the first charge.

Wait, but the potential at P before placing the second charge is due to the fixed charge (2e) and the first charge (2e) at 2m. So the potential at P is V = (k * 2e)/(2m) + (k * 2e)/(2m) ) = (2 k e)/(m) + (2 k e)/(m) = 4 k e/(m).

Wait, but then the potential energy of the second charge when placed is (2e) * V = (2e) * (4 k e/(m)) )= 8 k e² /m.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge from infinity to 2m, which is the potential at 2m multiplied by the charge.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.

The potential energy of a charge q in an electric potential V is U = q V. So when placing the second charge, the potential at 2m from P is due to the fixed charge (2e) and the first charge (2e) at 2m.

Wait, wait, no. The first charge is at 2m from P. So the potential at 2m due to the fixed charge is V1 = k*(2e)/(2m) = k e/(m).

The potential at 2m due to the first charge (when placing the second charge) is V2 = k*(2e)/(r), where r is the distance between the first and second charges. But if the first and second charges are both at 2m from P, but their mutual distance is zero (if they're placed at the same point), then V2 is infinite, which isn't correct. So perhaps the 12 charges are placed at different points, each 2m from P, but the mutual distances are r.

But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's intended to ignore their mutual potential energies. So in that case, the potential at P when placing each additional charge is only due to the fixed charge.

Wait, but that can't be right because each charge placed would contribute to the potential at P.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. The formula for the total potential energy of a system of charges is U = (1/2) Σ U_ij, where U_ij is the potential energy between each pair of charges. So the factor of 1/2 comes from each pair being counted once.

In this problem, there are 13 charges. Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge, and each of the 12 charges interacts with the others.

So the total U is U = U_12 + U_12inter.

Where U_12 is the potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and U_12inter is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

But without knowing their mutual distances, perhaps we can't compute U_12inter. So the problem might only be asking for U_12.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the 12 charges as a single point, leading to their mutual energy being considered as a single term.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me see if any of the options match the value I computed earlier.

Earlier, I calculated U_12 as 2.768e-27 J. The options don't have this, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the exponent when calculating (2e)^2. Let me compute (2e)^2 again.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

2e = 3.204e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 = (3.204)^2 * 1e-38 = 10.265 * 1e-38 =1.0265e-37 C².

So that's correct.

Then, U per pair = k * (2e)^2 / (2m) = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / (4) → because r is 2m.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 = (8.988 *1.0265) * 1e9 *1e-37 = (9.23) * 1e-28 → 9.23e-28.

Divide by 4 → 2.307e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 → 27.68e-28 = 2.768e-27 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

So perhaps the problem expects that the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered. But without knowing their arrangement, I can't compute that. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are considered as a single charge located 2m away, which would change the calculation.

Wait, if I treat the 12 charges as a single charge, then the potential energy would be U = k*(2e)*(24e)/(2m) = k*(48 e²)/(2m) = (24 k e²)/m.

Wait, but that's only considering the interaction between the fixed charge and the combined 12 charges as a single point. But then, the mutual potential energy among the 12 would be U_12inter = (1/2) * (number of pairs) * U_single.

But without knowing their mutual distance, this doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem expects only the interaction between the fixed charge and the 12 charges, which gives 2.768e-27 J, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the 12 charges are at 2 cm instead of 2 meters. Let me try that.

If r is 2 cm = 0.02 m.

Then, U per pair = (2 k e² ) / (0.02).

Which would be 2 k e² * 50 = 100 k e².

But let's compute:

U per pair = (2 k e² ) / 0.02 = (2 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) /0.02.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Then 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 2:4.612e-28.

Divide by 0.02 (which is 50):4.612e-28 *50=2.306e-26.

Multiply by 12: 2.306e-26 *12=2.767e-25 J. That's way larger than the options, so perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 2.822e-26 J. Which is about 10 times larger than my calculated 2.768e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me check the units again.

Wait, another idea: Did I forget to account for the fact that each pair contributes twice? Because when I'm calculating U as (1/2) Σ U_ij, but perhaps I didn't, which could affect the result.

Wait, no, because I multiplied by 12, each of which is a unique pair with the fixed charge. So each pair is only counted once. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the formula for potential energy between charges is (1/2) Σ U_ij. So perhaps I should multiply by 1/2. No, that's not the case here because each of the 12 charges is paired once with the fixed charge, and each such pair is unique. So the total number of such pairs is 12, not 12 choose 2.

Wait, but the formula for the system's potential energy is (1/2) times the sum of all pair potentials because each pair is counted twice when you sum over all charges. But in this case, the 12 charges are interacting with a single charge, so it's 12 pairs, each counted once. So the total would be the sum of each pair, which is 12 * U_i.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as a single entity, so the potential energy is U = k*(2e)*(24e)/(2m) = (48 e² k)/(2m) ) = 24 e² k / m.

Wait, 24 e² k / m.

Let's compute that.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

24 * e² = 24 *2.566e-38 ≈6.158e-37.

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 6.158e-37 = (8.988 *6.158) *1e-28.

8.988 *6 =53.928, 8.988 *0.158≈1.428. So total ≈55.356.

So 55.356e-28 =5.5356e-27.

Divide by m=2: 5.5356e-27 / 2 =2.7678e-27 J.

Again, same as before. So that's 2.7678e-27 J, which is not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as fixed and the 13th is being placed. But that's unlikely.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy as (1/2) Σ U_ij, including all pairs. So including the 12 charges among themselves and each with the fixed charge.

So:

U_total = U_12 + U_12inter.

But without knowing the mutual distances of the 12, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius 2m, and their mutual potential energy is (11/2) times something. But I'm not familiar with the exact formula for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12 charges, and not their mutual energy. So the answer would be 2.768e-27 J, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2.822e-26 J. Which is about 10 times larger than my calculation. Did I miss a factor of 10?

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponent in the calculation. Let me compute more accurately.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 =10.265e-38 C².

So U per pair = (8.988e9) * (10.265e-38) / (2 * 2) → denominator is 4 m.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *10.265e-38 = (8.988 *10.265) * 1e9 *1e-38.

8.988 *10 =89.88, 8.988 *0.265≈2.382 → total 92.262.

So 92.262e-29 =9.2262e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.2262e-28 /4 =2.30655e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 2.30655e-28 *12 =27.6786e-28 =2.76786e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, but option B is 2.822e-26, which is 10 times larger. Did I use 2 meters instead of 0.2 meters?

If I had a radius of 0.2 meters (20 cm), let's see what happens.

r =0.2 m.

Then U per pair = (2 k e²) / (0.2) = 10 * 2 k e² / 2 =10 * k e².

Wait, no:

Wait, for r=0.2 m:

U per pair = (k * (2e)^2 ) / r → (8.988e9 * (3.204e-19)^2 ) / 0.2.

Compute (3.204e-19)^2 =1.0265e-37.

So 8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 =9.226e-28.

Divide by 0.2 → 9.226e-28 /0.2 =4.613e-27.

Multiply by 12 →55.356e-27=5.5356e-26 J. That's about 5.54e-26 J, which is close to option A (5.645e-26).

But the problem says the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, so I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me check.

The potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

For each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, that's correct.

So with 12 such pairs, U = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) ) =12* k*(4e²)/(2m) =12 * (2 k e²)/(m).

Wait, 12 * 2 is 24, so U = (24 k e² )/m.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I had U =24 k e²/(2m) → because r=2m. Wait, no. Let me recalculate.

Wait, U per pair is (k*(2e)^2)/r = (k *4 e² )/ (2) → because r=2m.

So U per pair is (4 k e² )/(2) = 2 k e².

Wait, no, that can't be right because the units are off. Oh no! I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, because r is in meters. So the correct calculation is:

U per pair = (k * (2e)^2 ) / r → (8.988e9) * ( (3.204e-19)^2 ) / 2.

Wait, that's correct. So the mistake must have been elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exponents properly.

Let me compute U per pair again:

(2e)^2 = (3.204e-19)^2 =1.0265e-37 C².

So U per pair = (8.988e9) * (1.0265e-37) / 2.

Which is (8.988e9 * 1.0265e-37 ) /2.

8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 = (8.988 *1.0265) *1e9 *1e-37 → 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2 →4.613e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 →55.356e-28 =5.5356e-27 J.

Wait, that's 5.536e-27 J, which is still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term without approximating.

Compute 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 *1.0265.

8 *1.0265=8.212.

0.988 *1.0265= approx 1.014 (since 1 *1.0265=1.0265, 0.988 is about 0.988 → 1.0265 *0.988 ≈ 1.014).

So total is 8.212 +1.014=9.226.

So 9.226e-28.

Divide by 2→4.613e-28.

Multiply by 12→55.356e-28=5.5356e-27 J.

Same result as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the minimum energy occurs when the 12 charges are placed as far away as possible, but in this scenario, they're constrained at 2m. So perhaps there's another factor I'm missing, like the potential energy due to the configuration of the 12 charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the energy of a point charge in a potential, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the 12 charges as a single charge, so the potential at P due to the 12 charges is 12 * (2e) / (2m) = (24e)/(2m) =12e/m.

Then, the potential energy of this combined charge (24e) at P would be U = (24e) * (12e)/(2m) → no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the potential at P due to the 12 charges is V = k*(24e)/(2m) =12 k e/(m).

Then, the potential energy of the fixed charge (2e) at P is U = (2e) * V =2e * (12 k e/m )=24 k e² / m.

But that's the same as treating the 12 charges as a single charge, which gives U=24 k e²/m.

Let me compute that.

24 * 8.988e9 =24 *8.988e9=215.712e9.

Multiply by e²: 215.712e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, e² is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 215.712e9 *2.566e-38 =215.712 *2.566e-29.

215.712 *2.566 is approximately 215 *2.5=537.5, 215 *0.066≈14.19 → total≈551.69.

So 551.69e-29 =5.5169e-26.

Divide by m=2 →5.5169e-26 /2=2.75845e-26 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 2.758e-26 J, which is close to option B (2.822e-26).

But how?

Wait, perhaps this approach is correct. Because when you treat the 12 charges as a single charge of 24e at 2m from P, the potential at P due to this single charge is V =k*(24e)/(2m) =12 k e/m.

The fixed charge at P is 2e, so its potential energy is U = q * V =2e *12 k e/m =24 k e²/m.

So U =24 k e²/m.

Let me compute that.

k=8.988e9.

e=1.602e-19.

m=2.

So 24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

e²=2.566e-38.

So 215.712e9 * 2.566e-38 = (215.712 *2.566) *1e9 *1e-38.

215.712 *2.566 ≈552.

So 552e-29 =5.52e-27.

Divide by m=2 →5.52e-27 /2=2.76e-27 J.

Wait, that brings us back to the same number, 2.76e-27 J.

Hmm. I'm not sure where the discrepancy is. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at P, which is then multiplied by the fixed charge.

So the potential at P due to the 12 charges is V =12 * (k*(2e)/(2m)) =12 * (k e)/(m).

Then, the potential energy of the fixed charge (2e) is U = (2e) * V =2e *12 k e/m=24 k e²/m.

Which gives 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 /2.

Wait, let me compute that:

24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

Multiply them: 215.712e9 *2.566e-38 =5.52e-27.

Divide by 2:2.76e-27 J.

Same result as before.

So, I'm confident that the correct calculation gives approximately 2.76e-27 J, but the options don't have this. The closest option is C:7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem includes the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. But without knowing their mutual distances, that's impossible. So perhaps the problem expects that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which is not possible unless they're at infinite distance. But that would make their potential energy zero, which would make the total U=2.76e-27 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as a single point, but my earlier calculation treating them as a single charge gives U=2.76e-27 J, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement again.

The problem says the 13th charge is fixed at P. 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges being placed at 2m from P, considering the potential at P due to all other charges.

So when placing the first charge, the potential at P is due to the fixed charge (2e) and the other 11 charges. But that complicates things because each charge's placement affects the potential for the next.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the system's potential energy as the sum of each charge's potential energy when placed, considering the potential created by all the other charges already in place.

In that case, the first charge placed would feel the potential from the fixed charge (2e) at P. The potential at 2m due to the fixed charge is V1 =k*(2e)/(2m)=k e/m.

The potential energy when placing the first charge is U1 = (2e) * V1 =2e * k e/m=2 k e²/m.

The second charge is placed at another point 2m from P. The potential at P now includes the fixed charge (2e) and the first charge (2e) at a distance of 2m. So the potential at P is V2 =k*(2e)/(2m) + k*(2e)/(r12), where r12 is the distance between the first and second charges. But if the charges are placed on a sphere (like a regular dodecahedron), the average distance might be considered, but without specific information, this is impossible to compute.

Thus, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are zero, which would make the total U=12 * U_i, where U_i=2 k e² /m.

So, with U=12*(2 k e²/m) =24 k e²/m.

But earlier, that gave 2.76e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for Coulomb's constant, such as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

k=9e9.

So U_i per pair = (9e9)*(2e)^2/(2m) =9e9 * (4e²)/(2*2) → wait, no, r=2m.

Wait, U_i per pair =9e9*(4e²)/(2m) → no, wait, (2e)^2 is 4e².

So U_i =9e9 *4e² / (2m) = (36e9 e²)/(2m)=18e9 e²/m.

Wait, no, wait: 9e9 *4e² is 36e9 *e².

Divide by 2m → 18e9 *e² / m.

So for 12 pairs, U=12 *18e9 *e²/m.

Compute:

e²= (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

m=2.

So 12 *18e9 *2.566e-38 /2.

12 *18=216.

216e9 *2.566e-38=216*2.566=553. So 553e-29 =5.53e-27.

Divide by 2:5.53e-27 /2=2.765e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should select the closest option to my calculated value. My calculation gives approximately 2.77e-27 J, which isn't listed. The options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

So option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger than my result. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, but when considering their mutual distances, their potential energy with each other is considered. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is included.

If the 12 charges are placed on a sphere of radius 2m, then the distance between any two adjacent charges can be approximated.

The formula for the distance between adjacent charges on a sphere is r = 2*R*sin(π/n), where n is the number of charges. For 12 charges, n=12.

So r =2 *2m * sin(π/12) =4m * sin(15 degrees).

Sin(15 degrees)≈0.2588.

So r≈4m *0.2588=1.035m.

So the distance between each pair is approximately 1.035 meters.

Now, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges is U= k*(2e)^2/(1.035).

Number of such pairs is (12 choose 2)=66.

So U_12inter =66 * (k*(4e²)/(1.035)).

Compute that:

4e²= (3.204e-19)^2=1.0265e-37.

So 4e²=1.0265e-37.

So U_12inter =66 * (8.988e9 *1.0265e-37 /1.035).

Compute 8.988e9 *1.0265e-37=9.226e-28.

Divide by 1.035≈8.89e-28.

Multiply by 66: 66 *8.89e-28≈5.86e-26 J.

So the mutual potential energy is about 5.86e-26 J.

The potential energy between the 12 charges and the fixed charge is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )=12*(k *4e²)/(2*2m) )=12*(k *4e²)/(4m) )=12*(k e²)/m.

Compute that:

k e² =8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 =8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.306e-28.

Multiply by 12:27.67e-28=2.767e-27 J.

So total U = U_12inter + U_12 =5.86e-26 +2.767e-27 ≈6.136e-26 J.

Which is closer to option B (2.822e-26) but not quite matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the potential energy with the fixed charge, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

I'm running out of time, so I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the calculations without considering mutual energy, the closest option is C:7.056e-27 J. But I'm not sure.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \). The total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at \( P \).

### Key Formula
The potential energy between two point charges is given by:
\[
U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
\]
where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) is Coulomb's constant, \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Potential Energy Between One Pair
For one pair (the fixed charge at \( P \) and one of the 12 charges at \( 2 \, \text{m} \)):
\[
U_{\text{pair}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = k \frac{4e^2}{2} = 2k \frac{e^2}{1}.
\]
Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):
\[
U_{\text{pair}} = 2 \times 8.988 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2.566 \times 10^{-38}}{1} = 4.613 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Total Potential Energy for 12 Pairs
Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy is:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 12 \times U_{\text{pair}} = 12 \times 4.613 \times 10^{-28} = 5.536 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Comparison with Options
The calculated total potential energy is approximately \( 2.768 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), which does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is about 2.55 times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the closest match to the computed value is:

**Answer: C**
