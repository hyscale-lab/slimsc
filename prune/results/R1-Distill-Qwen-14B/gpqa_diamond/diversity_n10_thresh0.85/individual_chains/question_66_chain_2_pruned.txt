Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the idea is that any operator in SMEFT should maintain those symmetries.

Let me start by recalling each symmetry:

Lorentz symmetry: This includes rotations and boosts. It's a fundamental symmetry in relativity, ensuring the laws of physics are the same for all observers. So operators must respect this, right? Because if they didn't, they'd break relativity, which isn't part of SMEFT's framework.

Poincare symmetry: That's the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. It includes things like momentum conservation. So if Lorentz is required, does Poincare come along automatically? Or is it treated separately? I'm a bit confused here. I think Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz plus translations. So if the theory respects Lorentz, does it necessarily respect Poincare? Or is Poincare another layer?

Hmm, wait. SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, which is a Poincare-invariant theory. So the effective operators must preserve Poincare symmetry as well. So if that's the case, then both Lorentz and Poincare are required. But wait, isn't Poincare more about the overall structure of spacetime, including translations? So if the theory is formulated in a way that includes all Poincare symmetries, then yes, operators must respect that.

Then there's CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Charge conjugation changes particles into their antiparticles, and parity is spatial inversion. But wait, the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes like in the CKM matrix. So, in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP? Or can they include terms that violate it?

I think SMEFT includes all possible operators, including those that violate CP. Because SMEFT is supposed to be a general effective theory, not restricted by any particular symmetry beyond what's already in the Standard Model. Wait, no. SMEFT is an effective theory that maintains the same symmetries as the SM, but allows for higher-dimensional operators. So if the SM doesn't have a symmetry, SMEFT shouldn't enforce it either. So since the SM doesn't respect CP, SMEFT operators can violate CP. So operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

Then there's CPT symmetry. CPT combines Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric, so any effective theory should also respect CPT. Because all interactions in the SM are CPT symmetric, so SMEFT must respect it as well. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT.

Putting it all together: SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. Do they have to respect Poin
