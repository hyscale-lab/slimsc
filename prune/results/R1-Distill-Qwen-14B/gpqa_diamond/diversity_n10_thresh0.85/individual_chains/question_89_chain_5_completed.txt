Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break it down.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Product 2 is then ozonolysed at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Let me start by figuring out what each product is.

1. Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Hmm. KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with strong bases, it's often an elimination reaction. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons in a way that allows for dehydrohalogenation.

So elimination would form an alkene. The product would likely be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but let me think. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is bonded to three others, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between C1 and C2, or perhaps between C2 and C3?

Wait, no. Wait, elimination typically forms the more substituted double bond, which is more stable. But in adamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Elimination would form a bridge between the two bridgeheads, making a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are not usually allowed due to Bredt's rule. Oh wait, adamantane's structure is such that the bridgehead can support a double bond because of the adjacent rings. I think that in adamantane derivatives, bridgehead double bonds are possible. So the product would be a diene, perhaps 1,3-diene, but more likely, elimination would produce a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or maybe each elimination removes a Br and an adjacent H, leading to a single double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3. Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 and another between 3 and 4? But wait, that might not be feasible because the structure of adamantane is such that each bridgehead is connected in a way that double bonds bridge across. Or perhaps it's a single double bond between carbons 1 and 3? No, because those are not adjacent. Wait, maybe each Br is on adjacent bridgeheads. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps upon elimination, a single double bond forms. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, maybe each Br is on adjacent bridgehead carbons which are not directly connected. Elimination would form a double bond between those bridgeheads, making a bridgehead double bond. But I'm not entirely sure if that's allowed. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a different face, and elimination forms a single double bond.

The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but that doesn't make sense if it's an elimination product. Unless I'm wrong. Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Oh, wait. Alternatively, with KOH, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, and with strong base and heat, it's more likely an elimination reaction. But if the IR shows a carbonyl, that suggests a ketone or ester is formed. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the product is a diketone? How?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then further reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation. Wait, no, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering the structure correctly. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on two bridgehead carbons. When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -O- group. Wait, but that would form an ether. But how?

Alternatively, KOH could cause the formation of an epoxide, but that would require an adjacent dihalide. Wait, 1,3-dibromo is not adjacent. Oh wait, no, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions may not be adjacent. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR data for product 1.

The ¹H NMR of product 1 is: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 4.79 ppm is a singlet integrating for 2H. That could be an -OCH2O- group, like a bridge between two oxygens. Or maybe a CH2 adjacent to oxygen. Alternatively, it could be a ketone adjacent to CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide's protons, but epoxide protons usually appear around 3-4 ppm. Hmm, but 4.79 is higher, maybe near an oxygen.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diketone. But then, where would the 4.79 ppm peak come from? Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but then the IR would show an epoxide peak around 1250 cm⁻¹. Wait, but 1720 is more like a ketone or ester. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, but how would elimination form a ketone? Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but with two equivalents of KOH. But vicinal dihalides can undergo substitution to form either a gem-diolate or elimination. Wait, but with excess KOH, perhaps it's two substitutions. But 1,3-dibromide would require two substitutions, but that's not possible because they're not on the same carbon.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, so an elimination followed by a substitution? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's more about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So the 1 and 3 positions are bridgeheads. So when KOH is added, perhaps the two Br leave, and after elimination, we get a double bond, but that might not create a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me move to the IR data. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which is a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but oxidation. But KOH isn't oxidizing. Unless it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps a double dehydrohalogenation occurs, forming a cyclopropane ring. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diepoxide? But that would require two epoxide groups, and the IR would show the epoxide carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but then it would be a diol. However, that wouldn't explain the IR peak at 1720.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Maybe the elimination of HBr leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires a diol. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's an intermediate where two OH groups are formed, but under basic conditions, perhaps dehydration occurs. So maybe we form a carbonyl via elimination.

Wait, perhaps an example: If you have a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromoethane) and you treat it with KOH, you get ethylene. But in this case, elimination of HBr twice from 1,3-dibromoadamantane might form a double bond, but that doesn't produce a carbonyl. So I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is acting as a base, and the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but the IR doesn't show C=C absorption. Wait, but 1720 is a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone, but how?

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't 1,3-dibromoadamantane but 1,3-dibromo... something else. Wait, no, the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid structure where each bridgehead carbon is connected to three others. When two bridgehead carbons have Br, perhaps elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. But since bridgehead double bonds are possible in adamantane derivatives (like norbornene), maybe that's what happens.

So product 1 is 1,3-diene in adamantane structure, but that doesn't explain the IR peak. Unless the product is a diketone, which would require some sort of oxidation, which KOH doesn't provide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How to form a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Maybe via elimination of HBr and oxidation, but KOH isn't oxidizing. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that's not a carbonyl. Wait, epoxides have C-O-C, but the carbonyl in IR would be the epoxide's C-O stretch, which is around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ether, like a dioxane. But again, the IR would show the ether's C-O stretch, not a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the base abstracts a beta-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination usually forms a double bond, not a carbonyl. Unless it's a keto-enol type of situation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But the IR doesn't show OH stretches, and the NMR doesn't have broad signals, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, but how?

Wait, another angle: The ¹H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet, so no splitting. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe an ether, like OCH2O, but then the IR would show C-O-C, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a glycol, but that would imply an epoxide opening, which would require a different setup.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the first step. Let me think about the next steps, maybe that will help.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps for Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe product 2 is an acylium ion or something for Friedel-Crafts. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is a diketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of cyclization, like forming a cyclic ketone or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration.

Wait, but product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. But product 3 is the result after ozonolysis.

Wait, let me think about product 3's structure. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically cleave each double bond and form carbonyl groups. But if product 2 has a more substituted or conjugated diene, the ozonolysis products would vary.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me focus again on product 1.

Given that the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is probably a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So maybe a ketone with a CH2 next to it.

Wait, for example, a structure like O=C-CH2- something. But in adamantane, that would be part of a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone where a bridgehead is part of a carbonyl group. Like, maybe dehydrohalogenation forms a carbonyl via some cyclization.

Wait, I think I need to consider if the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with KOH, it loses HBr twice and forms a carbonyl group via some rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the reaction is the formation of a ketone via elimination of two equivalents of HBr. For example, when vicinal dihalides lose two equivalents of HX, a ketone can form if the adjacent carbons are connected in a way that allows the formation of a carbonyl. Let me think: For example, if you have CH2Br-CH2Br, losing two HBr gives CH2=CH2, which isn't a ketone. But if the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, considering adamantane's structure, perhaps when 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, the two carbons (1 and 3) become carbonyls. So each Br is on a carbon that, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl group. That would lead to a diketone.

So product 1 would be 1,3-diketoadamantane or something similar.

The NMR of product 1 would then have the 2H at 4.79 ppm. Wait, if it's a diketone, the adjacent CH2 group would be between two carbonyls. So perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

Wait, but in the case of adamantane, that's not possible because the bridgehead carbons are connected in a way that doesn't allow for a straight CH2-CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridged CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyls are adjacent, making a cyclic diketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

The NMR shows 2H at 4.79 as a singlet, which indicates no neighboring hydrogens. So in a diketone, if there's a CH2 group between two carbonyls, the protons on that CH2 would be equivalent and split into a singlet. That makes sense. So the structure would have a CH2 group between two carbonyls.

So product 1 is likely a diketone, perhaps 1,2-diketone or something similar in the adamantane structure.

Now, the NMR data also shows 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm. Those are likely the protons on the adamantane rings, perhaps in a deshielded environment due to the adjacent carbonyl groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps part of a bridge or another position.

Moving on, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used to catalyze Friedel-Crafts reactions. But product 1 is a diketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of cyclization or acylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but I'm not sure because adamantane is not an aromatic compound. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, another possibility: When a diketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, it could undergo a cyclization to form an enol ether or another structure. Alternatively, perhaps the diketone undergoes a crossed aldol condensation, but that typically requires a base.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diacid, but no, the IR shows a carbonyl, not an acid (which would have a broader peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ and a strong OH stretch, which isn't mentioned).

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a dienol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the next step. Product 2 is ozonolysed at -78°C, and then dimethyl sulfide is added. Ozone cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So product 2 must have at least one double bond. So perhaps product 2 is a diene. But how?

Wait, going back, product 1 is a diketone. If product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it's undergoing a dehydration reaction to form a double bond. So, product 2 could be an enone (a conjugated enol with a ketone), like a cyclohexenone derivative.

Wait, but product 1 is a diketone. So perhaps when heated with Al isopropoxide, one of the ketone groups is involved in forming a double bond. Alternatively, maybe two ketone groups react to form a conjugated diene.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe the diketone undergoes a cyclization to form a conjugated diene. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone loses CO2, but that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but earlier I thought that doesn't fit the IR data. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. So I'm back to thinking product 1 is a diketone.

So, product 1: 1,3-diketone in adamantane structure.

Heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide: Maybe the diketone undergoes a dehydration to form a conjugated dienone. Because Al isopropoxide can protonate oxygen and facilitate the loss of water, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So product 2 would be a dienone, perhaps a conjugated enone system.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave each double bond. Wait, but if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a conjugated diene (like 1,3-pentadiene) would give two carbonyl groups. For example, ozonolysis of 1,3-butadiene gives two aldehydes. But if the diene is part of a ring, like in a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would break the ring into a chain with two carbonyls.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. If product 2 is a dienone, perhaps with a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, but that's a linear structure, which isn't likely in adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic diene with a conjugated system.

Wait, but let's think about ozonolysis. When ozone is bubbled through a solution at -78°C, it forms ozonides, which upon workup (like with dimethyl sulfide) break into carbonyl compounds.

So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, formed by breaking both double bonds. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, product 3's NMR is what we're after. So let me think what the structure would look like.

If product 3 has multiple carbonyl groups, the protons adjacent to them would be deshielded. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one nearest to the carbonyl group.

Alternatively, if product 3 has an aldehyde group, the alpha protons would couple with adjacent protons.

Wait, let's get back. Let me outline the possible steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (diketone via elimination)
2. product 1 heated with Al isopropoxide → product 2 (possibly dienone)
3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (with carbonyls)

But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

Another approach: The first reaction is elimination to form an epoxide. Wait, but with KOH, probably not. Alternatively, the first reaction could be a substitution, but that's less likely.

Wait, product 1's NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a distinctive shift, which is higher than typical CH2 groups. Maybe it's an OCH2O group. But then, IR would show C-O-C, not a carbonyl.

Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. So the only way that OCH2O would fit is if it's part of an acetal or something, but that doesn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 adjacent to two carbonyls, making it deshielded and as a singlet.

So, perhaps product 1 is a diketone with a CH2 between two carbonyls. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a dehydration to form a conjugated dienone (product 2). Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond(s) in product 2, breaking them into carbonyls.

Wait, but if product 2 is a dienone (two double bonds), ozonolysis would cleave each, leading to multiple carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, so ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. Let's think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In ozonolysis, the product typically has carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. So if product 2 was a diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. But the exact structure would determine the coupling.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone. Then, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be split based on neighboring Hs.

But considering the options, the coupling patterns are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and it's next to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would couple with the neighboring CH2's Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, which is next to a CH2 group. That would lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to coupling patterns.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, if product 2 was a diene, say CH2=CH-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would break into two aldehydes, so O=CH-CH2-CHO. But that's a linear structure, which would have different NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, like cyclohexene. Ozonolysis of cyclohexene would give six carbonyl groups, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a structure that makes the CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyls, leading to specific coupling.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think of the options again.

The coupling pattern options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

The most deshielded H would likely be the one closest to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. The neighboring Hs would split the signal.

If the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would have neighboring Hs on both sides. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the central CH2 groups would each have two neighboring Hs on adjacent CH2 groups. So each H would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but triplet of triplets would be a more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two different sets of neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: The deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to another CH2, and each of those CH2s has two Hs. So each H on the CH2 would have coupling with two Hs on one side and two on the other. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, but that seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, if the deshielded H is on a CH group next to a CH2, that could lead to different splitting. For example, a CH adjacent to a CH2 would have coupling with the two Hs on the CH2, leading to a triplet. But if that CH is also adjacent to another CH, it could lead to a more complex pattern.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CHO. Then, the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would have two Hs, each coupling with the CH(CH3) group, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, considering the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H is perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to two other CH2 groups, leading to coupling with four Hs (two on each side), resulting in a pentet.

Wait, but a pentet would require coupling with four neighboring Hs. If each H on CH2 is next to a CH2 group with two Hs, then each H would have coupling with two on one side and two on the other, but how does that translate into splitting?

Wait, let me think about splitting in NMR. Each neighboring set of Hs splits the peak into a number of peaks equal to the number of neighboring Hs plus one. So if a H is next to a CH2 group with two Hs, it would split into a triplet. If it's next to two different CH2 groups, each with two Hs, then each coupling would be considered, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, if the H is adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs, the splitting would be each H causing a triplet, resulting in a triplet of triplets. That would be option B.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to a single CH2 group, it would be a triplet. If it's adjacent to two different sets, like a CH and a CH2, then perhaps a more complex pattern.

But the question states "the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)." So likely, it's a proton next to a carbonyl group, which is adjacent to a CH2 group.

Putting it all together: product 3's structure probably has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So each H on the central CH2 is coupled with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So the answer would be option B: triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C produces product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H singlet; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a diketone structure. The singlet at 4.79 ppm corresponds to a CH2 group flanked by two carbonyls, while the other signals correspond to protons on the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction 2**: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide likely leads to a dehydration reaction, forming product 2. This step likely produces a conjugated dienone (a diketone with a double bond), as aluminum isopropoxide can facilitate such transformations.

3. **Reaction 3**: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide cleaves the double bonds in product 2, producing product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. Thus, product 3 is expected to be a diketone with carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.

4. **¹H NMR of Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group. This proton is part of a CH2 group flanked by two carbonyls. Each hydrogen on this CH2 group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 group, resulting in a triplet of triplets as the coupling pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
