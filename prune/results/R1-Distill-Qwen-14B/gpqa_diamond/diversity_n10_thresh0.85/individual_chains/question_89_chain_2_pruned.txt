Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to give product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are given. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me think about each step.

First Step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. When a dihalide like dibromide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it's likely to undergo an elimination reaction. In such cases, especially with vicinal dihalides (two adjacent bromines), the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. Wait, but wait: 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3. Are these adjacent? No, because in the adamantane structure, the positions are in a way that 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So elimination would require that the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's anti to one of the bromines, leading to a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or perhaps 2 and 3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me imagine the adamantane structure. Adamantane is like a diamond fragment, with four carbons in a chair-like structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two opposite positions. So, when KOH is added, I think the reaction would be a dehydrohalogenation, but since it's 1,3-dibromide, perhaps two eliminations occur. Wait, but each molecule can only
