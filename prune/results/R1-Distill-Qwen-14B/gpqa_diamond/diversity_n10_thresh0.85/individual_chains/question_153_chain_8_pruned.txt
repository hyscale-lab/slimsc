Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions. There are three parts: A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to determine the major products for each and then match them with the given options.

First, the problem statement says that α-β unsaturated carbonyls are good Lewis acids and react with nucleophiles to form enolates. When a nucleophile attacks the β position, it forms a resonance-stabilized intermediate, and this is called the Michael reaction.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A.

Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the β carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. The nucleophile here is probably from the enolate of one of the compounds.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms an enolate. The enolate would attack the β position of the α,β-unsaturated ester.

The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OEt, but wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OEt, but wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, right? But the substituent is at the 3 position, so the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OEt attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, I think I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(C6H4-tolyl)-COOEt? Hmm, no. Wait, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OEt but with a p-tolyl group on the acrylate. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)COOEt? That is, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3? Or wait, perhaps I should write it as CH2=C-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOEt. No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E) configuration between the double bond.

But regardless, the key point is that the Michael acceptor here is the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So the acceptor is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The donor is the dimethyl malon
