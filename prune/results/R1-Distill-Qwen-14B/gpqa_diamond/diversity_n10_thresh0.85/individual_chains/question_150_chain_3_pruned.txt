Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Let's break this down.

First, the molecular formula given is C8H9NO. I should calculate the degree of unsaturation to understand the structure better. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, let me plug in the numbers: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2. Let's compute that: 18 -9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. 10/2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Like maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 DoU) and a couple of double bonds or rings. Wait, another possibility is a benzene ring plus a double bond and a ring, but that might be more than 5. Alternatively, benzene (3 DoU) plus a double bond (1) and a ring (1) would be 5. Or a benzene and an enal group or something similar.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm. So this suggests the compound has an aldehyde group.

Other peaks: 6.98 ppm is a doublet (2H), 6.51 ppm is a doublet (2H). Those are likely from a para-substituted aromatic ring. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Hmm, broad suggests maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents that are deshielded, or perhaps an alcohol proton, but wait, OH protons are usually broader and maybe around 1-5 ppm, but sometimes exchanged. Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group. The 3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Like an -OCH2- group or similar.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let me think: The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm, and then the aromatic region suggests a substituent on the benzene ring.

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, but maybe that's part of a larger structure.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests that those hydrogens are next to an oxygen. Like maybe a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, such as an ether or an ester. But considering the reagents used later, maybe it's an ether or a phenol group.

Wait, the starting compound is reacting with NaNO2 and HCl first. That's usually nitrous acid, which is used in diazotization reactions. So, the starting compound probably has an aromatic amine group. Oh wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, where's the amine? Let me think again.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, for an amine, the general formula for a primary amine would be RNH2, which would contribute NH2. So, the molecular formula would have at least one N from the amine. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a nitrile or an amide, but the presence of N in the formula suggests an amine.

Wait, but if the compound has an aromatic ring with an amine substituent, that might explain the reaction with NaNO2 and HCl. Diazotization typically occurs with aromatic amines, especially primary aromatic amines. So, the initial compound must have an -NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, are there any peaks that could correspond to an NH2 group? The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. If those are protons adjacent to an oxygen, but maybe they're from a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ether. Alternatively, those could be protons from a vinyl group, perhaps part of a conjugated system with an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with some substituents, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to sketch possible structures.

Suppose the molecule is a benzaldehyde derivative with two substituents on the benzene ring, and an oxygen-containing group attached. Let's say, for example, a 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde derivative. But the NMR data shows more than that.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows an aldehyde proton (9.72), two doublets in the aromatic region (6.98 and 6.51), a two-proton broad singlet (6.27), and a two-proton doublet at 3.66. So, let's think about the structure.

The two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating for 2H, suggest a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the benzene has two substituents in the para positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring: substituent at position 1 and 3? Or maybe 1 and 4? Wait, the doublets can be from coupling with adjacent protons. For a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is in opposite positions, so each substituent's protons would be in a doublet pattern. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in positions that cause the coupling.

Wait, another possibility: the aromatic region could be from two separate benzene rings. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation again. Five DoU. Benzene has three DoU, so if there's another ring or a double bond, that would account for the rest. Alternatively, a benzene ring, a double bond, and an aldehyde group (which itself is a double bond). Let me see: benzene (3) + aldehyde (1) + double bond (1) would give five. So that's possible.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at
