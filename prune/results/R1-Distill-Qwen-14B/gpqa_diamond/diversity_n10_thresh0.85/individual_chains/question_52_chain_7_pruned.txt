Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down what I know.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, and how this ratio changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

Wait, the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels... Oh right, that's the Boltzmann equation. The ratio depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels. The formula is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy.

So the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Let me calculate the energy difference between the levels. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Hmm, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But I probably need this in terms of eV because the Boltzmann factor uses energy in eV compared to k (Boltzmann's constant) which is 8.617e-5 eV/K. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the energy difference in terms of k*T.

Wait, let's think in terms of the thermal energy. The term in the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k*T), so I can compute it as (hc)/(λ k T). Let me write that as (hc)/(λ k T).

So the exponent is (hc)/(λ k T) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 8.617e-5 * T)

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 8.617e-5 eV/K * T = 1.448e-7 *8.617e-5 T = 1.244e-11 T eV·m.

Wait, wait, units might get a bit messy, but perhaps I can compute it numerically.

Wait, let's plug in numbers. Let me compute (h c) / (lambda k) first, that would be (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 8.617e-5). Let's compute this without the T yet.

So,

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

1.448e-7 *8.617e-5 = 1.448 *8.617 = approx 12.44, so 12.44e-12.

So 1.9878e-25 / (12.44e-12) = approx 1.598e-14. But wait, that's (h c)/(lambda k) = 1.598e-14 * (1/K) because k is per K. So when we multiply by 1/T, the exponent is (h c)/(lambda k T) = (1.598e-14 / T) [in K^-1? Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio (E2-E1)/(k T) in terms of the wavelength.

Wait, another approach: The energy per photon E = hc/λ. The thermal energy kT is the typical energy at temperature T. So the ratio E/(kT) is (hc)/(λ k T).

So for a given temperature T, this ratio is (h c) / (λ k T). Let me compute this value for T = 6000 K and T = 5500 K.

First, calculate for T1 = 6000 K:

E/(kT) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.3806e-23 *6000)

Wait, because k is 1.3806e-23 J/K. Wait, but earlier I used 8.617e-5 eV/K which is the same as 1.3806e-23 J/K.

So:

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.3806e-23 J/K * 6000 K = 1.448e-7 * 1.3806e-23 *6e3.

Compute denominator: 1.448e-7 * 1.3806e-23 = (1.448 *1.3806)e-30 ≈ 2.001e-30. Multiply by 6e3: 2.001e-30 *6e3=1.2006e-26.

So E/(kT) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.2006e-26 ≈ 16.55.

Similarly, for T2 =5500 K:

Denominator for T=5500 is 1.448e-7 * 1.3806e-23 *5500.

Compute denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.3806e-23 =2e-30 as before. 2e-30 *5.5e3 = 1.1e-26.

So E/(kT) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.1e-26 ≈ 18.07.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1.9878e-25 divided by 1.1e-26 is about 18.07.

Wait, but wait, this ratio (E/kT) is the same as (hc)/(λ k T), which is the same as (hc)/(λ k T) = (E)/(kT). So when E is much larger than kT, the exponent is a large negative number, which would make n2 much smaller than n1, so the ratio n1/n2 would be large. But when E is smaller relative to kT, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, in this problem, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So, Teff goes down. So what's the effect on the ratio n1/n2? In the problem, it says "the ratio decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, the ratio observed is n1/n2. So when Teff is lower (5500), the ratio n1/n
