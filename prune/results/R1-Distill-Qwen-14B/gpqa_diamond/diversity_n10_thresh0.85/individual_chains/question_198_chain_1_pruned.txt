Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure it out step by step. I know it's about complex ions and stability constants, so I need to recall what I learned in my chemistry class.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're asked to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait. I think the blue dithiocyanato complex is Co(SCN)_2^2+, which is the second complex. Or is it another one? Let me think. Oh wait, no, the blue one is probably the one with two SCN ligands, which is the second complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+. Because I remember that different ligand counts give different colors. So the question is asking about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution.

Stability constants, right. These β values represent the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is for the first complex, which would be Co(SCN)^+ (since Co^2+ plus one SCN^- would give a +1 charge, as 2+ + (-1) = 1+). Then β2 is for Co(SCN)_2^0, I think. Wait, no: each SCN^- contributes a -1. So Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- gives Co(SCN)_2^0. Oh wait, but wait: Co^2+ has a +2 charge, each SCN^- is -1. So 2 SCN would bring it down to 0, so neutral. Hmm, but the stability constants are for the formation of each complex from the previous one. Oh right, each β is the formation constant for adding one SCN^- at a time.

So, the complexes are:

Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+ (β1=9)

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^0 (β2=40)

Co(SCN)_2^0 + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_3^- (β3=63)

Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_4^2- (β4=16)

Wait, but the charges would be going from +2 to +1, then to neutral, then to -1, then to -2. So each step adds another SCN^-.

So the four complexes are:

1: CoSCN^+ (charge +1)

2: Co(SCN)_2^0 (neutral)

3: Co(SCN)_3^- (charge -1)

4: Co(SCN)_4^2- (charge -2)

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN^- ligands, so that's the second complex, Co(SCN)_2^0.

We need to find the percentage of this species in the total cobalt species. The total includes all possible complexes plus the free Co^2+.

So the first step is to model the distribution of the cobalt species. The free Co^2+ and each of the four complexes.

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, so each β is the equilibrium constant for adding one SCN^- to the previous complex.

The general approach is to write the expressions for each complex's concentration in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration and the SCN^- concentration, using the β values.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x, [CoSCN^+] as y, [Co(SCN)_2^0] as z, [Co(SCN)_3^-] as w, and [Co(SCN)_4^2-] as v.

Each formation step is:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+ ; K1 = β1 =9

CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_2^0 ; K2 = β2 =40

Co(SCN)_2^0 + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_3^- ; K3=β3=63

Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_4^2- ; K4=β4=16

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species:

x + y + z + w + v = 1e-2 M

But I think a better approach is to express each of the complex concentrations in terms of the previous one and the β's and [SCN^-].

So for the first complex:

y = β1 * x * [SCN^-]

z = β2 * y * [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 * x * [SCN^-]^2

w = β3 * z * [SCN^-] = β3 * β2 * β1 * x * [SCN^-]^3

v = β4 * w * [SCN^-] = β4 * β3 * β2 * β1 * x * [SCN^-]^4

So, each subsequent complex is the product of all previous β's and the current [SCN^-] raised to the number of steps.

But wait, I think each β is for adding another SCN, so each time you multiply by β and [SCN^-].

So, in terms of x, each species can be written as:

y = β1 [SCN^-] x

z = β2 [SCN^-] y = β2 [SCN^-] (β1 [SCN^-] x) ) = β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 x

Similarly, w = β3 [SCN^-] z = β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 x

v = β4 [SCN^-] w = β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 x

Now, the total concentration is x + y + z + w + v =c=1e-2 M.

So substituting:

x + (β1 [SCN] x) + (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 x) + (β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 x) + (β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 x) = c

We can factor out x:

x [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ] = c

So x = c / [ 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ]

Then, each species can be found by multiplying x by their respective terms.

But wait, the problem gives [SCN^-] as 0.1 M. Let me plug that in.

[SCN] = 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term:

First, compute the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4

Let me compute each term step by step.

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term3: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 → 9*40=360; 0.1^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01=3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 → Let's compute 9*40=360; 360 *63=22680; (0.1)^3=0.001 → 22680 *0.001=22.68

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 =9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4 → Let's compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; (0.1)^4=0.0001 → 362880 * 0.0001=36.288

Now sum all terms:

Term1: 1

Term2: 0.9 → sum so far 1.9

Term3: 3.6 → sum 5.5

Term4:22.68 → sum 28.18

Term5:36.288 → sum 64.468

So denominator = 64.468.

Then x = c / denominator → c=1e-2 M → x= (0.01) / 64.468 ≈ 0.00015515 M.

Wait, let me compute 0.01 / 64.468: 64.468 ≈ 64.468 → 0.01 /64.468 = approximately 1.5515e-4 M.

Now, let's compute each cobalt species:

z is the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^0, which is the second term (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 x).

Wait, no. Wait, the second complex is z, which is β1 β2 [SCN]^2 x.

So z = β1 β2 [SCN]^2 x.

We already have β1=9, β2=40, [SCN]=0.1.

So β1 β2 = 360.

[SCN]^2 = 0.01.

x=1.5515e-4.

So z=360 *0.01 *1.5515e-4 =360 *0.01=3.6; 3.6 *1.5515e-4 = approx 5.585e-5 M.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute each term more precisely.

Alternatively, each species can be expressed as a fraction of x, and then sum up all the fractions to get the percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the fraction of each species relative to x, and then sum them all with the denominator to find the percentage.

Alternatively, since all the species are expressed as multiples of x, the fractions can be found by dividing each term by the denominator.

Wait, because the denominator is 64.468, which is the sum of 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

So the fraction for each species is:

Fraction of Co^2+ = 1 / 64.468 ≈ 0.015515 → 1.5515%

Fraction of CoSCN^+ = 0.9 /64.468 ≈0.01396 → ~1.396%

Fraction of Co(SCN)_2^0 =3.6 /64.468 → 3.6/64.468 ≈0.05558 → 5.558%

Fraction of Co(SCN)_3^- =22.68 /64.468 → ~0.3517 → 35.17%

Fraction of Co(SCN)_4^2- =36.288 /64.468 → ~0.5628 →56.28%

So wait, the fractions are:

Co^2+ → ~1.55%

CoSCN^+ → ~1.40%

Co(SCN)_2^0 → ~5.56%

Co(SCN)_3^- → ~35.17%

Co(SCN)_4^2- → ~56.28%

So the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^0. That's about 5.56% as per this calculation. But wait, none of the options are that. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the β4? Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the β4 is 16. So in term5, which is β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Compute β1β2β3β4: 9 *40 =360; 360 *63=22680; 22680 *16=362880. [SCN]^4 is (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288. That's correct.

Hmm, but in the fractions, the dithiocyanate is about 5.56%, but that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in which complex is which.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is not the second
