Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait. The non-rigid rotor model is also called the rotational model where the bond isn't perfectly rigid, so it can stretch a bit. But wait, the problem mentions that the molecule is in its fundamental state. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

The molecule is made of elements X and Y with masses Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is asking about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state. So, the photon must supply the right amount of energy to move it to the next state.

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels probably involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's usually a transition between vibrational and rotational energy levels. So I think the photon's energy should match the energy difference between the initial and next state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next lowest energy state would either be a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But the question says it switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition is lower in energy? Well, vibrational energy levels have larger spacing than rotational ones, I think. Because vibrational energy is quantized as (n + 1/2) ħw, while rotational is quantized as (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So, the energy difference for the first vibrational transition (n=0 to n=1) would be ħw. The first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) would be something else. Wait, but for the rotational state, the energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So from J=0 to J=1, the energy change is B*(1*2) - B*(0*1) = 2B. So the energy needed for rotation is 2B.

But which is smaller, the rotational energy change or the vibrational? Because if the vibrational transition requires ħw, and the rotational requires 2B, whichever is smaller would be the next possible state.

But let's calculate both to see.

First, I need to find the rotational constant B. B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², with μ being the reduced mass of the two atoms.

So, μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let's compute that. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx + My =22. So μ = (20*2)/22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I need to convert this into kilograms because the standard units for physics are in SI. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 20/11 is about 1.818. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (1.818 * 1.6605) is around 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me do it more accurately. 20/11 is approximately 1.8181818. Multiply by 1.6605e-27: 1.8181818 * 1.6605 = let's see. 1.818 * 1.66 is about (1.818 * 1.66) = approx 3.016, but let me compute 1.818 * 1.6605:

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 1.818 * 1.6 = 2.9088, 1.818 * 0.0605≈ 0.110, so total approx 3.0188. So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, but wait. The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2I). ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So B = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2075e-46 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 = approx 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2075e-46 = 2.415e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) ≈ (1.112 / 2.415) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, that's B. Then the rotational energy change from J=0 to J=1 is 2B, so 2 * 4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy change is ħw. Let's compute that.

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So energy delta E_vibr = ħw = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Comparing the two: 9.2e-23 J (rotational) and 4.2e-20 J (vibrational). So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about momentum. Because the photon's energy is related to its momentum. E_photon = p * c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, no, the energy of a photon is E = pc, because for photons, E = pc since their mass is zero. So p = E/(c).

So p_photon = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ (9.2e-23) / 3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

But looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, but my calculation is giving about 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns, since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s.

But none of the options are even close. Hmm, that probably means I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Because the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which includes both rotation and vibration, but perhaps the transition isn't a pure rotation or pure vibration, but a combination.

Wait, wait. Oh, perhaps the model is the Morse potential or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy levels as a combination of rotation and vibration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which has lower energy?

Wait, I calculated that the rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) requires 9.2e-23 J, while the vibrational (v=0 to v=1) requires 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the photon would need to supply 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition where the molecule goes to the next state, which is the first excited state. The first excited state would be either J=1 or v=1. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the lower energy transition. So the photon's energy should be 9.2e-23 J, which would correspond to momentum p = E_photon / c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.066e-31 kg m/s = 3.066e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close to that. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the model is different. Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model treats the molecule as a three-dimensional rotor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the rigid rotor model, but that wouldn't involve vibration. Wait, the question says quantum rotation-vibration model, so it must involve both.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total energy levels, which combine both rotational and vibrational contributions. So the total energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but the question is about the energy required to excite the molecule to the next state. So the next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy higher than the current state.

So let's think: the ground state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible state could be either the first vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (n=0, J=1). Which one requires less energy?

Earlier calculation suggested that the rotational transition is lower. So the photon's energy should be delta E_rot = 2B. So delta E = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't have anything close to 3e-31 Ns. Let me re-express 3.066e-31 Ns into scientific notation. Wait, 3.066e-31 is 3.066 x 10^-31 Ns. But the options are in the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27. So three orders of magnitude higher. Hmm.

Wait, did I miscalculate B? Let me check the calculation again.

Compute μ: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute: 1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute this accurately.

1.8 * 1.66 is 2.988. 0.018 * 1.6605 is approx 0.0299. So total is about 3.0179. So μ ≈ 3.0179e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms. 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. I = μ R² = 3.0179e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.0179e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.20716e-46 kg m².

B = ħ² / (2 I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.20716e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx (1.05457)^2 = 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.20716e-46 = 2.41432e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.41432e-46 = approx (1.112/2.41432) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.41432 ≈ 0.46. So B ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, but 4.6e-23 J is the value of B. So delta E for J=0 to J=1 is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but then the energy of the photon must match this. So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

But since E_photon = p_photon * c, then p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are much larger: smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Which is about 1e-28. So I'm three orders of magnitude off. Hmm. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the vibrational transition instead. Because maybe the next state is the vibrational first state, which would have higher energy. So if the molecule is in the ground state, and the next state is the first vibrational state, which is higher energy than the first rotational state. But wait, earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one. So why would the photon need to supply more energy?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both rotation and vibration. Like, from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), or (v=1, J=0). But no, the question says the next state with the LOWEST possible energy. So the transition with the least energy would be the first possible one.

So the photon's energy must be the lower of the two possible delta E's. So the rotational delta E is lower, so the photon's energy is 2B. But according to my calculation, that leads to a momentum of about 3e-31, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recheck the B calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me go step by step.

Compute I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.8181818 amu.

Each amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.8181818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.8181818 ≈ 1.8182. 1.8182 * 1.6605 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1.8182 * 1.6605:

1.8182 * 1.6 = 2.90912

1.8182 * 0.0605 = approx 0.1100 (because 1.8182 * 0.06 = 0.109092; 1.8182 *0.0005=0.000909, so 0.109092+0.000909≈0.110).

So total μ ≈ 2.90912 + 0.110 = 3.01912e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.01912e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01912e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207648e-46 kg m².

Now, B = (ħ^2) / (2 I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207648e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112. So 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.207648e-46 = 2.415296e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.415296e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415296) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.415 ≈ 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J = 4.6e-23 J.

So delta E for J=0 → J=1 is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E / c.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are about 1e-27, which is 1e4 times larger. Hmm. I must be missing a factor here.

Wait, did I mix up energy levels? Oh wait, perhaps the model is considering the energy as a combination of both rotational and vibrational. Or perhaps the question is considering the transition
