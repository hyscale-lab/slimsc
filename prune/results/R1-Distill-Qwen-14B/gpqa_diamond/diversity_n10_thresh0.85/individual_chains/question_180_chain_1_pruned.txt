Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, right. So energy in a system of charges... I remember that when you have multiple charges, the potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions one by one. Since the problem mentions an isolated system, I think we're looking for the electrostatic potential energy here.

Wait, but which charges are we considering? The 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the fixed charge is at point P, and the others are all at a distance of 2 meters away.

Since all the charges are the same, each is 2e. So, the total charge for each is 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C? Wait, no. Wait, 2e just means twice the elementary charge, so 2 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-19 C each. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2e is 2 times e, where e is 1.
