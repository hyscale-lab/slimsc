Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and figure out what's going on.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. So, when the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does having spots lower the effective temperature? Oh right, because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so when a significant portion is covered, the overall emission decreases, making the star appear cooler.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Hmm. The ratio in question is the population ratio of two energy levels. The Boltzmann equation tells us that the ratio of populations (n_i / n_j) is equal to (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy difference.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n1/n2 (assuming level 1 is lower energy than level 2) would change how?

Wait, no, the ratio they're looking at is the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels. Let's say level 1 is lower energy than level 2. The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Because E2 > E1, the exponential term would decrease as T decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which matches what the question says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the original ratio (no spots) is higher than when spots are present.

So the ratio when no spots: R0 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T0) ), where T0 is 6000 K.

Ratio when spots: R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T1) ), T1 is 5500 K.

The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes. So factor is R0/R1.

Wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots. So R0 / R1.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T0)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ) ].

The g factors cancel out. So that's exp(ΔE/(k T0) - ΔE
