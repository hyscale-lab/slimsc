Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix that's equal to c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π). And S is given as a matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So, let me write down what Ay looks like.

So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So multiplying by c, which is h/(4π), the matrix Ay becomes (h/(4π)) * S. So:

Ay = [ 0      (-i h)/(4π) ]
      [ (i h)/(4π)   0    ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a    ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part:

The first term is a squared. The second part is [ (-i)(i) h²/(4π)^2 ].

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (1) * h²/(4π)^2.

So the determinant is a² - (h²/(4π)^2) = 0.

Setting this equal to zero for the eigenvalues:

a² = (h/(4π))²

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π). But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, the determinant equation is a² - (h/(4π))² = 0. So a^2 = (h/(4π))², so a = ± h/(4π). Yes, that's right. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the real parts are these values, and the imaginary parts are zero. Because the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the imaginary parts would be zero.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't match either. Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about the eigenvalues. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, I might have messed up the matrix. Let me re-examine the setup. Oh wait, wait a second. The matrix S is given, and Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π). So S itself is the matrix I wrote.

Wait, but when I compute the determinant, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

The matrix Ay is:

[ 0      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0    ]

So the characteristic equation is:

| Ay - a I | = 0

Which becomes:

| -a        (-i h)/(4π) |
| (i h)/(4π)   -a      | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Multiplying the off-diagonal terms: (-i)(i) = (-i²) = 1, because i² is -1. So [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = (1) * h²/(4π)^2.

So the determinant is
