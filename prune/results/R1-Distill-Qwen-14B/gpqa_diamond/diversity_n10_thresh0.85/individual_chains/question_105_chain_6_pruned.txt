Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and how their brightness variations compare to those caused by an exoplanet.

Alright, the star has the same radius as the Sun. Oh wait, but one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So when the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness changes. But the kicker is that this setup can look like an exoplanet causing the same light curve variations. The question is asking what radius an exoplanet would need to have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, so normally, when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness is what we detect. But in this case, the star's spots are causing a variation, and we want to find the planet radius that would mimic that.

Let me think about how these signals compare. I remember that the brightness variation depends on the blocked area and the temperature difference. Oh right, the star's brightness isn't uniform because the spots are cooler. So when a spot is in front, it blocks more light (since it's darker) than a planet of the same size would, because the planet would just block the star's light uniformly.

Wait, so the effective area blocked by the spots is more complicated. The filling factor is 20%, but each spot is cooler. So the change in brightness is due to both the area covered and the temperature difference between the spot and the rest of the star.

The problem says that the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. So the spots emit less light than the surrounding.

Now, when the star isn't covered by spots, what would cause a similar brightness variation? An exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So we need to compute the relative brightness dip caused by the spots and set that equal to the dip caused by the planet.

The brightness variation due to the planet would be (R_planet / R_star)^2 times the star's brightness, as the planet blocks that part. But for the spots, it's a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible hemisphere, the overall brightness is lower because the spots don't emit as much as the surrounding.

Wait, no. The star's brightness is being modulated as the spots rotate into and out of view. So when a spot is in front, it's blocking a part of the star, but since it's a dark spot, the observed brightness decreases. Alternatively, when the spot is on the backside (from our view), it doesn't affect the brightness as much.

Wait, no. Wait, when a spot is on the hemisphere facing us, it's part of the star's surface; but since it's cooler, it contributes less to the total brightness. So the overall brightness change would be the difference between the star's normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are visible.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about how to compute the flux variation.

The star's total flux without any spots is F = σTeff^4 * 4πRstar², where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But when a spot is visible, it's contributing less flux. The spot area is A_spot = filling factor * (πRstar² * (1/2)) because only one hemisphere is covered. Wait, wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So each hemisphere is half the star's surface area. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πRstar²?) Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So since the star is a sphere, each hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR².

Hmm, maybe I should model it as the total flux when the spots are
