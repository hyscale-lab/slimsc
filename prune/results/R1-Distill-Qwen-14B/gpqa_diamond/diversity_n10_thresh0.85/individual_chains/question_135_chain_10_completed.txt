Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let's see what the question is about. It's about the decay of a boson X, right? The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I need to focus on the decay possibilities.

First, I remember that when a particle decays, the decay products must have a combined mass that's less than the mass of the decaying particle. Because of energy and conservation laws, the X boson can decay into particles whose rest mass is less than 6 GeV each. Also, since X is a boson here, I should think about whether it's a scalar or something else, but I think the main point is about the possible fermion pairs it can decay into.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that's a Yukawa-like interaction, but perhaps the details of λ and ψ_f aren't directly important for the decay kinematics. The key is the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into.

So the possible decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs. The question is which of these pairs have masses such that 2m < 6 GeV, where m is the mass of each fermion in the pair.

Let me list the fermion masses I know. Quarks come in different flavors with varying masses. But wait, the actual masses might be tricky because quarks are confined, but for decay purposes, we consider their current masses. Let me recall:

- Up-type quarks: u, c, t. Their masses are about: u is around 2 MeV, c about 1.2 GeV, t is 173 GeV (but wait, X is 6 GeV, so t is way too heavy. 173 GeV is way bigger than 6 GeV, so t can't be a decay product. So no top quarks here.

- Down-type quarks: d, s, b. Their masses: d is about 4-5 MeV, s is around 95-100 MeV, b is about 4.5 GeV. So 2m for b would be ~9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b and anti-b because that would require 2*4.5=9 GeV, which X only has 6 GeV. So b is out.

- Leptons: e, mu, tau. The masses are: e is 0.511 MeV, mu about 105.7 MeV, tau about 1.78 GeV. So for tau, 2m would be about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

So let's go through each fermion:

Electron: 2m_e ~1 MeV, way below 6 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.

Mu: 2m_mu ~0.211 GeV, which is 211 MeV, also allowed.

Tau: 2m_tau ~3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV, so allowed.

For quarks:

u quark: 2m_u ~4 MeV, allowed.

d quark: 2m_d ~8-10 MeV, allowed.

s quark: 2m_s ~190 MeV, allowed.

c quark: 2m_c ~2.4 GeV, which is less than 6, so allowed.

b quark: as before, 9 GeV, too big. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Top is way bigger, so no.

So possible decay products are:

c c-bar: 2.4 GeV <6 GeV. Okay.

s s-bar: 0.19 GeV <6. Okay.

u u-bar: 0.004 GeV, okay.

d d-bar: 0.008 GeV, okay.

tau+ tau-: 3.56 GeV <6, okay.

e+ e-: 1 MeV, okay.

mu+ mu-: 0.211 GeV, okay.

But wait, looking at the options, which ones include these?

Option A: X→b b-bar,... which is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all allowed except for b. So B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is too heavy, so C is invalid.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So no c, but has b which isn't allowed. So D's wrong.

But wait, the quark masses: Wait, the current masses. For the c quark, I think the mass is around 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 2m_c would be about 2.4-3 GeV, which is under 6 GeV, so c is allowed.

So in the allowed decay products, c c-bar is possible.

Looking at the options:

Option B has c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So that's all allowed.

What about option D? It includes b, which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all allowed fermions except for t and b. So B is correct.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the possible fermion-antifermion pairs it can decay into. The decay products must satisfy the condition \( 2m < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m \) is the mass of each fermion in the pair. Additionally, the interaction Lagrangian suggests that \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair allowed by the Lagrangian.

### Fermion Masses and Decay Products:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \): \( 2m_u \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( d \): \( 2m_d \approx 8-10 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( s \): \( 2m_s \approx 190 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( c \): \( 2m_c \approx 2.4 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( b \): \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (exceeds 6 GeV).
   - \( t \): \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (far exceeds 6 GeV).

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2m_e \approx 1 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.211 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Invalid**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \). All these decay products are allowed. **Valid**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Invalid**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Invalid**.

### Conclusion:
The only kinematically allowed decay products of \( X \) are \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
