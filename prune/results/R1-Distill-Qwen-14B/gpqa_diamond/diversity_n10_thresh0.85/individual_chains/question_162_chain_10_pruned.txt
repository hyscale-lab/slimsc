Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like in hyperbolic geometry.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks like it's in two dimensions, with coordinates x and y. So the metric is conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, I'm trying to think about what this represents. The denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so that's 4 minus the squared distance from the origin in 2D, right? So the region where 4 - (x² + y²) > 0 is where the metric is defined, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, making the metric singular or imaginary.

So the domain of this metric is the set of points where x² + y² < 4. That's a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But this is a two-dimensional surface, so it's a disk of radius 2. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh, pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry, right? The metric might represent a hyperbolic space, but here it's expressed in terms of x and y.

Wait, maybe the metric is that of a hyperbolic plane. The hyperbolic plane has
