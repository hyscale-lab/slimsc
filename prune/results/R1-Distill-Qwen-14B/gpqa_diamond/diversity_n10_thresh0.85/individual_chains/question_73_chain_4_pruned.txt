Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the velocities, right? Because at high speeds, you can't just do v = u - w or something like that. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when adding two velocities is (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's velocity?

Wait no, wait. If A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then the relative speed of B with respect to A would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that. The numerator is (0.5 -0.6)*c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c²) = 1 -0.3=0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. Oh but relative speed is magnitude, so it's 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c, which matches option C and D's relative speed of 0.14c.

Now the total energy part. The options vary between 4.96 mc², 5.96 mc², 5 mc², etc.

In relativity, the total energy of a moving object is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the system's total energy is the sum of the energies of both astronauts.

First astronaut's energy: E1= gamma1 * (2m) c². Gamma1 is 1/s
