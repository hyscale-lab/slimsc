Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me read the question again.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the conductor's center. Point P is also at a distance l from the cavity's center, and l is greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the conductor is uncharged initially. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, how does that affect the conductor's charges? I remember that in electrostatics, charges in a conductor redistribute themselves.

So, when you have a conductor with a cavity, and you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface gets induced charges. If the cavity is conducting, the charges would rearrange, but wait, the cavity here is a cavity in the conductor, but the conductor itself is a conductor, so the cavity's material is different. Wait, no, the conductor is the outer sphere, and the cavity is hollow inside. So the cavity is empty except for the charge q.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will develop an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material is a conductor, so charges can move. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so when the +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But the total charge of the conductor was zero, so the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface's -q.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think. The conductor as a whole is uncharged. So initially, all charges are neutral. When I place +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor's total charge was zero, the outer surface must have +q to balance. So the conductor's total charge is zero: inner surface -q, outer surface +q.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface is outside the cavity, and the point P is outside the conductor. So when I'm at point P, the electric field should be due to the charges outside, right? Because inside the conductor, the field is zero, and outside it behaves as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The conductor is originally neutral. When I put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q so that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

But wait, that's only if the cavity is isolated and the conductor is neutral. So the conductor's net charge is zero, but the inner surface has -q and the outer +q.

So when we're looking at a point outside the conductor (radius L > R), the electric field is
