Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my studies that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring, where F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, which means we have to consider the effects of special relativity, right?

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are all different formulas involving k, A, m, and c, the speed of light. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the potential energy U is (1/2)k A^2, and that would equal (1/2)m v_max^2. Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so I can't use that directly. So option C is probably not the correct answer.

Relativistically, things get more complicated because the mass increases with velocity. The total energy of the system is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator would still be (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)m v² anymore. Instead, it's (gamma - 1) m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of potential and kinetic energies. At maximum displacement (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At maximum speed, which occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So setting the potential energy at x=A equal to the kinetic energy at x=0.

Wait, but wait, is that right? Because in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes, but in the relativistic case, the velocity is maximum when kinetic energy is maximum. Hmm, actually, no—when x is zero, the potential is zero, but the kinetic energy is maximum. So yes, at x=A, the potential is maximum, and velocity is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)k A², which equals the kinetic energy at x=0, which is (gamma -1) m c².

So setting them equal: (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But wait, I think I'm missing something. The potential energy in a relativistic oscillator might not be the same as in the non-relativistic case. Oh wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -k x, which is the same as the non-relativistic case. But the equation of motion would involve relativistic momentum. Hmm, maybe the potential energy expression is the same, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but the potential energy is classical. So, the total energy E is (gamma) m c² = (1/2) k A² + m c². Because at maximum displacement, velocity is zero, but the mass is at rest in terms of kinetic energy, but the potential energy is (1/2)k A². Wait, no, the rest mass energy is m c², so the total energy would be m c² plus the potential energy. Or is it?

Wait, no. Let me think. The total energy when the mass is at x=A is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy. So E = m c² + (1/2) k A².

At x=0, the mass is moving the fastest, so all the energy is in kinetic form. The kinetic energy is E_kin = (gamma - 1) m c². So E = m c² + (1/2)k A² = gamma m c².

So setting gamma = [m c² + (1/2)k A²] / m c².

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so I can solve for v_max from gamma.

Let me write that:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = [ (m c²) + (k A² / 2) ] / (m c²) ) ? No, wait, E = m c² + (1/2)k A². So gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that can't be right because the units would be inconsistent. Let me check the units. k has units of N/m, which is kg/s². So k A² has units of kg m²/s², which is joules (energy). So (k A²)/(2 m c²) is dimensionless, which is correct.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ?

Wait, let me compute:

gamma = [m c² + (1/2) k A² ] / (m c²) ) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ].

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, gamma must be greater than 1, which it is because k A² is positive. So now, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + beta', where beta' is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Now, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, we can write:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote beta = v/c. So, 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + beta', where beta' = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

1/(1 - beta²) = [1 + beta']^2.

Multiply both sides by (1 - beta²):

1 = [1 + beta']² (1 - beta²).

Let me expand the right-hand side.

(1 + 2 beta' + beta'^2) (1 - beta²) = 1 + 2 beta' + beta'^2 - beta² - 2 beta'^2 beta² - beta^4 beta'^2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write it as:

1 = (1 + beta')² (1 - beta²).

Let me multiply it out:

(1+beta')²(1 - beta²) = (1 + 2 beta' + beta'^2)(1 - beta^2) 

= 1*(1 - beta^2) + 2 beta' (1 - beta^2) + beta'^2 (1 - beta^2)

= 1 - beta^2 + 2 beta' (1 - beta^2) + beta'^2 (1 - beta^2).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to solve for beta.

Let me write the equation:

1/(1 - beta^2) = (1 + beta')^2.

So, 1 - beta^2 = 1/(1 + beta')^2.

Rearranged:

beta^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + beta')^2.

Which can be written as:

beta^2 = [ (1 + beta')^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta')^2.

Simplify numerator:

(1 + 2 beta' + beta'^2) - 1 = 2 beta' + beta'^2.

So,

beta^2 = (2 beta' + beta'^2) / (1 + beta')^2.

Factor numerator:

beta'^2 + 2 beta' = beta'(beta' + 2).

Denominator is (1 + beta')^2.

So,

beta^2 = [ beta' (beta' + 2) ] / (1 + beta')^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this differently. Let me factor out beta' from numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me see. Let me compute beta' again. beta' is (k A^2) / (2 m c²). Let's denote beta' as something else for simplicity, say, let me call it b.

So, b = k A²/(2 m c²).

So, beta^2 = [ b (b + 2) ] / (1 + b)^2.

Wait, that's [b(b + 2)] / (1 + b)^2.

Let me compute numerator: b² + 2b.

Denominator: (1 + b)^2 = 1 + 2b + b².

So, beta^2 = (b² + 2b) / (1 + 2b + b²) = [b (b + 2)] / (1 + b)^2.

Hmm, can this be simplified?

Alternatively, let me factor numerator as b (b + 2) = b (b + 2).

Denominator: (1 + b)^2 = (1 + b)(1 + b).

So, can I write beta^2 as [b (b + 2)] / [ (1 + b)^2 ].

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator as (b + 1)^2 - 1:

Because (b+1)^2 = b² + 2b +1.

So, b² + 2b = (b+1)^2 -1.

So,

beta^2 = [ (b+1)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + b)^2.

= [ (b+1)^2 / (1 + b)^2 ) ] - [ 1/(1 + b)^2 ]

= 1 - [1/(1 + b)^2 ].

So,

beta^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2.

Then,

beta = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 ).

But wait, that's getting complicated. Let me plug back in b:

beta = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 ), where b = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/(1 + b)^2 is 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]^2.

Wait, so:

beta = sqrt( 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ] )

= sqrt( [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² - 1 ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² )

Hmm, let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

(1 + b)^2 -1 = 1 + 2b + b² -1 = 2b + b² = b (2 + b).

So,

beta = sqrt( [ b (2 + b) ] / (1 + b)^2 )

= sqrt( [b (2 + b) ] ) / (1 + b )

But I don't think that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to gamma = 1 + b, where b is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

And gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), so:

1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Let me square both sides:

1 / (1 - beta^2) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)]^2.

So,

1 - beta^2 = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)]^2.

Then,

beta^2 = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))^2 ].

That's another way to write it.

So, beta = v/c = sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))² ] )

Hmm, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the sqrt.

1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ]

Which is what I have for beta^2.

So, beta is sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ] )

So, v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Which matches option D.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D says: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ] )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Alternatively, let's look at the other options.

Option A has sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ) )^2 )

Hmm, denominator inside the square is 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m), which doesn't look like our expression. Because our denominator is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²). So probably not.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )) . The denominator inside is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²). So ... That's different. Wait, that's 1/(1 - x), not 1/(1 +x)^2. So that's not matching.

Option C is the non-relativistic case, which we already dismissed.

So the correct answer must be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system's energy dynamics. 

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential energy, given by \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At maximum speed (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic energy, which is expressed relativistically as \( E_{\text{kin}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:
\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]
Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]
Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), substituting this into the equation gives:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]
Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]
\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2m}\right)^2}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the denominator inside the square root does not match the derived expression, and the term \( \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) lacks the factor \( c^2 \) in the denominator.

- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\left(1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the denominator inside the square root is \( 1 - \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), which does not match the derived expression, and the structure of the equation is inconsistent.

- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
  This is the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects, so it is incorrect.

- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}} \)  
  This matches the derived expression exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
