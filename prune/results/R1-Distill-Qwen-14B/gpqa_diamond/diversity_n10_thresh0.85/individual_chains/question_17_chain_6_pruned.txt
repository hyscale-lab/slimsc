Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, stochiometric... I think that means it's in a 1:1 ratio, right? So one calcium ion to one EDTA molecule. So Ca-EDTA would be CaY^2- or something like that.

And the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. Oh, right, K is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. High K means the complex is very stable, so the ions tend to form it.

So the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. I remember that when you have a complex ion in solution, you can't just assume all the calcium is free. Most of it is tied up in the complex, especially if the K is large.

I think the formation reaction is something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or CaY^2-). The K for this would be Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, EDTA is usually in a different form in solution because of pH. Oh, but the question says pH is ideal, so I guess we don't have to worry about that. The problem assumes that all the EDTA is in the form that can react with Ca, which is probably the Y^4- form.

So, we have a solution where the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-], is 0.02 M. Let's call that 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as C, which is 0.02 M.

The assumption is that the complex dissociates a bit into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-: CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

We can model this using the formation constant. The dissociation would have a K equal to 1/Kf, since K for formation is Kf. Because K for dissociation is 1/Kf.

So, the dissociation equation's K is Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

The expression for Kd would be [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = Kd.

But wait, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then in solution, some of it dissociates. Let's say the change is x. So [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, because Kd is so small (since Kf is 5e10, Kd is tiny, so x is going to be much smaller than 0.02).

So plugging into the Kd expression: (x)(x) / 0.02 ≈ Kd.

Which is
