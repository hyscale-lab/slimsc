Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not entirely sure what that means. Oh right, I remember that the interaction term usually tells us which particles interact with each other. So here, X is interacting with various fermions. The ψ_f probably represents different fermion fields. The term seems to involve Yukawa-type interactions, where the boson couples to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about the possible decay channels of X at the lowest order. Decay channels depend on the available energy and the interactions allowed by the Lagrangian.

First, I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into. Since the Lagrangian includes X coupling to ψ_f, the possible fermions are those for which this interaction is present. The term fψ̄ (something) ψf suggests that the fermion f is in the loop or directly interacting, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, more accurately, the Lagrangian term would imply that X couples to fermions f. So, the possible decay products would be pairs of these fermions.

Wait, but looking at the given Lagrangian, the structure is -λ_f f ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I should parse this more carefully. So, the term looks like λ_f times f times the product of the fermion fields ψ̄ and ψ, multiplied by (v + X). So perhaps X is interacting with the fermion f with a coupling proportional to λ_f. That would mean that X can decay into any fermion f and its antiparticle, provided the energy is sufficient.

So, the possible decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than the mass of X, which is 6 GeV.

Now, what are the possible fermions that X can decay into? The fermions in the Standard Model include quarks (u, d, c, s, t, b) and leptons (e, mu, tau, and their neutrinos).

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are present in the model. Oh, but since the Lagrangian has the term, I think it's safe to assume that X couples to all the fermions in the Standard Model, unless otherwise stated. So the possible decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pair where their combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait no, that's not quite right. The mass of the boson being 6 GeV, so when it decays, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But more accurately, the rest mass of the boson must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products for the decay to be kinematically allowed.

But considering that particles can have kinetic
