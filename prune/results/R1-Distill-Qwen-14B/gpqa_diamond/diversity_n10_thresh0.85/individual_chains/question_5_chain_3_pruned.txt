Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the operator is given as P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the first thing I remember is that in quantum mechanics, operators often correspond to observables like momentum or spin. Oh wait, spin operators! Oh right, the Pauli matrices are related to spin in different directions. So P must be a spin operator for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle.

The problem gives the components of the operator P_x, P_y, P_z. Let me note them down:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] — that's the Pauli X matrix.
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]] — Pauli Y matrix.
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] — Pauli Z matrix.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so it's arbitrary but lies in that plane. So the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, φ would be 0 or π? Wait, no, any angle around the y-axis, but since it's in x-z, the direction is (x, 0, z). So, more accurately, n can be expressed in spherical coordinates with φ=0 or φ=π, I think. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the spin operator along an arbitrary direction.

The general spin operator along a direction n is given by P = (P · n) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, that's if it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, actually, the direction vector n is a unit vector. So if it's in the x-z plane, it can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no that's not correct. Let me think again about spherical coordinates.

In spherical coordinates, a point on the sphere is given by (r, θ, φ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So a direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0, because that's along the x-axis direction when θ=0. Wait, but if direction is arbitrary in x-z, φ could vary, but for a direction in x-z plane, the angle φ can be anything, but n_y is zero. So n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ) — wait no, that makes the y-component zero. Wait, if n is in x-z plane, then n_y is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z),
