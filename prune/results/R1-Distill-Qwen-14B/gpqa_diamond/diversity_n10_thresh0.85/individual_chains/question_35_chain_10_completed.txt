Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, which is given as c·S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right?

Wait, the matrix S is given. The first row is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So S looks like:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So Ay is c times this matrix. Since c is h/(4π), that's a constant factor. Let me write out what Ay looks like.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, but I'm trying to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, eigenvalues are scalars a such that Ay φ = a φ.

So I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me compute the matrix (Ay - a I):

= [ [-a , (h/(4π)) (-i) ],
    [ (h/(4π)) i , -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (h/(4π)) (-i) ] * [ (h/(4π)) i ] = a² - [ (h²/(4π)²) (-i)(i) ]

Wait, because (-i)*i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (h²/(4π)^2) * 1.

So determinant is a² - (h²/(4π)^2) = 0.

So a² = (h²)/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4π). Hmm, wait no, because square root of (h/(4π))² is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are a = ± (h/(4π)) * something?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me do the calculation again. The determinant is:

det = [ (-a)(-a) ) ] - [ ( (h/(4π)) (-i) ) * ( (h/(4π)) i ) ]

Which is a² - (h²/(4π)^2) * (-i * i )

But (-i)*i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1, so the second term is (h²/(4π)^2) * 1. So det = a² - (h²/(4π)^2) = 0.

So a² = (h^2)/(16 π²), because (4π)^2 is 16 π². Hmm wait, no. (4π)^2 is 16 π², so (h/(4π)) squared is h²/(16 π²).

So a² = h²/(16 π²), so a = h/(4π) * sqrt(1), but wait, the equation is a² = (h^2)/(16 π²), so a would be ± h/(4π) * 1/2? Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π). Oh wait, no, (h/(4π)) squared is h²/(16 π²). So a squared is h²/(16 π²), so a is ± h/(4π). Wait, no, wait. Wait, h/(4π) squared is h²/(16 π²). So a squared is equal to that, which means a is ± h/(4π).

Wait, no. Because if a² = (h/(4π))², then a is h/(4π) or -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, I'm seeing options with different values.

Option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2π h, but that doesn't make sense because our calculation shows the eigenvalues are real. Because the matrix S is Hermitian? Let me check. The matrix S is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Taking the conjugate transpose, it's [0, i; -i, 0], which is not the same as S. Oh wait, wait, S is skew-Hermitian perhaps. Because S† = -S. Let me compute S†:

S† = [0, i; -i, 0], which is -S, since S is [0,-i; i,0], so S† = -S. So S is a skew-Hermitian matrix. So when you multiply by a scalar c, and c is real, Ay = c S is also skew-Hermitian.

Wait, but for a skew-Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. Oh! Because for a general matrix, if a is an eigenvalue, then for a skew-Hermitian matrix, a must be imaginary. Because if M is skew-Hermitian, M† = -M, so for any eigenvalue λ of M, λ* is the eigenvalue of M†, which is -M. So if M |ψ> = λ |ψ>, then M† |ψ> = λ* |ψ> = -M |ψ> = -λ |ψ>. So λ* = -λ, which implies λ is purely imaginary.

Oh! So that changes things. So the eigenvalues of Ay must be purely imaginary. So my previous calculation must have made a mistake because I thought they were real.

Wait, so I thought that the determinant was a² - (h²/(4π)^2) = 0, leading to a= ± h/(4π). But if the matrix is skew-Hermitian, the eigenvalues must be imaginary. So perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant of (Ay - a I) because I might have messed up the signs.

Ay is c S, c = h/(4π). So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0, -i c ]
[ i c, 0 ]

So when I write (Ay - a I), it's:

[ -a, -i c ]
[ i c, -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c² = ( (-i^2) ) * c².

Wait, (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So it's 1 * c², which is c².

So determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ± c.

But wait, Ay is a skew-Hermitian operator, so eigenvalues should be ±i c. Because the determinant equation gives a² = c², but since the eigenvalues are imaginary, a must be ±i c.

Oh! So I must have messed up the initial calculation. Because I thought the eigenvalues were real, but they should be imaginary. So the correct eigenvalues are a = ± i c, which is ±i (h/(4π)).

Wait, but that's different from what I got earlier. Let me see: if I have a matrix that's skew-Hermitian, its eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the determinant equation gives a² = c² → a = ± c, but since a must be imaginary, it's a = ±i c.

So the eigenvalues are a = ±i (h/(4π)).

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2π h, which can't be right because our calculation shows imaginary part is ± h/(4π) multiplied by i, so the magnitude is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with magnitude h/(4π).

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't fit either.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait. Let me think about this. Because Ay and A² commute? Well, I think A² is (c S)^2. Since S is the spin-1/2 matrix, S^2 would be (h^2/(4π^2)) (1/2)(1/2 +1) I, perhaps. Wait, for spin-1/2, S² = (ℏ/2)^2 I, but I'm not sure about the units here. Alternatively, perhaps A is proportional to S, so A^2 would be proportional to S².

Wait, because A = c S, so A² = c^2 S². And S² = ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ^2 I, but wait, in our case, perhaps the units are such that S² is (3/4) I (since 1/2 (1/2 +1) = 3/4).

But regardless, if A² is a multiple of the identity matrix, then any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A², because A² is a scalar multiple. So option C says that the eigenvectors of Ay can also be eigenvectors of A², which is correct because A² is a multiple of identity, so any vector is an eigenvector.

But option C also says it's not of Az. So Az is the Z-component, which is different. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenvectors wouldn't be the same. So the statement in option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that. The basis functions of the operator would be its eigenvectors. Since the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, that would be correct. But I'm not sure. Wait, the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix (when diagonalizable) form a basis for the vector space. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That seems correct. Or perhaps D is just saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis of the matrix; not sure.

Wait, but let's get back to the options. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Imaginary part ±2π h, real part ±h/(4π). But we found the eigenvalues are ±i (h/(4π)), so the real parts are zero, and the imaginary parts are ±h/(4π). So A is incorrect because it says the imaginary part is ±2π h, which is way bigger.

Option B: The eigenvalues' imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't match, since our a is ±i (h/(4π)).

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Well, as I thought earlier, since A² is a scalar multiple of identity, any vector is an eigenvector. So the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A². But they won't be eigenvectors of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. That's a bit ambiguous. The basis functions are the eigenvectors, which are the eigenfunctions here. So D is correct as well. Wait, but matrix Ay is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That would be correct.

Wait, but looking back, the question says 'which statement below will you consider to be correct' during the calculation.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az. So, since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenvectors are different. So the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Well, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct?

Wait, no, let me reevaluate. The question is about calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Let me think: when you diagonalize a 2x2 matrix, you find its eigenvectors. The eigenvectors form a basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That's correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is a multiple of identity, any vector is an eigenvector. So the same eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² as well. So C is correct.

So which of the options (C or D) is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement will be considered correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, the choices are mutually exclusive.

Wait, looking again at option C: It says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is true because A² is a multiple of I, so every vector is an eigenvector. But the second part says not of Az. Which is correct because Az is a different component, and Ay and Az don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps more than one can be correct, but only options are a single letter.

Wait, but looking back, the options are given as A, B, C, D. So I must choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps D is correct because the matrix is 2x2 and the eigenvectors are the basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps option C is a better choice because it's talking about the relationship between eigenfunctions and other operators. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation, which might involve the properties of eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the eigenvalues. Let's do that.

Earlier, I thought that the eigenvalues are ±i (h/(4π)), because the matrix is skew-Hermitian.

So the eigenvalues are a = ±i c, where c = h/(4π). So a = ±i (h/(4π)).

Which option corresponds to this? Let's see.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh. Wait, no, because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so their real parts are zero. So A is incorrect.

Option B: It's talking about real parts, which are ±1, and imaginary parts ±1/2. Doesn't fit; our a has real part zero, and imaginary part ±h/(4π).

So that leaves options C and D.

So the question is, which statements about the calculation are correct.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² is a multiple of identity, so any vector is an eigenfunction. So C's first part is correct. The second part is also correct because Az is a different component operator, and they don't commute, so eigenvectors of Ay won't be eigenvectors of Az.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question is during the calculation of eigenvalue and eigenvectors of Ay, which statement is correct.

Hmm, during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That sounds correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

If the matrix is diagonalizable, which it should be, since it's 2x2 and has two eigenvalues, then the eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis for the matrix operator. So D is correct.

But why is option C correct? Because the same eigenvectors are eigenvectors of A², but not of Az.

But perhaps the correct answer is C because when calculating the eigenvectors, you find that they are compatible with A² but not with Az.

So, considering the options, the correct statements are either C or D. Which one is correct?

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but I think the correct choice is C. Because during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you find that the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A², which is correct. But they are not eigenvectors of Az.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me think again about the eigenvalues.

Wait, the matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * S, where S is the matrix given. So S is:

[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

What's the trace of S? Zero. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (i^2*(-1)) = 0 - ( (-1) ) = 1. So determinant is 1.

Wait, no, (0)(0) is zero. The other term is (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is 0 - 1 = -1. Wait, no, the determinant is the (0,0) term times (1,1) term minus (0,1) times (1,0). So (0 * 0) - (-i * i) equals 0 - ( (-i)(i) )= 0 - ( -i² )= 0 - ( -(-1) )= 0 - (1) = -1. So det(S) is -1.

So the trace is zero, determinant is -1. The eigenvalues λ of S satisfy λ^2 - (trace) λ + det = 0 → λ^2 + 0λ -1 = 0 → λ^2=1 → λ= ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. So Ay = c S → eigenvalues are c * 1 and c * (-1). So a = c and -c.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the eigenvalues are ±i c because the matrix is skew-Hermitian. But according to this calculation, the eigenvalues are real, ±c. That's conflicting.

Wait, what's the problem here. Let me double-check.

If S is skew-Hermitian, then the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. But according to the matrix S given, let's compute S†:

S† is the conjugate transpose. So S is:

[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

So S† is:

[ 0, i ]
[ -i, 0 ]

Which is equal to -S, since:

- S is:

[ 0, i ]
[ -i, 0 ]

Which is exactly S†. So S is skew-Hermitian, which means that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

But when I calculated the eigenvalues of S, using the characteristic equation, I found them to be ±1, which are real. This is a contradiction.

Hmm, where is the mistake? Let me compute the eigenvalues of S correctly.

The matrix S is:

0   -i
i    0

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ   -i   |
| i    -λ |

Determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ^2 - ( (-i)(i) )

But (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So according to this, the eigenvalues are real, ±1. But earlier, I thought that a skew-Hermitian matrix must have eigenvalues purely imaginary. So what's the issue here?

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is not skew-Hermitian? Because when I compute S†, I get:

[0, i;
 -i, 0 ]

Which is -S, since S is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

So S† = -S → which implies S is skew-Hermitian. So in that case, the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. But according to the calculation, they are real. That's a contradiction. So what's happening here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute S^dagger again.

S is:

Row 1: [0, -i]

Row 2: [i, 0]

So S^dagger (conjugate transpose) is:

Column 1: [0, i]

Column 2: [i, 0]

Wait no, columns become rows after transposing and conjugating. So the first column is [0, i]^T, and the second is [i, 0]^T.

So S^dagger = [0   i;
             -i  0 ]

Which is equal to -S, because S is:

0   -i

i    0

So -S is:

0    i

-i    0

Which is exactly S^dagger. So S is indeed skew-Hermitian.

But the eigenvalues are real, ±1, which contradicts the property that eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix are purely imaginary.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe S isn't skew-Hermitian? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps S is Hermitian. Let me check. Hermitian means S† = S.

No, earlier computation shows S† = -S, so it's skew-Hermitian.

Wait, another approach: For a 2x2 matrix like this, which is a Pauli matrix multiplied by i.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

Looking at S, it's:

0  -i
i   0

Which is equal to i times σ_y, because σ_y is:

0  -i
i   0

Wait, no. σ_y is:

[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

So S is equal to σ_y. But σ_y is a Hermitian matrix, because σ_y† = σ_y.

Wait, no. Let me compute σ_y†.

σ_y is:

[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

Transposing and conjugating:

[0, i;
-i, 0 ]

Which is equal to -σ_y, because σ_y is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

So σ_y is skew-Hermitian? Or is it Hermitian?

Wait, no. Wait, σ_y is Hermitian because σ_y† = σ_y.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me compute σ_y†.

σ_y is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

Taking the conjugate transpose, the (1,2) element becomes i, and the (2,1) becomes -i. So σ_y† is:

[0, i;
 -i, 0 ]

Which is not equal to σ_y, because:

σ_y is:

0, -i

i, 0

σ_y† is:

0, i

-i, 0

Which is -σ_y. So σ_y is skew-Hermitian.

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So there's a contradiction here. Hmm.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. σ_y is:

[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

Wait, let me compute σ_y†:

The (1,1) element is 0.

(1,2) element is -i, so its conjugate is i.

(2,1) element is i, so its conjugate is -i.

(2,2) element is 0.

So σ_y† is:

[ 0, i;
 -i, 0 ]

Which is equal to -σ_y.

So σ_y is skew-Hermitian, which is a problem because I thought Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting the definitions wrong.

Wait, no. The Pauli matrices are defined as Hermitian. So σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are all Hermitian. So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, let me double-check. σ_x is:

[1, 0;
0, 1]?

No, wait, no. σ_x is:

[0, 1;
1, 0 ]

σ_y is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

σ_z is:

[1,0;
0,-1]

So σ_x is Hermitian because σ_x† = σ_x.

σ_y† = [0, i; -i, 0 ] = -σ_y. So σ_y is skew-Hermitian. But that's conflicting with the fact that the Pauli matrices are supposed to be Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, no, σ_y is Hermitian. Because σ_y† = σ_y.

Wait, no. Because σ_y is:

0  -i

i   0

So σ_y† is:

0  i

-i 0

Which is the same as -σ_y. Because σ_y is:

0, -i

i, 0.

So σ_y† is -σ_y. So that would imply that σ_y is skew-Hermitian, not Hermitian.

But this contradicts what I know about Pauli matrices being Hermitian. So perhaps there's an error in the way I'm defining σ_y.

Wait, I think I must be getting the signs wrong. Let me check online. Oh wait, I can't do that. But I recall that σ_y is Hermitian, so perhaps I have a sign error in the definition of S.

Wait, the given matrix S is:

0   -i

i    0

Which is the same as σ_y. So if S is σ_y, then S should be Hermitian. But according to the calculation, S† = -S, which would make it skew-Hermitian.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is in the initial setup. Maybe the matrix S is actually σ_y, which is Hermitian. So then the eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows the eigenvalues of S are ±1, which are real. So that makes sense. So perhaps the matrix S is Hermitian, which would mean that in the problem statement, S is Hermitian, not skew-Hermitian.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows S† = -S, which would imply it's skew-Hermitian. So maybe I made a mistake in the definition.

Wait, perhaps the S matrix given is actually Hermitian, and the earlier conclusion that S† = -S is wrong. Let me recompute S†.

S is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

S† is the conjugate transpose. So the (1,2) element is -i, so its conjugate is i. The (2,1) element is i, whose conjugate is -i.

So S† is:

[0, i;
 -i, 0 ]

Which is equal to -S, because S is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

So S† = -S. Which makes S skew-Hermitian. So that suggests that S is skew-Hermitian, which would imply that eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

But according to the characteristic equation, the eigenvalues are ±1, which are real. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I made a mistake in calculating the determinant. Let me recompute the determinant of (S - λ I).

S is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

So (S − λ I) is:

[−λ, −i;
i, −λ ]

The determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (−i)(i) = λ² − ( (−i)(i) )

Compute (−i)(i) = −i² = −(−1) = 1. So determinant = λ² − 1.

Set to zero: λ² −1 =0 → λ = ±1.

So eigenvalues are ±1, which are real.

But S is skew-Hermitian, which requires eigenvalues to be purely imaginary.

This is a contradiction. So what is the problem here?

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is defined incorrectly. Or perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that S is skew-Hermitian.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is not skew-Hermitian but Hermitian. Because if S is Hermitian, then eigenvalues are real, which aligns with the calculation.

But earlier calculation shows S† = -S, which is skew-Hermitian. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the given matrix S is actually the same as σ_y, which is Hermitian. Let me re-express S:

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Which is the same as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is -S. So S is skew-Hermitian.

But that makes the eigenvalues purely imaginary, but according to the calculation, they are real. That can't be. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I got the definition of S wrong. Let me think again. If S is Hermitian, then S^dagger = S.

But according to the given matrix, S^dagger = -S, which implies it's skew-Hermitian.

So the only conclusion is that S is skew-Hermitian, and the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. But according to the calculation, the eigenvalues are real. So there must be a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the determinant calculation. Let me recalculate the determinant.

Matrix (S − λ I) is:

[ -λ, -i ]

[ i, -λ ]

The determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (−i)(i) = λ² − (−i)(i).

Compute (−i)(i) = −i² = −(−1) = 1. So determinant is λ² − 1 = 0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

But for a skew-Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. So the only way this makes sense is if the matrix is actually Hermitian. But according to S† = -S, it's skew-Hermitian.

This is really confusing. Maybe I should accept that the eigenvalues are ±1, and proceed with the calculation.

So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay = c S are ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues of Ay are a = ± h/(4π).

But wait, this contradicts the earlier conclusion that for a skew-Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues must be imaginary. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the given matrix S is not skew-Hermitian but Hermitian.

Wait, let me check if S is Hermitian. For S to be Hermitian, S† must equal S.

S is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

S† is:

[0, i;
 -i, 0 ]

Which is not equal to S. So S is not Hermitian.

Hmm. So the only conclusion is that the matrix is skew-Hermitian, leading to eigenvalues purely imaginary, but our calculation shows them real. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me compute eigenvalues of S using another method.

Let me compute the trace and determinant. Trace is 0 + 0 = 0. Determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - ( (-i)(i) )= 0 - (1) = -1.

The eigenvalues are roots of λ² - (trace) λ + determinant = 0 → λ² +0λ -1 = 0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

So, real eigenvalues. But for a skew-Hermitian matrix, this is impossible. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps S is actually Hermitian. So maybe I made a mistake in computing S†. Let me recompute S†.

Original S:

Row 1: [0, -i]

Row 2: [i, 0]

So S is a 2x2. The conjugate transpose (S†) is formed by taking the transpose and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.

Transposing S:

First row becomes first column: [0, i]

Second row becomes second column: [-i, 0]

Then taking complex conjugate: [0, -i] becomes [0, i] → Wait, no. Wait, the elements of S are:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So their conjugates are [0, i], [-i, 0].

So after transposing, the matrix becomes:

[0, i]
[-i, 0]

Which is equal to -S:

Because S is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So -S is:

[0, i]
[-i, 0]

Which is equal to S†.

So S is indeed skew-Hermitian, which has eigenvalues purely imaginary. But according to the calculation, the eigenvalues are real. So I'm stuck.

Perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation that the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π) because the determinant suggests that.

But according to the properties, the eigenvalues must be purely imaginary. So perhaps the problem has a mistake in the setup.

But regardless, I have to choose the correct option based on the calculation.

So, the eigenvalues are a = ± (h/(4π)).

But looking at the options, none of them match this directly.

Wait, option A says the imaginary part is ±2π h. That's incorrect because our a is real.

Wait, no. Earlier conclusion was that the eigenvalues are real, but according to the properties, they should be imaginary. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the given matrix S is not skew-Hermitian, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S is Hermitian, so the eigenvalues are real, and the initial assumption about it being skew-Hermitian is wrong.

So proceeding with real eigenvalues, a = ± h/(4π).

But looking at the options, none have real parts as h/(4π).

Wait, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is way larger. Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No.

Hmm, perhaps the correct eigenvalues are ±i (h/(4π)).

Because earlier calculation suggested that, but the eigenvalue equation gives real numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the matrix Ay is given as c·S, and since S is skew-Hermitian, Ay is a purely imaginary operator. So the operator's eigenvalues are purely imaginary, but my calculation says real. So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues again.

Ay is c S, so the matrix is:

[0, -i c]

[i c, 0 ]

So to find eigenvalues, solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

(Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, -i c ]

[ i c, -a ]

The determinant is (−a)(−a) - (−i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Compute (−i c)(i c) = (−i)(i) c² = (−i^2) c² = −(−1) c² = c².

So determinant equation: a² - c² = 0 → a = ± c.

But because Ay is skew-Hermitian, a must be purely imaginary. So a = ± i c.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if I set a = i c, then a² = (i c)^2 = -c² → a² - c² = -c² - c² = -2 c², which is not zero. Wait, but a² = (i c)^2 = -c². So the equation is a² - c² = 0 → -c² - c² = -2 c² = 0 → not possible.

Wait, this is getting more confusing. I think I'm getting stuck in a loop here.

Let me try to write the equation again.

The determinant is a² - c^2 = 0 → a^2 = c^2 → a = ± c.

But since Ay is skew-Hermitian, a must be ±i c.

So perhaps the correct eigenvalues are a = ± i c.

But then a² = (i c)^2 = -c² → a² - c² = -c² - c² = -2 c² ≠ 0. So it's not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the correct eigenvalues are ± c, but that would imply that they are real, which contradicts the skew-Hermitian property.

This is really confusing. Maybe I should proceed by considering that the eigenvalues are ± i c, which are imaginary.

But according to the determinant equation, a^2 = c^2 → a = ± c. So how to reconcile these?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant. Let me compute the determinant again.

(Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, -i c ]

[ i c, -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² = (−i²) c² = −(−1) c² = c².

So the determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a = ± c.

But since the matrix is skew-Hermitian, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So the only way this makes sense is if c is purely imaginary, but c is given as h/(4π), which is real.

So this suggests that there's a mistake in the setup of the problem. Because the matrix is skew-Hermitian, the eigenvalues should be imaginary, but the calculation suggests real eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S is not skew-Hermitian. Let me check again.

Wait, S is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

Which is the same as the Pauli matrix σ_y, which I thought was Hermitian.

Wait, σ_y is Hermitian, so S must be Hermitian. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I thought S is skew-Hermitian.

Wait, let me compute S^† again.

S is:

Row 1: 0, -i.

Row 2: i, 0.

So S^† is the conjugate transpose. So, the first row becomes the first column, and the elements are conjugated.

So S^† is:

[0, i;
-i, 0 ]

Which is equal to σ_y, which is the same as S. So S^† = S → S is Hermitian.

Wait, this is different from what I thought earlier. So maybe I messed up earlier calculations.

So if S is Hermitian, then the eigenvalues are real, which aligns with the calculation. So the prior confusion comes from a mistake in assuming S is skew-Hermitian.

So, S is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real, ±1.

Thus, Ay = c S has eigenvalues a = ± c = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π).

But looking back at the options, none of the options seem to match this.

Wait, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h, real parts ± h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real, so imaginary part is zero.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also doesn't fit.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Let's think about that.

A² = (c S)^2 = c² S².

Since S is Hermitian and for spin-½ systems, S^2 = (ℏ/2)^2 I, but perhaps in this case, S² is another matrix.

Wait, let me compute S^2.

S is:

[0, -i;
i, 0 ]

S^2 = S * S.

Multiply the matrices:

First row, first column: 0*0 + (-i)*i = 0 + (-i^2) = 0 + (1) = 1.

First row, second column: 0*(-i) + (-i)*0 = 0 + 0 = 0.

Second row, first column: i*0 + 0*i = 0 + 0 = 0.

Second row, second column: i*(-i) + 0*0 = (-i^2) + 0 = (-(-1))=1.

So S^2 is:

[1, 0;
0, 1 ] = I.

So S^2 = I.

So A^2 = c² I.

So A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Thus, any vector is an eigenvector of A² with eigenvalue c².

Thus, the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A². So option C is correct in its first part.

The second part of option C says that the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Az is another component (the z-component of the angular momentum), and since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenvectors are different. So the statement in option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since Ay is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, this is correct. So option D is correct.

So now I'm confused again, because both C and D seem correct.

But the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, the correct options are C and D. But the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of Ay (which are eigenvectors of Ay) form a basis for the space, which is what option D says. So D is correct.

But option C also is correct, as the eigenvectors are compatible with A².

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But the options don't allow for that.

Alternatively, perhaps only option C is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, during the calculation, you would find that the eigenvectors of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So option C is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is C.


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \).
   - Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y - aI \) becomes:
     \[
     A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} 
     -a & -ic \\ 
     ic & -a 
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - The determinant is:
     \[
     \det(A_y - aI) = (-a)(-a) - (-ic)(ic) = a^2 - c^2.
     \]
   - Setting \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), we find:
     \[
     a^2 = c^2 \implies a = \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]
   - Since \( S \) is Hermitian, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real, \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

2. **Eigenvectors and Basis Functions:**
   - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2×2 space, as any diagonalizable matrix does. Thus, the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) are the basis functions of \( A_y \), making **Option D correct**.

3. **Relationship with \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - \( A^2 = (c \cdot S)^2 = c^2 \cdot S^2 \). Since \( S^2 = I \) (verified by direct computation), \( A^2 = c^2 I \), which is a multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, any vector is an eigenvector of \( A^2 \), and the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, meaning their eigenvectors are generally different. Thus, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), making **Option C correct**.

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real, \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not complex with imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \).
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).
   - **Option C:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (since \( A^2 \) is a multiple of the identity matrix), but not of \( A_z \) (as \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute).
   - **Option D:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the matrix operator \( A_y \).

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both **Option C** and **Option D** are correct. However, the question asks for the statement that is "considered correct during the calculation," which aligns more closely with **Option C**, as it directly relates to the properties of the eigenfunctions and their relationship with other operators.
