Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices. The question gives me a density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But how do I find its position in the qubit space?

I think the density matrix for a qubit can be represented as a vector in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch vector. So any single-qubit state can be described by a vector on the unit sphere in 3D. But wait, this is a density matrix, so it's a mixed state if it's not a pure state.

Let me recall: the Bloch vector (r) for a density matrix ρ is given by something like r = 2 (ρ · σ), where σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, no, more precisely, each component of r is related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

So for a general 2x2 density matrix ρ, it can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix and σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z). So the vector r is twice the expectation of the Pauli matrices in ρ minus the identity.

Wait, let me get that right. The general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So if I have that, I can find r_x, r_y, r_z from the components of ρ.

But wait, in our case, ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out that matrix. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them, we get [[1,0],[0,1]]. Divided by 2, so ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5.

Hmm, so if I compare this to the general form (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, then our ρ is (I)/2. Which implies that the coefficients of σ_x, σ_y, σ_z must all be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Wait, does that make sense? Because the state ρ is a completely mixed state. I remember that the maximum mixed state (like a completely random state) corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere. Because pure states are on the surface (radius 1), and as the state becomes more mixed, the radius decreases. So the completely mixed state is at the center, which is r=(0,0,0).

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector and \(\vec{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), it is evident that all coefficients of \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are zero. Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
