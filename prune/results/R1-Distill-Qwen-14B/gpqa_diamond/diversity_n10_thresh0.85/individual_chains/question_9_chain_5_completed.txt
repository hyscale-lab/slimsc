Okay, so I have this question about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules is classified using group theory, and C3h is one of those groups. Wait, what's C3h symmetry? Oh right, I think C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should have an axis that when rotated 120 degrees, it looks the same, and there's a mirror plane that's horizontal, like cutting through the molecule, that also leaves it looking the same.

Looking at the options given:

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran-...hexaone.
Option B: benzo[...]trifuran-...hexaone.
Option C: triisopropyl borate.
Option D: quinuclidine.

I need to figure out which of these has both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me think about each molecule one by one.

Starting with triisopropyl borate (Option C). I think triisopropyl borate is a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. The structure is something like B with three isopropyl substituents. Each isopropyl group is a CH(CH3)2. Wait, the molecule would be symmetric if the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the central atom (B). So if all three isopropyl groups are identical and placed at 120-degree angles around B, that would give a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. If the molecule is non-planar and the mirror plane is horizontal, perhaps through the boron and some arrangement of the substituents. Wait, triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar geometry, right? Because each isopropyl is like a bulky group around B. Wait no, wait, I think triisopropyl borane is actually a trigonal pyramidal structure? No, maybe not. Wait, maybe it's trigonal planar. Wait, but borane is usually trigonal planar. Triisopropyl borane would have three identical substituents around B in a trigonal planar arrangement. So the molecule would have a C3 axis. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Well, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane might just be the plane of the molecule itself. Wait, but for symmetry, a horizontal mirror plane is perpendicular to the main axis. Wait, the C3 axis is probably the central axis. So if the molecule is planar, a mirror plane that's horizontal would be in the plane of the molecule. But wait, in a trigonal planar structure, the mirror plane would be any plane that's through the central atom and bisects two substituents. So perhaps triisopropyl borate has multiple mirror planes, which might make it have higher symmetry. Hmm, but does it have a C3h symmetry? Wait, C3h implies a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. If the molecule is planar, maybe the horizontal mirror plane is part of the symmetry. But wait, if the molecule is planar and has a C3 axis, then it would belong to the D3h group, not C3h. Wait, no, D3h is a higher symmetry group that includes C3, σh, and other operations like inversion. So if a molecule has C3 and σh, it's in the C3h group, but if it has more symmetry like C3v (with vertical mirrors), then it's D3h.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. C3h symmetry would consist of a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule must have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that's horizontal. So for triisopropyl borane, if it's planar with three identical substituents, it might have a C3 axis and multiple mirror planes, including a horizontal one. But wait, if it's planar and has threefold symmetry, then perhaps it's in the D3h point group. Because D3h includes C3, σh, and other operations. So maybe triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, which would mean it doesn't fit C3h exactly. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. I'll need to think about the others.

Next, quinuclidine (Option D). Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, right? It's a norbornane derivative. The structure is a bridge bicyclic compound. I think it has a seven-membered ring with a bridge. Wait, actually, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure, right? So it's a bridge structure with two methyl groups on the bridgehead. Wait, no, quinuclidine itself is a bicyclo structure with a seven-membered ring, I think. But regarding symmetry: quinuclidine has a three-fold axis, perhaps. Let me visualize it. The molecule has a bridge that creates a three-membered ring in the bridge. Wait, no, the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure has two bridgeheads. The molecule is symmetric, but I'm not sure about the exact symmetry. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is such that it has a three-fold rotation axis. Because when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, and I think it's got a C3 symmetry. So a C3 axis. But what about the mirror planes? Does it have any? I'm not sure. If quinuclidine is a planar molecule, but it's not; it's a bridged bicyclic structure. So the mirror plane would have to pass through the bridge. Hmm, but in quinuclidine, the structure is such that there is a plane of symmetry that includes the bridge, making it a mirror plane. Wait, I think quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the bridge. So that would be a horizontal mirror plane. So if it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. Or wait, is the mirror plane vertical or horizontal? Because the mirror plane's orientation relative to the main axis matters.

Wait, the C3 axis in quinuclidine would be an axis going through the bridgehead. So if I imagine the molecule, the three-fold rotation would involve rotating around an axis that goes through the bridgehead and the opposite side, perhaps. So the mirror plane would have to be perpendicular to that axis. If the mirror plane is horizontal, that would mean it's cutting through the molecule in a direction perpendicular to the C3 axis. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the orientation, but if quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, it would fit C3h.

Moving on, let's look at the other options. The other options involve benzo and triphenylene fused with trifuran structures.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

These seem to be more complex structures with multiple fused rings. Let me think about their symmetry.

Benzo-based structures often have certain symmetries, but I'm not sure. Triphenylene is a triphenylene group, which is a tricyclic aromatic system with three benzene rings connected in a way that gives a certain symmetry.

Wait, for benzo-fused structures, sometimes the symmetry is lower because of the way the rings are fused. For example, in option B, the benzo group is fused with trifuran, which is a three-membered ring with oxygen (or another heteroatom) attached. The numbering suggests how the rings are connected. But I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Alternatively, if the molecule has three-fold symmetry, perhaps in the arrangement of substituents.

Wait, trifuran is a five-membered ring with three double bonds, I think. So in the molecule, the central part is a trifuran ring, but with other rings fused to it.

Wait, perhaps the molecule in option B has a three-fold symmetry because the substituents are arranged symmetrically around the central ring.

Alternatively, let me think about the number of symmetry elements. For a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, another approach: C3h has a horizontal mirror plane and a C3 axis perpendicular to it. So the symmetry elements include a three-fold rotation and reflection across a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

So I should look for a molecule that has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis.

Looking at triphenyleno[...]trifuran in option A: triphenylene is a tricyclic structure with three benzene rings, each connected in a symmetric fashion. The triphenylene group is symmetrical, perhaps with a three-fold axis. Then, it's fused with a trifuran ring, which is a five-membered ring with three oxygen atoms or other substituents. If the fusion is symmetric, perhaps the overall molecule would have a three-fold axis. Also, if the molecule is symmetric across a plane that's perpendicular to that axis, it would have the C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the benzo-based structure in option B might not have the same symmetry because the way the benzo group is fused could break the three-fold symmetry.

So comparing options A and B, triphenylene-based (A) might have the required symmetry because the triphenylene itself is symmetric and the fusion might maintain that symmetry, leading to a C3h symmetry in the molecule.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about each structure.

Triphenylene is a symmetric molecule, with three benzene rings arranged around a central point. So if you have a triphenylene group fused to a central ring, like trifuran, and the fusion is such that each of the three rings is connected symmetrically, then the overall structure would have a three-fold rotation axis. Additionally, if there's a plane that cuts through the molecule perpendicularly to that axis, serving as a mirror, then it would have C3h symmetry.

In option A, the molecule is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. The fusion points are 1,2-c; 5,6-c'; and 9,10-c''. I think this would imply that each benzene ring of triphenylene is fused to each of the three positions on the trifuran. If the trifuran is a central three-membered ring, and each of the three substituents is a benzene ring, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. Additionally, if the molecule is symmetric across a horizontal plane, it would satisfy C3h.

On the other hand, option B is a benzo-fused structure, which might not have the same symmetry. Benzo is a single benzene ring, and when fused with the trifuran, it's probably not as symmetric as the triphenylene-based structure.

So perhaps option A has the C3h symmetry.

Wait, but what about quinuclidine? Earlier, I thought it might have C3h symmetry. How does that compare?

Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, which is a bridge structure. It has a three-fold axis because if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me visualize it. The molecule is somewhat like a crown ether but smaller. The bridge is in the middle, and the three substituents (like the methyl groups in norbornane) are arranged around it. So if you imagine the molecule sitting on a surface, looking down from the top, you can see a three-fold symmetry. But a mirror plane would cut through the molecule. If there's a mirror plane that's horizontal, passing through the center of the molecule, then quinuclidine would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, another thought: quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry that bisects the bridge. That would be a vertical plane, not a horizontal one. So maybe quinuclidine doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, but perhaps a vertical one. So that would make its symmetry group C3v, which is different from C3h. Because C3v has a vertical mirror plane, while C3h has a horizontal one.

So perhaps quinuclidine has C3v symmetry, not C3h. So it wouldn't be the correct answer.

So back to the options. So far, triphenyleno-based option A seems like a candidate.

Wait, what about triisopropyl borate (option C)? Earlier I thought it might be D3h, which includes C3h as a subset. But if it's D3h, then it's higher symmetry than C3h. So the question is, which of the options has exactly C3h symmetry, not higher.

Hmm, perhaps triisopropyl borate's structure doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Triisopropyl borane would have three isopropyl groups around B. The molecule is trigonal planar, so the structure is flat. In a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents, you have multiple symmetry elements. So you have a C3 axis, and three mirror planes each bisecting two substituents. But wait, if the mirror planes are all vertical (like in a trigonal planar molecule), then the symmetry group would be D3h. Because D3h includes C3, σh (a horizontal mirror plane), and other elements. So if triisopropyl borate has a horizontal mirror plane and a C3 axis, then its symmetry is D3h, which is a superset of C3h.

So in that case, the molecule would have C3h symmetry as part of D3h, but the question is which has exactly C3h symmetry. Wait, but the options are given as molecules, and some of them might belong to C3h, others to D3h, or other groups. So the question is, which of them has C3h, not higher.

So if triisopropyl borate is in D3h, then it wouldn't be the answer. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about the exact symmetry of triphenyleno-based compound. Let me think about the structure.

Triphenylene is a symmetric tricyclic compound. The triphenylene group is three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, each attached to a central point. If the trifuran is attached in a way that each of the three rings is connected equally, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

If the entire molecule is planar and the mirror plane is across the molecule, that would be a horizontal plane in the overall structure. But wait, trifuran is a five-membered ring, so the molecule would be non-planar, but arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule in option A has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis, making it C3h.

Another angle: the question is about which of the options has C3h symmetry. So let's evaluate each:

A) Triphenyleno...: Possibly has C3h.

B) Benzo...: Probably lower symmetry.

C) Triisopropyl borate: Higher symmetry (D3h), so not the answer.

D) Quinuclidine: Possibly C3v, not C3h.

So the correct answer should be option A or option B.

Wait, I'm getting a little stuck. Let me think: Benzo... has a single benzene ring attached. So the symmetry would be lower compared to triphenylene, which has three rings. So option A is more likely to have the required symmetry.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option A.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on the defining characteristics of **C₃h** symmetry. This symmetry group includes a three-fold rotation axis (**C₃**) and a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**). The molecule must appear identical after a 120° rotation about the **C₃** axis and also be symmetric with respect to a horizontal mirror plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of a triphenylene group (three benzene rings arranged symmetrically) fused with a trifuran ring. 
- The triphenylene group itself is highly symmetric, with a three-fold rotation axis (**C₃**) at the center. 
- The fusion with the trifuran ring is symmetric, maintaining the **C₃** axis. Additionally, the molecule likely has a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**) that bisects the structure perpendicularly to the **C₃** axis.
- This molecule satisfies the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran structure. The benzo group introduces asymmetry compared to the triphenylene-based structure in Option A.
- While the trifuran core may have a **C₃** axis, the fusion with the single benzo ring disrupts the overall symmetry, making it unlikely to have a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**).
- This molecule does not satisfy the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**
- Triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around a central boron atom. This gives it a **C₃** axis.
- However, the molecule also has multiple vertical mirror planes, making its symmetry group **D₃h**, which is a higher symmetry group than **C₃h**.
- Since the question asks for a molecule with exactly **C₃h** symmetry, this option is not correct.

#### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. It has a three-fold rotation axis (**C₃**) due to its symmetric arrangement of substituents.
- However, the molecule's plane of symmetry is vertical, not horizontal, making its symmetry group **C₃v**, not **C₃h**.
- This molecule does not satisfy the criteria for **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
The molecule in **Option A** (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) has both a **C₃** axis and a horizontal mirror plane (**σh**), making it the correct choice for **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: A**
