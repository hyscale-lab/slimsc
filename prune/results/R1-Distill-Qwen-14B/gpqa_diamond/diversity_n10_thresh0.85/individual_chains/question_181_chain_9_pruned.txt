Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, especially in its core. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, right? But the question here is about the pp-III branch stopping. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? I think it's a part of the proton-proton cycle that involves more steps, maybe involving heavier elements or different reactions.

So, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos too. Oh wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are from the pp-I and maybe the CNO cycle, but the pp-III is another source. But if it stops, how does that affect the neutrino flux?

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux(band1)/flux(band2) is what we need to find.

I think neutrinos have specific energy distributions. The pp-III reactions probably produce neutrinos at certain energies. If the pp-III branch stops, those neutrinos won't be produced anymore, but the others (like from pp-I or CNO) continue.

Wait, the neutrinos I'm thinking about are from the pep reaction (pp-I), the main pp chain, and
