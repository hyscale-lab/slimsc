Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm. Let's see. The question is about the ratio of flux in two neutrino energy bands when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. 

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the Sun's energy production involves a few steps. The proton-proton chain, right? There are different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which involve different paths. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces carbon-12 via the triple-alpha process or something? No, wait. No, the triple-alpha is part of the CNO cycle maybe. Wait, no, I think the pp chain has branches. The pp-III branch might involve higher energy reactions.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The main pp chain (pp-I) is where two protons collide, forming deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, and then two helium-3s combine into helium-4. The pp-II branch is where a helium-3 combines with a helium-4 to make carbon-12, and maybe emits a photon. The pp-III branch is another process, perhaps involving higher energy states or different pathways. Oh, right, the pp-III branch might involve the production of boron-8, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's part of the CNO cycle? Wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different process altogether, involving carbon, nitrogen, oxygen.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly through the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces electron neutrinos (ν_e) through the decay of boron-8, which has a longer half-life. The CNO cycle also produces ν_e via similar processes but perhaps in different energy ranges.

So, the question says the pp-III branch stops. So what does that mean for neutrino production? If the pp-III process stops, then the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop. But since it's only the pp-III branch, other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) continue. Or wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced mainly in the pp chain, especially the main branch (pp-I) which produces a lot of neutrinos via boron-8 decay. The pp-III branch, if it's a minor contributor, stopping it might only reduce the neutrino flux a bit. But I need to think about the neutrino energies.

Neutrino energies from the Sun are in specific energy ranges. The main neutrino line is around 1.4 MeV, from the decay of boron-8, which comes from the pp-I branch. Then there are other lines from the pp-II and pp-III branches, perhaps at lower or higher energies.

Wait, the question is about two specific bands: 700-800 keV (band1) and 800-900 keV (band2). So these are lower energy neutrinos.

If the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos does that affect? Since the pp-III is a branch, maybe it contributes to neutrinos in a certain energy range.

Wait, I think the neutrino energy spectrum from the Sun peaks around a few hundred keV to a few MeV. The lower energy neutrinos (like 200-500 keV) are from the pp-I branch, while higher energy ones are from the CNO cycle perhaps? Or maybe the opposite? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, the pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to the CNO cycle. Because the CNO cycle occurs in hotter, denser regions, maybe producing higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, the pp-I branch produces neutrinos via the decay of boron-8, which has a half-life of about 20 minutes. The energy of these neutrinos is about 1.4 MeV. So that's in the higher energy range. 

But the question is about lower energy bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV, which is less than a MeV. So these might be from different processes. Maybe from the pp-II or pp-III branches, or perhaps from other reactions.

Wait, I remember that in the Sun, in addition to the main pp branch, there are other processes. For example, the pp-II branch can produce some neutrinos when a helium-3 captures a proton to form carbon-12 and emits a photon. But I'm not sure if that produces neutrinos. Or wait, neutrinos are produced when a nucleus emits a beta particle, right? So maybe the pp-III branch produces some neutrinos via beta decays.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch leads to the production of heavier elements, which then decay and produce neutrinos. But I'm not entirely certain.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, perhaps the main source of the lower-energy neutrinos is affected. So if the pp-III is a minor contributor to the neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV range, stopping it would reduce that flux.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio between the two bands. So if the pp-III was a major source for band1 (700-800 keV) and not for band2 (800-900 keV), then stopping it would make the flux in band1 decrease more than band2, so the ratio (flux1/flux2) would decrease.

Alternatively, maybe both bands are affected, but the dependence is different.

Wait, perhaps the neutrino flux in the lower energy bands (like 700-800 keV) comes mostly from the pp-
