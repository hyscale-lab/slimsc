Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by breaking down the given data and the reaction conditions.

First, looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually suggests an -OH stretch or maybe an -NH group. But since there's no mention of NMR signals around 8-9 ppm that would indicate NH protons, I'm thinking it's more likely an -OH group. Then the peaks at 1720 cm-1 and 1610 cm-1. The 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be broader and maybe around 2500-3300 as a very broad peak. Hmm, but in the IR, the 3400-2500 is a single region. Could it be a ketone or maybe an ester? Alternatively, maybe an acid with a strong O-H. 

The 1610 cm-1 might be an aromatic C=C stretch, so the compound probably has an aromatic ring. The 1450 could be another aromatic ring mode or perhaps a CH2 bending in a substituent.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The signals are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which usually corresponds to an -OH proton. So that's supporting the IR thought of a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but sometimes in NMR, if the exchange is slow, it can show up as a singlet. But more commonly, a broad peak around 10-12 ppm is a carboxylic proton.

Wait, but another possibility is an aldehyde proton, which is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But here it's at 10.5, which is a bit higher than aldehyde. Also, aldehydes don't have O-H, so that's probably not it.

Next: 8.
