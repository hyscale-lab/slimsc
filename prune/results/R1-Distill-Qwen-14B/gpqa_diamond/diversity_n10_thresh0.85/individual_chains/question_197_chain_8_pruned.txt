Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in a reaction called the Hunsdiecker reaction. Wait, no, wait. Or was it the oxymercuration? Hmm... Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the preparation of alkenes from alkyl halides in what's called the McIntosh reaction? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI is used for dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. Or wait, another possibility: maybe it's the reaction where a halogen is replaced by something else. Oh, wait, I think when you have a benzyl halide and you use HI with red phosphorus, it's a substitution reaction. Oh, right! I think that's the case here. So the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, probably an elimination if it's a vicinal dihalide, but maybe in this case, it's a substitution.

Wait, but wait. Wait, red phosphorus in presence of HI is used for the substitution of a leaving group. For example, in a benzyl halide, like benzyl chloride, reacting with HI would substitute the chloride with iodide. But in this case, the compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, so perhaps X is a benzyl bromide or chloride, and this reaction would replace it with iodide.

But then, what's the structure of X? Because the question is about the product, and I need to figure out what X is first.

The data given are IR and NMR. Let's look at the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That's a broad peak, probably an O-H stretch, possibly from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an amide or an ether. But the 1720 cm-1 peak is strong. I recall that 1720 is around the area for carbonyl groups. Maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid (though that's usually higher, like 1700 and a broad peak), or maybe an acid derivative. Then there's 1610 and 1450, which are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So probably, the compound has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because the peak is broad and at around 10 ppm, that makes sense. So maybe X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, wait, but the product comes after reacting X with red phosphorus and HI. Oh, but if X has a carboxylic acid group, maybe that's part of the structure.

Looking at the NMR again:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Probably the -COOH proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, perhaps para substituted.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, maybe ortho or meta. If the substituents are para, this could be the other two protons. For example, in para-substitution, two protons as doublets.

Then, the rest of the NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a methine (CH) group adjacent to something else, perhaps an oxygen or a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 group next to a CH or something.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group attached to something, perhaps to a CH group (like a geminal methyl). Wait, a triplet or a doublet? No, it's a doublet here. So maybe a -CH(CH3)- group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain. So like CH2CH3. But wait, the splitting here is a triplet, but in the data, it's a triplet. Oh wait, no, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet because it's attached to a CH2. So that would fit an ethyl group, like -CH2CH3.

Putting this together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituents are in the para position. The substituent may be a group attached to the ring, perhaps a side chain.

Looking at the other NMR peaks, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which might be a CH connected to another group. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which could be a methyl attached to a CH (like in isobutyl groups). The 0.9 ppm triplet for 3H is a terminal CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a side chain. Let's imagine the substituent is something like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a side chain that's -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So that suggests a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet, typical of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

Wait, but wait. If it's a benzoic acid, the COOH would be at around 10-12 ppm, and the carbonyl would be around 1700. But the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a bit higher. Could it be an ester? Because esters have carbonyls around 1740-1720. So maybe the compound is an ester of a benzoic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which
