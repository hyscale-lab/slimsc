Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star that has some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star has the same radius as the Sun, effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. They mention that these spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, which I think is the filling factor. The setup is that when the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transit. 

The question is asking, if we didn't have those spots, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do. So we're comparing the signal from the planet transit to the signal from the spotted hemisphere.

Hmm, I remember that the transit method for exoplanet detection works by measuring the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So the formula for the transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (T_star^4 / T_planet^4), but wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Wait no, the transit depth is the area blocked times the ratio of the fluxes. Wait, no, actually, the star emits flux, and when a planet transits, it blocks some of that flux.

Wait, the flux from the star is L = 4πR^2 σ T^4. So the total luminosity is a function of radius and temperature. But when a part of the star is blocked, the observed flux decreases by the area blocked times the flux per unit area.

Ah, right. The star's total flux is L = 4πR_star² σ Teff^4. The flux from a spot would be less because the spot is cooler. So when the star rotates, the spot comes into view, making the observed flux drop. But wait, the problem says that the spots are in one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots are either visible or not, causing brightness variations.

But the question is about comparing this to a hypothetical planet transit. So the dip in brightness would be similar in amplitude if the planet blocks the same amount of flux as the spots do.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the star is observed to have brightness variations because of the spots, and that this can "closely resemble" the presence of an exoplanet. So the question is, to get the same amplitude in brightness variation, what planet radius would produce that.

Wait, but photometric observations of a planet transit would cause a dip in brightness when the planet moves in front of the star. The amount of dip depends on the area blocked. But in the case of spots, the dip would also depend on the area of the spot and the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the observed change in brightness is due to the spots being cooler. So when the spots are facing us, the total flux is lower because a part of the star (which is cooler) is being observed. When the star rotates and the spots are on the far side, the flux returns to normal. So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference in flux when the spots are visible vs. when they aren't.

But wait, another thought: when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the star's apparent brightness would decrease. So the dip in brightness would be proportional to the area of the spots times the difference in their brightness compared to the rest of the star.

So to model this, perhaps the change in brightness (delta F) is the area of the spots times (F_spot - F_unspotted) / F_total.

Wait, more accurately, the unspotted star emits F_total = sigma Teff^4 * surface area.

When the spots are visible, the emitting area is (1 - filling factor) * A_total + filling factor * A_spot, where A_spot is the area of the spots. But wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of spots is filling factor * (2π R^2) perhaps? Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, so area is 2π R^2.

Wait, the star has radius R_star = R_sun. So each hemisphere has an area of 2π R^2. The filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Wait, but when the star rotates, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. So the observed flux would be the normal flux minus the flux lost due to the spots.

The flux from the star is normally F_total = sigma T_eff^4 * (4π R^2) / (4π D^2) ), where D is distance. But since we're considering relative changes, the distance D will cancel out.

The flux from the star when the spots are visible is F_obs = (F_total - F_spots), where F_spots is the flux emitted by the spots.

The flux from the spots would be sigma T_spot^4 * A_spots, where A_spots is the area of the spots.

Wait, let me clarify. The spots are cooler, T_spot = Teff - 1000 K? Wait, no, the question says temperature difference is 1000 K. So T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So F_spots = sigma T_spot^4 * A_spots.

Similarly, the normal flux from that area would have been sigma T_eff^4 * A_spots.

So the difference in flux is delta F = (sigma T_eff^4 * A_spots) - (sigma T_spot^4 * A_spots) ) = sigma A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the observed flux when the spots are visible is F_obs = F_total - delta F.

The observed flux when spots are not visible (i.e., when the other hemisphere is facing us) is F_total.

The change in flux when the spots are present is delta F = F_total - F_obs = sigma A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

But wait, F_total is sigma T_eff^4 * 4π R^2. No, wait, F_total is the total flux from the entire star. So when the spots are on the far side, we see all the star's surface as normal. When they're on the front, we lose the flux from the spots.

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is:

delta F = F_unspotted - F_spotted = (F_total - F_spotted) - F_spotted? No, wait, no. When the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted = F_total - (F_unspotted - F_spotted_part).

Wait, perhaps it's better to model F_spotted as the flux when the spots are in view, and F_unspotted as when they are not. The change is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait, F_unspotted is when the spotty hemisphere is not facing us, so the entire star is at Teff. So F_unspotted = F_total.

F_spotted is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. So in that case, the area of the star that is spotted (A_spots) is emitting at T_spot instead of Teff. So F_spotted = F_total - (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * (A_spots / (4π R^2)) * sigma * 4π R^2.

Wait, maybe another approach. The total flux from the star is sigma Teff^4 multiplied by the surface area of the star, which is 4π R^2.

When the spots are visible, the flux is the total flux minus the flux that comes from the spots (since the spots are cooler). The flux from the spots when they are visible is sigma T_spot^4 * A_spots.

So the change in flux when the spots are visible is delta F = F_unspotted - F_spotted = [sigma Teff^4 (4π R^2)] - [sigma Teff^4 (4π R^2) - sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) A_spots]

Wait, that can't be right because when the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted = F_total - (delta F), so F_spotted = F_total - [sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) A_spots ]

So the change is delta F = F_unspotted - F_spotted = sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) A_spots.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is delta F / F_total.

So delta F = sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) A_spots

F_total = sigma Teff^4 * 4π R^2

So amplitude is (delta F) / F_total = [A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4π R^2 Teff^4]

Simplify that: [A_spots / (4π R^2)] * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

A_spots is the area of the spots, which is filling factor times the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is filling_factor * area of hemisphere.

Each hemisphere has area 2π R^2, so A_spots = 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Wait, wait, filling factor is 20%, so 0.2. So A_spots = 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Now, putting that into the amplitude:

Amplitude = [ (0.4 π R^2) / (4 π R^2) ) ] * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Simplify:

0.4 π R^2 / 4 π R^2 = 0.4/4 = 0.1

Then, (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(0.8333)^4 is about (0.8333)^2 = 0.6944, squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So the amplitude becomes 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, or about 5.177% change.

Wait, but wait, that's the amplitude when the spots are visible. But the maximum dip would be this value. So the amplitude A = 0.05177, or about 5.18%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used 0.2 as the filling factor, but wait no, because the area of the spots is 0.2 of the hemisphere. The hemisphere is 2π R², so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But let me double-check the math.

So the amplitude is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4)= 0.1 * (1 - (625/1296)).

Wait, 625/1296 is approximately 0.48225.

So 1-0.48225=0.51775.

So 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775, which is approximately 5.1775% amplitude.

Wait, but the problem is comparing this to the amplitude produced by a planet transit. So when a planet transits, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the planet blocks that area. But wait, no, actually, the dip in flux is (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (1 - (T_planet / T_star)^4 ), but wait, wait, the planet doesn't emit any light. So the dip is just (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the planet blocks that part of the star, which emits at T_star.

Wait, that's correct. Because the planet doesn't emit, the dip is the area blocked times the flux per unit area of the star. So the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2, because the planet blocks that area, and the star emits F = sigma T^4 per unit area.

So the dip depth is (R_p / R_star)^2.

Wait, but in the case of the star spots, the amplitude is about 5.1775%, which is the dip when the spots are visible. So to get the same amplitude, the planet's dip should be equal to that.

So (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.051775

Take the square root of both sides:

R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, 0.2275 is approximately 0.23. But looking at the options:

Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of these match 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, let me go back.

The amplitude in the case of the spots is the change in flux when the spots are visible compared to when they're not. So the amplitude in brightness variation would be the difference between F_unspotted and F_spotted.

F_unspotted is when the entire star is emitting at Teff. F_spotted is when the spots are covering a part of the star, so the flux is F_total - (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * (A_spots / (4π R^2)) * 4π R^2.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to model the flux when the spots are visible as:

F_spotted = F_total * (1 - filling_factor * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) )

So the amplitude is F_unspotted - F_spotted = F_total * filling_factor * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) )

So the relative change is (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted = filling_factor * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)) )

So, plugging numbers:

filling_factor = 0.2

T_spot = 5000 K

Teff = 6000 K

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355, or about 10.355% amplitude.

Wait, that's a 10% dip. So the amplitude is approximately 10%.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the spots' area, I got about 5% dip. So which approach is correct?

I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the filling factor is 0.2 of the hemisphere, but when the star rotates, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire area of the spots is visible, but when it's not, the spots are on the far side. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the relative flux change when the spots are positioned such that their area is visible to us. So the flux when the spots are visible is F_spotted = F_unspotted - delta_F.

So delta_F is the flux from the area that is covered by spots, but at a lower temperature.

So delta_F = (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * (A_spots / (4π R^2)) ) * sigma * 4π R^2.

Wait, that's complicated, but perhaps the relative change is (delta_F) / F_unspotted.

delta_F = (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * A_spots / (4π R^2) * 4π R^2? No, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of F = sigma T^4 * A.

So F_unspotted is sigma T_eff^4 * 4π R^2.

F_spotted is sigma T_eff^4 * (4π R^2 - A_spots) + sigma T_spot^4 * A_spots.

So the change is F_unspotted - F_spotted = sigma T_eff^4 * A_spots - sigma T_spot^4 * A_spots.

= sigma A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the relative change is (sigma A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (sigma T_eff^4 * 4π R^2).

Cancel sigma:

= (A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (T_eff^4 * 4π R^2 )

= (A_spots / (4π R^2 )) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) 

= (filling_factor * 2π R^2 / (4 π R^2 )) ) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4))

Simplify:

filling_factor * (2π R^2 / 4 π R^2 ) = filling_factor * (2/4) ) = filling_factor * 0.5.

So:

relative change = 0.2 * 0.5 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

= 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775, which is about 5.1775%.

Wait, so earlier I thought this would be the amplitude, but another approach gave me 10% amplitude. So which is correct?

Wait no, the relative change is the difference between F_unspotted and F_spotted. So when the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted = F_unspotted - delta_F.

So the amplitude of the dip would be delta_F / F_unspotted = 5.1775%.

Ah, but perhaps I got the relative change wrong. Let me think: when the spots are visible, the flux is lower, so the observed flux is F_spotted. So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted = delta_F.

So the amplitude is delta_F / F_unspotted = 0.051775, which is ~5.18%.

Therefore, for the planet transit, the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2, and we set this equal to 0.051775.

So R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, which is ~0.23.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, which is 0.32, and option A) ~0.39. Hmm, but none of the options match 0.23.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I calculate the spot area.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Each hemisphere is 2π R², so A_spots = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star is viewed, the entire hemisphere is visible. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the area of the star that is spotted is 0.4 π R².

But the total area of the star is 4π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10%.

So the area blocking is 10% of the star's surface. So the amplitude of the dip should be 10% multiplied by (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

Wait, wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to model it again.

The maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted area is in front. The spotted area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The total area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star's area covered by spots when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

So the area blocked is 10% of the star's surface. But the spots are cooler, so the flux from that area is less.

So the maximum dip in brightness is the area blocked times the difference in flux per unit area.

The flux per unit area from the star is sigma T_eff^4.

The flux per unit area from the spots is sigma T_spot^4.

So the difference is sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) per unit area.

So the total dip in flux is:

delta F = A_blocked * sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )

Where A_blocked is the area of the spots visible, which is 0.4 pi R².

The total flux from the star is F_total = 4 pi R² * sigma T_eff^4.

So the relative dip is delta F / F_total = [0.4 pi R² * sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [4 pi R² sigma T_eff^4 ]

Simplify:

= [0.4 * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [4 T_eff^4 ]

= 0.1 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) 

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, so about 5.1775%.

So the amplitude is ~5.18%. 

Now, for the planet transit, the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2. So 

(Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

So approximately 0.23 Rstar.

Looking at the options, we have option D) ~0.32, which is larger than 0.23, and option A) ~0.39, which is higher, but there's no option around 0.23. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Because when a planet transits, it's a circular area blocking the star, but the spots are a coverage on a hemisphere. Did I account for that correctly?

Wait, no, perhaps the approach is correct because the area blocked by the planet is the same as the area of the spots in this calculation. So the dip due to the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, and the dip due to the spots is 0.051775.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation should not use (R_p/Rstar)^2 but instead consider the brightness variation in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the "filling factor" is not 20% of the hemisphere, but 20% of the entire star. Because the question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2.

Hmm, but I think I calculated that correctly.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm comparing the wrong amplitudes. The brightness variation due to the spots is periodic, but in the case of a planet, the transit is a one-time dip during the orbit. But the question says that the amplitude should be the same. So perhaps I'm correct.

But the calculation gives Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.23, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the temperature difference is 1000 K, but the spots are cooler, which reduces the flux. So the amplitude is higher than just the area blocked because the spots are dimmer.

Wait, in the planet case, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. In the spot case, the dip is (filling factor * area fraction) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Wait, the spot's area fraction is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1.

So the amplitude is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) = 0.051775.

So the planet's dip would have to be 0.051775 in amplitude, which is about 5.18%.

So, R_p / Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the area of the spots. Let me re-express.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the filling factor as a fraction of the entire star's surface, not the hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

Wait, but the star's total surface is 4 pi R². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 pi R² of the star's surface. So the fraction is 0.4 pi / 4 pi = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

That's correct.

So, the dip is 10% times (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 5.1775%.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have 0.23. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (5/6)^4 more accurately.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So 0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747.

So sqrt(0.0517747) is approximately?

Let me calculate it more accurately.

0.0517747 = 5.17747e-2.

Taking square root:

sqrt(5.17747e-2) = approx 0.2275.

Which is about 0.23.

Looking again at the options, perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip when they're on the near side. But maybe the observed brightness variation is twice the dip I calculated, because when the spots are on the far side, the flux is normal, and when on the near side, it's lower. So the amplitude is the difference between these two.

Wait, no, no, the amplitude is the maximum dip. So when the spots are visible, the flux is lower than when they're not. So the amplitude is the magnitude of that dip, which is 5.1775%.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the spots are on the near side, the flux is lower, and when they're on the far side, the flux is higher? No, because when the spots are on the far side, the spots are not visible; the star appears as usual. So the flux when spots are on the near side is lower than when they're on the far side.

So the maximum dip is 5.1775%.

So the planet's transit would have to cause the same dip.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

None of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the effective area is calculated as the filling factor times the area, but perhaps the flux change is calculated differently.

Wait, when a spot is present, the flux we receive is less. So the dip is:

delta F = (A_spots / A_total) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

So delta F = (0.2 * 2 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) * (1 - (5/6)^4 )

= (0.4 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) * 0.51775.

= 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the dip but the change in brightness. Wait, in the case of the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So in the star's case, the dip is 0.051775. So the planet's radius should be sqrt(0.051775) times Rstar, which is approximately 0.2275 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to model the brightness variation differently. Because the star's brightness varies as it rotates, but the planet's transit is a single dip. So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation is larger than the dip.

Wait, another thought: if the star has spots on one hemisphere, when it rotates, the spots come into view. The brightness variation would be the difference between when the spots are visible and when they aren't. So the amplitude would be the change in flux.

Wait, when the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_total. When they are on the near side, the flux is F_total - delta_F.

So the amplitude would be delta_F.

But when the planet transits, it blocks some of the flux, causing a dip of (Rp^2 / Rstar^2).

So the amplitude of the dip in the planet's transit is (Rp^2/Rstar^2) * F_total. The amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is delta_F = (A_spots) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) sigma.

Wait, perhaps to compare the two, the amplitude of the brightness variation from the spots is the same as the dip from the planet. So,

delta_F = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * F_total.

But what is delta_F? It's (A_spots) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) sigma.

But F_total is 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So,

A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) sigma = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Cancel sigma:

A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * 4 pi R^2 Teff^4.

But A_spots = filling_factor * 2 pi R^2 = 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So,

0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) = (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) * 4 pi R^2 Teff^4.

Divide both sides by 4 pi R^2 Teff^4:

(0.4 pi R^2 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4 pi R^2 Teff^4) ) = Rp^2 / Rstar^2.

Simplify:

0.4 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / (4 Teff^4) ) = Rp^2 / Rstar^2.

0.1 (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4 = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So,

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4)).

As before, this gives 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.051775.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is 20% of its surface (the filling factor is 20% of the entire star). Let me try that.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then A_spots = 0.2 * 4 pi R^2.

Wait, but the problem states that the spots are on one hemisphere. So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the spot area.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4 pi R^2. Each hemisphere has 2 pi R^2.

The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So spot area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.1, or 10%.

So the dip is 10% of the star's surface, multiplied by (1 - (5/6)^4) → 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 5.1775%.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

But again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the spot's area as 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. Let's try that.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, then A_spots = 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

Then the fraction is 0.8 pi R^2 / 4 pi R^2 = 0.2.

Dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, which is 10.355%.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D.

But the problem says the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so this scenario isn't correct. But perhaps the problem statement is ambiguous.

Wait, the problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So perhaps the correct answer is 0.23, which is not an option, but the closest is D) 0.32.

But in the calculation where the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, we get 0.32, which is option D.

But this contradicts the problem statement, which says the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula in a different way.

Wait, another possibility: the effective amplitude is the change in flux when the spot is on the near side versus when it's on the far side. So when the spot is on the far side, the star appears at full brightness. When the spot is on the near side, the star's brightness is lower by the spot's contribution.

So the amplitude is the difference between these two fluxes.

Flux when spot is on near side: F_spotted = F_total - (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * (A_spots / (4 pi R^2)) * 4 pi R^2 sigma.

Wait, no, F_spotted = (F_total - F_spotted_area).

F_spotted_area = A_spots * sigma T_spot^4.

So the amplitude is (F_total - F_spotted) = A_spots (sigma Teff^4 - sigma T_spot^4).

Relative amplitude is [A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)] / F_total.

Which again gives us the same 0.051775.

So I think the calculation is correct, but perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius relative to the star's radius, but in terms of area: (R_p / R_star )^2. But no, the question says Rpl/Rstar.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation when the spots are on the far side. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots cause a dip when they are on the near side, but the star's normal brightness is higher when the spots are on the far side. So the amplitude is the difference between the normal flux and the spotted flux, which is 5.1775%.

But the options don't have 0.23, so perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to be viewed as a circular area, but the actual coverage is more complex. Howver, the problem states the filling factor, so that's the fraction.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation is the maximum when the center of the spot is facing us, but the actual area covered is more than a circle. But the filling factor is given, so perhaps it's accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spot covers 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere. So if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then the area is 0.2 * 4 pi R^2 = 0.8 pi R^2.

Then, the fraction is 0.8 pi R^2 /4 pi R^2 = 0.2.

So the relative dip is 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32. So option D.

But according to the problem, the filling factor is relative to the hemisphere. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the spots to cover 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. Perhaps the way the question is phrased is ambiguous. If that's the case, then the correct answer would be D) ~0.32.

Since the options don't have 0.23, perhaps the intended approach was to assume the filling factor is 20% of the entire star. So in that case, the answer is D.

But given that the problem says the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation I did, which leads to Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.23, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D) 0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the spotty hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor of 20%**.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is caused by the difference in flux between when the spots are visible and when they are not.
   - The flux from the star is proportional to its surface area and temperature: \( F \propto T^4 \).
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is given by:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{\text{Area of Spots}}{\text{Total Surface Area of Star}} \right) \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]

3. **Area Calculations**:
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The area of one hemisphere is \( 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The area of the spots is \( 0.2 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Area of Spots}}{\text{Total Surface Area of Star}} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{4 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.1.
     \]

4. **Temperature Ratio**:
   - The temperature ratio is \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \).
   - The term \( \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225.
     \]
   - Thus, \( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \approx 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775 \).

5. **Amplitude Calculation**:
   - Substituting into the amplitude formula:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 0.1 \cdot 0.51775 \approx 0.051775.
     \]
   - This represents the fractional change in brightness due to the spots.

6. **Exoplanet Transit Amplitude**:
   - For a planet transiting the star, the amplitude of the brightness dip is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2.
     \]
   - Setting the planet transit amplitude equal to the spot-induced amplitude:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.051775.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275.
     \]

7. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - The closest option is **D) ~0.32**, which suggests that the problem may assume the filling factor applies to the entire star rather than just one hemisphere. If the filling factor were 20% of the entire star's surface, the amplitude calculation would yield a slightly larger value, consistent with option D.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in interpreting the filling factor and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is **D) ~0.32**.

Answer: D
