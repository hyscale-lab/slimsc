Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, the problem says they found the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's radiation is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, that means their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max * T = constant, so if λ_max is the same, T must be the same.

Wait, but wait. The stars have different masses and radii. How does that affect their luminosity? Oh right, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same temperature (because their λ_max are same), the luminosity ratio would then be (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, that part cancels out, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Let me plug in the numbers. R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that gives 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, D) ~2.23... Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something else here.

Wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, but how does radial velocity affect this? Oh, because when a star is moving, it causes a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength would be affected. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So they observed the same λ_max for both stars.

Wait, but if the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths would be shifted. So the actual emitted wavelength (rest wavelength) would be different. Because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength.

Wait, so let me think again. Suppose the star is moving towards or away from us. The observed wavelength λ_obs is given by the Doppler formula: λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), where v_r is the radial velocity (v_r positive if moving away, negative towards us).

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1 has v_r 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. Star_2 has v_r 700 km/s. So for Star_2, the observed λ_max is same as Star_1's, but its actual emitted (rest) λ_max would be different. Because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let me denote:

For Star_1: v_r1 = 0. So λ_max1_obs = λ_max1_rest.

For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. So λ_max2_obs = λ_max1_obs, since problem states that both have same observed λ_max.

So from Doppler shift: λ_max2_obs = λ_max2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r2) / (1 - v_r2) ) )

Wait, but wait, the Doppler shift formula I'm a bit hazy on. Let me recall: the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when the source is moving away. If moving towards, the denominator would have (1 + v/c) in numerator.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, it's often approximated as (1 + v/c) for non-relativistic speeds. But 700 km/s is pretty fast, so maybe we can't neglect relativistic effects. Wait, but 700 km/s is 0.7 million meters per second. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is about 0.0023c. So small, but not negligible. Hmm, perhaps we can use the approximation for small velocities.

Wait, alternatively, the Doppler shift formula for radial velocity is approximately: (λ_obs - λ_rest)/λ_rest ≈ v_r / c, but this is when v_r is small compared to c. So if the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), the velocity is positive (moving away).

Alternatively, the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) when moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength.

Wait, but according to the problem, both stars have the same observed wavelength. Star_1 is at rest (v_r=0), so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. Star_2 is moving away (v_r2=700 km/s), so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can write:

λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) ) = λ_rest1.

But from earlier, because their observed λ_max are same, which includes the Doppler shift.

But earlier, I thought that because λ_rest_max is proportional to 1/T, so if their rest wavelengths are different, their temperatures would be different. But wait, no, because the observed λ_max is same, but the rest λ_max would be different due to Doppler.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me see.

Wait, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So star's rest frame λ_max is b/T.

But when observed, it's shifted by Doppler.

So for Star_1: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But the problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ_rest1 is b/T1, and λ_rest2 is b/T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

The b's cancel:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Wait, that's the temperature relation between the two stars.

But from the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L is proportional to R² T⁴.

So, L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4.

We know R1/R2 is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T1/T2 is sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * ( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )^2

Now, v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2/c.

v2 = 700 km/s.

c is approx 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333...

So, v2/c ≈ 0.023333.

So,

(1 - v2/c) = 1 - 0.023333 ≈ 0.976667

(1 + v2/c) = 1 + 0.023333 ≈ 1.023333

So,

(1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) ≈ 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ let's compute this.

0.976667 / 1.023333.

Let me compute that:

0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ (approx 0.976667 / 1.023333) = Let's compute 0.976667 / 1.023333.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1.023333:

0.976667 ≈ (1.023333) * (0.954) → wait, perhaps compute directly.

0.976667 ÷ 1.023333 ≈ approximately 0.954.

Wait, let me compute 1.023333 * 0.954.

1.023333 * 0.954: 1 *0.954 = 0.954; 0.023333 * 0.954 ≈ 0.022266. Total≈0.976266. Which is close to 0.976667.

So the ratio is approx 0.954.

So, sqrt( (1-v/c)/(1+v/c) ) = sqrt(0.954) ≈ 0.9766.

So T1 = T2 * 0.9766.

Therefore, (T1/T2) = 0.9766.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.9766)^4.

Let me compute 0.9766^2 first.

0.9766^2: about 0.9766 * 0.9766.

Let me compute 0.9766 * 0.9766:

= (0.9766)^2 

I'll compute 9766 * 9766 and then adjust.

Wait, perhaps approximate:

0.9766 ≈ 0.98 approx.

0.98^2 = 0.9604.

But more accurately, let's compute 0.9766 * 0.9766.

Compute 0.9766 * 0.9766:

Compute 9766 * 9766.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute (1 - 0.0234)^2 = 1 - 2 * 0.0234 + (0.0234)^2 ≈ 0.9532 + 0.00054756 ≈ 0.95374756.

Wait, no, wait: (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So (1 - 0.0234)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.0234) + (0.0234)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0468 + 0.00054756 ≈ 0.95374756.

Wait, but our value is 0.9766, which is 0.9766 = 1 - 0.0234.

So, (0.9766)^2 ≈ 0.9537.

Then, (0.9766)^4 = (0.9537)^2.

Compute 0.9537 squared.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

0.9537 is 0.95 + 0.0037.

(0.95 + 0.0037)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2 *0.95*0.0037 + (0.0037)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.00703 + 0.00001369 ≈ 0.9025 + 0.00703 = 0.90953, plus 0.00001369 is ~0.90954.

So (0.9766)^4 ≈ 0.9095.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9095.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9095 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9095.

Compute 2 * 0.9095 = 1.819, 0.25 *0.9095=0.227375. Summing gives 1.819 + 0.227375 = 2.046375.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 2.04... Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, no. Let me see. Because I'm computing L1/L2 as 2.25 multiplied by (T1/T2)^4, which is 0.9095. 2.25 * 0.9095 is about 2.25 * 0.9 is 2.025, 2.25 * 0.0095 is about 0.021375. So 2.025 + 0.0214= ~2.0464. So approximately 2.05.

But wait, the options are about 2.23, 2.25, etc. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift part. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the problem says that the stars appear brightest at same observed wavelength. So the observed λ_max for both is same. But for Star_1, which has v_r=0, λ_rest1 = λ_obs1. For Star_2, which has v_r=700 km/s, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

So,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But both λ_obs are same: λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which can be rearranged as:

λ_rest2 = λ_rest1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest is inversely proportional to T. So,

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = T2 / T1.

Wait, wait, no: λ_rest = b/T. So λ_rest1 = b/T1, λ_rest2 = b/T2.

So,

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = (b/T1) / (b/T2) ) = T2/T1.

So,

T2 / T1 = [sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )]

Which implies,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that for Star_2, the observed λ is longer than its rest λ, implying a redshift. So Star_2 is moving away, so its rest λ must be shorter than the observed λ. Wait, no, wait: when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v/c) approximation.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in the Doppler shift expression. Let me get the exact formula.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, the correct formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) )

Wait, no, actually, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, another source says it's λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) when v << c.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula.

So, for Star_2, moving away with velocity v₂ = 700 km/s, so:

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v₂/c) / (1 - v₂/c) )

But λ_obs2 = λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c) )

But λ_rest1 = b / T1; λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v₂/c)/(1 - v₂/c) )

→ T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v₂/c)/(1 + v₂/c) )

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v₂/c) / (1 + v₂/c) )

Let me compute this term.

v₂ =700 km/s; c=3e5 km/s → v₂/c=700/3e5 = 0.002333...

So,

(1 - v₂/c) = 0.9976666...

(1 + v₂/c) = 1.0023333...

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.9976666 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.99533.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

0.9976666 / 1.0023333.

Let me compute this as (1 -0.0023333) / (1 +0.0023333) ≈ [ (1 - x) ] / (1 +x ), where x=0.0023333.

This is approximately (1 - x)(1 - x) ) when x is small (since (1 -x)/(1 +x) ≈ (1 -2x) for small x).

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the division.

So, 0.9976666 ÷ 1.0023333 ≈ Let's compute this.

Let me compute 1.0023333 * 0.99533 = ? 1.0023333 * 0.99533.

Compute 1 * 0.99533 = 0.99533.

0.0023333 * 0.99533 ≈ 0.002322.

So sum is approximately 0.99533 + 0.002322 ≈ 0.99765. Which is close to 0.9976666.

So (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ 0.99533.

So sqrt(0.99533) ≈ 0.99766.

So, T1 = T2 * 0.99766.

So, T1/T2 = 0.99766.

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99766)^4.

Compute 0.99766^2: (approx) since 0.99766 is close to 1, 0.99766^2 ≈ (1 - 0.00234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2 ≈ 0.99528 + 0.00000548 ≈ approximately 0.995285.

Then, square it again: (0.995285)^2 ≈ ?

Compute 0.995285^2.

Again, using (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a=0.004715.

So, 0.995285 = 1 - 0.004715.

So, (0.995285)^2 = (1 - 0.004715)^2 = 1 - 2*0.004715 + (0.004715)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00943 + 0.00002223 ≈ 0.99059223.

Wait, that can't be right because 0.995285^2 is about 0.9906, but wait 0.995 is about 0.990025, so 0.995^2=0.990025. So 0.995285^2 would be slightly higher.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 0.995285 * 0.995285.

Calculate 0.995285 * 0.995285:

= (0.995 * 0.995) + (0.000285 * 0.995)*2 + (0.000285)^2.

0.995 *0.995 = (1 - 0.005)^2 = 1 - 0.01 + 0.000025 = 0.990025.

Then, 0.000285 * 0.995 = approximately 0.000283575. Multiply by 2 → 0.00056715.

Then, (0.000285)^2 ≈ 8.1225e-8.

So summing up: 0.990025 + 0.00056715 = 0.99059215 + 8e-8 → approximately 0.9905922.

So (0.99766)^4 ≈ 0.9905922.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.99766)^4.

Wait, (1.5)^2 is 2.25.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9905922 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9905922 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 0.9905922.

First, 2 *0.9905922 = 1.9811844.

0.25 *0.9905922 = 0.247648.

Sum: 1.9811844 + 0.247648 = 2.2288324.

Approximately 2.2288.

Looking at the options: Option D is ~2.23, option A is ~2.25.

So the computed factor is approximately 2.23, which matches option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because when I approximated v2/c as 0.002333, I used (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ 0.9976666/1.0023333 ≈ 0.99533.

But perhaps a more precise calculation is needed for the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps using the non-relativistic approximation.

In the non-relativistic limit, the Doppler shift for a star moving away is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

But since λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, and λ_obs2 = λ_obs1,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c )

So,

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = (1 + v2/c )

But,

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = (b / T1) / (b / T2) ) = T2 / T1.

So,

T2 / T1 = 1 + v2/c → T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Wait, no, that's conflicting with previous conclusion.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-do this.

In non-relativistic Doppler approximation, when source is moving away, λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c).

So,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 (1 + v2/c )

Since λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, and λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 + v2/c )

So,

λ_rest1 / λ_rest2 = 1 + v2/c.

But,

λ_rest1 = b/T1, λ_rest2 = b/T2.

So,

(λ_rest1)/(λ_rest2) = T2/(T1) =1 + v2/c.

So,

T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c )

Which implies,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1/(1 + v2/c )

Which, for v2/c = 0.002333,

1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T1/T2 ≈ 1/1.002333 ≈ 0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9906.

Then,

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (2.25) * (0.9906) ≈ 2.228.

Which is about 2.23, matching option D.

So the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.


Astronomers are analyzing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and a mass 1.5 times greater. Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, while Star_1 is stationary. The goal is to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, assuming the stars radiate as blackbodies.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Temperature Relation**:  
   The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its temperature by Wien's law:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]  
   Since the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars, the rest wavelengths must differ due to the Doppler effect. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\). Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest, 2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
   \]  
   Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs, 2}}\), it follows that:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{rest, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest, 2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
   \]  
   Using \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T\), the temperature ratio is:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
   \]  
   Substituting \(v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333\):  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} \approx \sqrt{0.99533} \approx 0.99766
   \]

2. **Luminosity Relation**:  
   The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L \propto R^2 T^4
   \]  
   For Star_1 and Star_2:  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]  
   Substituting \(R_1 / R_2 = 1.5\) and \((T_1 / T_2)^4 = (0.99766)^4 \approx 0.9906\):  
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot 0.9906 = 2.25 \cdot 0.9906 \approx 2.228
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:  
   The computed luminosity ratio is approximately \(2.23\), which matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**. 

Answer: D
