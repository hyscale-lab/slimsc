Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the setup: Two stars, same mass as each other, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass like Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets based on the RV method measurements.

Wait, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little, and the spectral lines shift. The shift depends on the star's velocity towards or away from us.

So, the problem says that Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. And we need to find how much longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1. So the ratio Period2 / Period1 = ?

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. K is the maximum velocity of the star in the direction of the observer. The formula I vaguely recall is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^2 ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 year)) ) — wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I think the formula for K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c T) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to consider the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period. Because both stars are the same mass, and the planets have same mass, so maybe the K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the formula for K. The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to remember that K is proportional to (
