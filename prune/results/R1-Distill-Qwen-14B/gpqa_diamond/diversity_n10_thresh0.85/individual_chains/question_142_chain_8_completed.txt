Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. Hmm, let me think step by step.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ><ψ|, but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so their density matrices are more complicated.

Wait, the given ρ looks like it's a mixture of the states |0> and |1>. Since each term is multiplied by 1/2, that suggests it's a classical mixture, right? So each state has equal probability. So ρ is a mixed state with 50% |0> and 50% |1>.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector in 3D space. The Bloch vector has components (x, y, z), and it's mapped to the state (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the density matrix for a pure qubit state |θ, φ> is (|0> + e^{iφ}|1>) e^{-iφ} /2, but when written in terms of the Bloch sphere, it's (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector with magnitude less than or equal to 1.

For a pure state, the density matrix would have ρ^2 = ρ. Let me check the given ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute ρ squared. Since |0> and |1> are orthogonal, <0|1> is zero. So ρ squared is (1/2)^2 (|0><0|0><0| + |0><0|1><1| + |1><1|0><0| + |1><1|1><1| )) = (1/4)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, no, that's not correct because |0><0| is already a projector, so when you apply it twice, it's the same as once. So (|0><0|)^2 = |0><0|, same for |1>. So ρ squared would be (1/4)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (1/4) ρ. So ρ squared is (1/4)ρ, which is not equal to ρ unless ρ is zero, which it isn't. Therefore, this is a mixed state.

So since it's a mixed state, the Bloch vector r will have a length less than 1. But wait, density matrices can be written as (I + r·σ)/2. Let me see. Let me compute the given ρ and express it in terms of the Pauli matrices.

The standard basis for 2x2 matrices can be written using the Pauli matrices. Let me recall the basis:

I is the identity matrix,
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]],
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]],
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (1/2)(I). Because |0><0| + |1><1| = I.

Therefore, ρ is (I)/2. So this is a completely mixed state, also known as the maximally mixed state. The maximally mixed state has the Bloch vector r of zero, because (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 when r=0.

Wait, so (I + r·σ)/2 is the general form for density matrices. So if ρ is I/2, then that would mean r is zero. So the Bloch vector is at the origin. So the point is (0,0,0), which is option C.

Let me double-check. Another way to see it: the density matrix for the completely mixed state is (I)/d, where d is the dimension. Here, d=2, so it's I/2. So yes, it's the maximally mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere, i.e., the origin.

So looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → That's r of length sqrt(2), which would be a pure state beyond the Bloch sphere's radius of 1.

B) (0,0,1) → That's the state |0>, but in our case, it's mixed, so not this.

C) (0,0,0) → Correct for the maximally mixed state.

D) (1,1,1) → That's even longer than A, so not possible.

So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state corresponds to equal probabilities for the qubit to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), which is consistent with the equal weights of \(1/2\) in the density matrix.

In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector \((x, y, z)\) in 3D space, where the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) satisfies \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\). For pure states, \(|\mathbf{r}| = 1\), while for mixed states, \(|\mathbf{r}| < 1\). The maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

To confirm, the density matrix \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\) (where \(I\) is the identity matrix) matches the form of the maximally mixed state. This state has no preferential direction in the Bloch sphere and is centered at the origin, corresponding to the point \((0, 0, 0)\).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \((1, 1, 0)\):** This corresponds to a pure state with a Bloch vector of length \(\sqrt{2}\), which exceeds the maximum radius of 1 for the Bloch sphere. Not correct.
- **B) \((0, 0, 1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), which is not a mixed state. Not correct.
- **C) \((0, 0, 0)\):** This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which matches the given density matrix. Correct.
- **D) \((1, 1, 1)\):** This corresponds to a pure state with a Bloch vector of length \(\sqrt{3}\), which exceeds the maximum radius of 1 for the Bloch sphere. Not correct.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
