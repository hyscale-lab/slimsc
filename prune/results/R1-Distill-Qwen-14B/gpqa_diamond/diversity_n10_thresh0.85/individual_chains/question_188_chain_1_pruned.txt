Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.

Hmm, I remember that in crystals, interplanar distances are calculated using the structure of the crystal lattice. A rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal, I think. So the lattice parameters are the same in all directions, but the angles between them are the same as well.

The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but wait, wait. In a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a type of hexahedron. So for a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal. Let's call this a = 10 Angstrom, since the interatomic distance is along the edge of the unit cell, I suppose.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. In a rhombohedron, the angles can be either all acute or all obtuse, but in this case, they are 30 degrees each. So each angle is 30 degrees.

I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + kl \cos \alpha + lh \cos \beta)}}}

Wait, no, wait. Or is it another formula? I'm a bit confused. Oh, right! The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{h}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{k}{b} \sin \alpha / \sin \beta \right)^2 + \left( \frac{l}{c} \sin \alpha \sin \gamma / (\sin \beta \sqrt{1 - (\sin \alpha \sin \gamma \sin \beta)^2}) ) \right)^2 } }

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should
