Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c? And X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Oh right, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, so if it's Li with 3 neutrons, then its atomic number is 3 and mass number 6. So that's Li-6, I think.

I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = γ * m₀c². So I need to find γ for a speed of 0.96c.

Wait, γ is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right? Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c, that's pretty close to the speed of light. So plugging into γ: 1 divided by sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Calculating (0.96)^2: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So γ is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, yes. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784, I think it's 0.28 because 28*28 is 784, so 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yeah, γ is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 can be looked up. I think the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), but wait, no, that's the mass number. Wait, the mass might be slightly less than 6 u because of binding energy, but for heavy ions, the rest mass is roughly the mass number times the atomic mass of a proton. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact value here.

Alternatively, I can use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me recall: the atomic mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So for a Li-6 nucleus, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so total of 6 nucleons. So the rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me calculate that.

6 * 938 is 5628 MeV,
