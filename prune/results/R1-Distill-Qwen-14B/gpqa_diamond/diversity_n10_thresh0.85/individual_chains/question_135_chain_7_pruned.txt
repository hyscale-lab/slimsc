Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but let me try to think it through.

So the question gives me a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh wait, perhaps it's L = -λ f ψ̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this is the interaction term between the boson X and some fermions.

Wait, the notation might be a bit tricky. The terms ψ_f and ψ_f̄ are the fermion fields. So the interaction is between X and fermions. The fermion here is ψ_f, right? So I think this means that the boson X couples to these fermions, which would mean that X can decay into these fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when considering decay possibilities, the rest mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of each fermion pair it's decaying into. Because for a particle to decay into two particles, each must have a mass less than or equal to half the parent's mass.

Wait, but wait. The question is about what fermions X can decay into. So I need to find which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

But wait, fermions have different masses. Let me list the masses of known fermions. Let me see:

- Electron (e^-): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ^-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ^-): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV (so ~0.002 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~3-5 MeV, say ~0.004 GeV
- Strange (s): ~95-105 MeV, ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173
