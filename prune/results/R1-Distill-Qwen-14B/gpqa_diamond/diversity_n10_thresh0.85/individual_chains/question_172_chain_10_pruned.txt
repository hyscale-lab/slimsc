Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation... right, it's something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by temperature. Oh wait, the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). But since the question is about the same element in two different stars, maybe the statistical weights are the same for both stars? Or does it matter here?

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Hmm, that's interesting. So E is about k_B * T? Wait, maybe not directly.

The problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the ratio of the populations is n1/n2 = 2. Let me assign variables: Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, but wait, in the Boltzmann equation, it's the difference between E levels. So if E is the higher energy level, then maybe n(E) / n_ground = (g_E/g_ground) * exp( - (E-E_ground)/(k T) ). But since both stars are in LTE, each has their own T.

Wait, the question says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me call that delta E = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J. So, for each star, the ratio of the excited to ground state (or whatever lower state) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star 1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-delta E/(k T1)). Similarly for star 2: n2_upper / n2_lower = same g factors * exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

But the problem states that n1_upper / n1_lower is twice that of n2_upper / n2_lower. Wait, no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." I think that means n_upper in star1 is twice that of star2. Or wait, maybe the ratio is (n_upper /n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper /n_lower)_2? Or perhaps the excitation is twice as much, meaning that n_upper is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, but let's think: in LTE, the ratio of populations depends exponentially on the temperature. So the ratio of the two ratios would be (n1_upper/n1_lower) / (n2_upper/n2_lower) = 2, because star_1's excitation is twice of star_2's.

So:
