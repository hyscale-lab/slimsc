Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots cover part of its surface. The key point is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that when a star has spots, those spots are cooler than the rest of the photosphere. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. Wait, but how does this affect the ionization of atoms and the populations of different energy levels?

Oh right, in stellar atmospheres, the ionization balance and population of energy levels depend on temperature. Since the spots are cooler, the surrounding areas might be hotter, but the overall effective temperature is lower. Wait, but the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think that the average temperature of the photosphere has gone down because a significant portion is covered by cooler spots.

So the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is given as n1/n2, the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, n1/n2 is lower than when they are not.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait, the ratio of the populations depends on the exponential term. Let me think. Let E2 be higher than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. Then, higher T would make the exponential smaller, which would mean the ratio n1/n2 increases? No, wait, because when T increases, the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(less negative) is larger. So n1/n2 would be larger at higher T if E2>E1.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So T decreases. Let me say T1 is 6000 K (no spots), T2 is 5500 K (with spots). Let’s calculate the ratio for both cases.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the star's overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Does that mean that the photosphere as a whole is at a lower temperature when spots are present? Or is there a mix of hot and cool regions? Hmm, the problem states that when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's effective temperature is lower because the spots are making it cooler on average.

So the effective temperature is what's given. So the relevant temperature for the photosphere is Teff, which is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, but wait, the spots are cooler regions, so in reality, the star's overall flux would be lower. Because the spots emit less flux, so the effective temperature is lower. So the effective temperature is an average, which would be lower when spots are present.

Now, the Boltzmann factor depends on the local temperature. But in this problem, it's given that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so each region emits according to its local temperature. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, those regions have a lower temperature, and the rest have the higher temperature.

Wait, but the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the average temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when the spots are present. But wait, no, because the star's overall effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity, which depends on the area and the temperature of each region.

Wait, no. The effective temperature is calculated from the total luminosity. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4 π R² σ Teff^4. When parts of the star are cooler, the total luminosity is less, so Teff would drop.

So the effective temperature of the star is 6000 K when no spots, and 5500 K when 40% of the surface is cooler.

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the photosphere has regions at different temperatures. But since the photosphere is in LTE, each region's Ti atoms are in local thermal equilibrium.

Wait, but the question is about the overall photosphere. Hmmm. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the star has regions at two different temperatures when spots are present. So how does that affect the overall ratio of Ti in the two levels?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying it by treating the entire photosphere as having a single temperature, which is the effective temperature. But that doesn't make much sense, because the actual temperature distribution is different. So perhaps the problem is considering that the effective temperature is the relevant parameter for determining the population ratio.

Wait, but the question states that the ratio observed decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So when T decreases from 6000 to 5500 K, the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

So to find the factor by which the ratio changes, we can compute (n1/n2)_6000K divided by (n1/n2)_5500K.

But wait, in the problem statement, the ratio n1/n2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots, implying that (n1/n2)_with_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = [ (n1/n2)_T1 ] / [ (n1/n2)_T2 ].

Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), assuming the same statistical weights. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the statistical weights (g1 and g2) are the same, so I think we can assume that they are the same or that their ratio is 1. Because the problem doesn't give any information about g1 and g2, so we can proceed under the assumption that g1/g2 = 1.

So the ratio (n1/n2) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential smaller. So (n1/n2) would decrease, which matches the observation.

So the factor is [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, let me compute that exponent.

Let me compute the exponent: -(E2-E1)/(k T1) + (E2-E1)/(k T2) )?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio (n1/n2) for T1 is exp( -(ΔE)/(k T1) ), and for T2 it's exp( -(ΔE)/(k T2) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So the ratio between (n1/n2)_T1 and (n1/n2)_T2 is [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ].

Which equals exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, I think that's correct. So the exponent is ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)).

But wait, since T2 is 5500 K and T1 is 6000 K, 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive, so the factor is e raised to a positive number, which means the factor is greater than 1. So (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = e^{ positive }, so the ratio is higher when T is higher, which matches our earlier conclusion.

But in the problem, the ratio when the star has spots (T=5500 K) is less than when it doesn't (T=6000 K). So the factor is (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = e^{ ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) }.

Now, the transition between the levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. I think this is the wavelength of the emitted photon when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1. So the energy difference ΔE is the energy of the photon, which can be found from E = hc/λ.

So let me compute ΔE. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Ångströms, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters, so 1.448e-7 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) ≈ (1.9878e-25 J·m) / 1.448e-7 m ≈ approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, I'm not sure if I should compute this in J or in eV. Since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so 1.373e-18 J is about 8.57 eV. Hmm, but wait, 13.6 eV is about the ionization energy of hydrogen, so 8.57 eV is a significant energy, but I think that's okay.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute E in Joules.

E = hc/(lambda) = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Yes, that's correct. So ΔE = 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Now, let's compute the exponent: (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

k is Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) is 1.373e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = approximately 1e5 / 1e23? Wait, no, let me compute:

1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e( -18 +23 ) → about 0.995 * 1e5 → approximately 99,500 K.

Wait, that's a huge number. Wait a second, that can't be right. Because 1e5 K is 100,000 K, but the temperatures we're dealing with are 5500 and 6000 K. So this would make the exponent very large.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1e-18 / 1e-23 is 1e5. So 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99,500.

Wait, so (ΔE)/(k) = ~99,500 K.

Hmm, but that seems too big. Let me cross-check the calculation. Wait, perhaps I should have used eV instead of J, because when dealing with atomic transitions, energies are often in eV.

So let's compute E in eV. E = hc/(lambda) in eV.

h in eVs·s is 4.135667696e-15 eV·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

lambda is 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

E = (4.1357e-15 eV·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

= (4.1357e-15 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7 eV·m/s * m → eV.

So numerator: 4.1357e-15 * 3e8 = 1.2407e-6.

Divide by 1.448e-7: 1.2407e-6 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 8.565 eV.

So ΔE is about 8.565 eV.

That makes more sense. So now, let's compute (ΔE)/(k_B), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K. k_B is approximately 8.617333262...e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/K = 8.565 eV / (8.6173e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.565 / 8.6173e-5 ≈ 8.565 * (1e5 / 8.6173) ≈ 8.565 * 11607 ≈ let's compute.

Wait, 8.565 * 11,607. Let me compute 8 * 11,607 = 92,856; 0.565 * 11,607 ≈ ~6,573. So total is approximately 99,429 K. So around 99,429 K.

Hmm, same as before, about 1e5 K.

Wait, so ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So now, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 99,429 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Let me compute 1/5500 and 1/6000.

1/5500 ≈ 1.81818e-4.

1/6000 ≈ 1.66667e-4.

The difference is about (1.81818e-4 - 1.66667e-4) = 0.15151e-4 = 1.5151e-5.

So the exponent is 99,429 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ let's compute.

99,429 * 1.5151e-5 = 99,429 * 0.000015151 ≈ approximately 1.507.

Wait, 99,429 * 0.000015151: Let's compute 1e5 * 0.000015151 = 1.5151. But since 99,429 is about 99.429 thousand, which is about 0.99429 times 1e5. So 0.99429 * 1.5151 ≈ approx 1.506.

So the exponent is about 1.506.

So the factor is e^1.506 ≈ e^1.5 is about 4.48.

Wait, e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is e * sqrt(e) ≈ 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ ~4.48.

So the factor is approximately 4.48. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is very close.

But wait, I should check my calculations again for any possible errors.

Let me redo the exponent calculation to make sure.

Compute 1/5500 -1/6000:

1/5500 = approximately 0.000181818.

1/6000 = approximately 0.000166667.

Difference: 0.000015151.

Multiply by 99,429 K: 0.000015151 * 99,429 ≈ 1.507.

So exponent is 1.507, so e^1.507 ≈ e^1.507.

Wait, let me compute e^1.507 more accurately.

We know that e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^1.5 is e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.64872 ≈ 4.4817.

But 1.507 is 1.5 + 0.007.

So e^0.007 ≈ 1 + 0.007 + (0.007)^2/2 ≈ 1.00700245.

So e^1.507 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.007 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.00700245 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ 4.4817 + (0.007 *4.4817) → 4.4817 + 0.03137 ≈ 4.513.

So approximately 4.513, which is about 4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation for population ratios in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\)):**  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 4.1357 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   E = \frac{(4.1357 \times 10^{-15}) (3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 8.565 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Ratio Factor:**  
   The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). Substituting \( \Delta E = 8.565 \, \text{eV} \) and \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \), we compute:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.565}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,429 \, \text{K}.
   \]
   The term \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Thus, the exponent becomes:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,429 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.507.
   \]

3. **Final Factor:**  
   The factor is:
   \[
   \exp(1.507) \approx 4.51.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots, and the factor by which this ratio changes is approximately **4.5**. This matches option **C**.

Answer: C
