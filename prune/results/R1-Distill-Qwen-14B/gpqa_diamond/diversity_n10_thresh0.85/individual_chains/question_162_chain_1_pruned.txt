Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that metrics describe the geometry of spacetime, and for calculating areas, we usually look at the spatial part. Here, it's a 2D metric because it only has dx and dy terms, so it's probably describing a 2-sphere or something similar.

Wait, a pseudosphere... Oh, right! A pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. When I think about metrics, the line element tells me about distances. This metric resembles something like the one for hyperbolic space. The standard metric for hyperbolic space in 2D can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model. Let me recall: the Poincaré disk model has ds² = (4/(1 - r²²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in that model.

Comparing that to the given metric, the structure looks similar. In the given case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Wait, so if I think in terms of x² + y², that's like r² where r is the usual polar coordinate. So perhaps in this metric, the radial part is √(x² + y²). So the denominator is 4 - r², where r² = x² + y².

Wait, but what is the radius of the pseudosphere? The question says radius r=2. Hmm, but in the Poincaré disk model, the curvature radius is related to the '4' in the denominator. Let me think. The standard Poincaré disk metric for hyperbolic space with curvature radius a is ds² = (a²/(a² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So in our case, the denominator is 4 - r², so a² is 4, meaning a is 2. So that matches the radius of the pseudosphere being 2. So this metric is indeed describing a pseudosphere of radius 2.

Now, the question is about the area of this pseudosphere. Wait, the area in hyperbolic geometry is different from spherical geometry. On a sphere of radius a, the area is 4πa². But hyperbolic space is unbounded, so what's the area of a pseudosphere?

Wait, a pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Because unlike a sphere, which is finite, a pseudosphere is like a hyperboloid that extends infinitely. So the area would be infinite. Or wait, does it have finite area? No, because as you go to the edge of the Poincaré disk (r approaches 2), the metric's denominator approaches zero, making the area element blow up. So the total area would be infinite.

Wait, but the given metric is for a particular model. The Poincaré disk model covers the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the area of the pseudosphere (which is the 2D hyperbolic plane) is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the area explicitly. The area element in the metric is (32)/(4 - x² -
