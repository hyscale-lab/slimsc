Okay, so I have to figure out the correct reagent sequence to synthesize this compound. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl means a triple bond attached to the cyclohexane ring. So the structure is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl (carbaldehyde) group. Wait, looking at the name: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, and the main ring also has a carbaldehyde group. Wait, maybe I should draw this.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to think that the main ring is cyclohexane, and at position 1, there's a group that's a hydroxymethyl attached to a cyclohexyl. Also, the main ring has a formyl (CHO) group. Or wait, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the target is a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons has two substituents: one is a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)CH2-) and the other is a formyl group. Wait, no, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means the cyclohexane ring has a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at the 1 position, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group. So the substituent is a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group attached? Wait, maybe it's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So the structure is CH2(OH)Cyclohexyl attached to the cyclohexane ring.

So, the target is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at position 1 that's a CH2OH connected to a cyclohexyl group. Or perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group where one substituent is OH and the other is cyclohexyl.

But maybe I should think about the synthesis steps. Starting from ethynylcyclohexane.

So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group. I need to form a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent.

I think the general plan is to functionalize the triple bond. Triple bonds can be manipulated via various reagents. Adding groups to the triple bond usually involves either alkyne additions or modifications.

Looking at the options, the reagents involve NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, O3, (CH3)2S, NH4OH, etc.

So, the first step in the options is either NaNH2 with methyl chloride or ethyl chloride. Or maybe something else. Let me think about what NaNH2 does. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. But in the presence of an alkyl halide, maybe it's an alkylation. Alternatively, NaNH2 can be used in the formation of Grignard reagents, but more commonly for deprotonating things like terminal alkynes.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a terminal alkyne (C≡CH). Treating that with a strong base like NaNH2 might deprotonate it to form a cyclohexyl acetylide.

Wait, but the first step in option A is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which then undergoes alkylation with methyl chloride. So the acetylide (strong base) would attack the methyl chloride (a methylating agent), adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡C-H attached to cyclohexane? No, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH3 group? Or is it CH2-C≡C-R? Wait, no. Let me correct that. Ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH substituent. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, no. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane directly attached to the triple bond? Like cyclohexyl-C≡CH? Yes, that's correct. So, structure is cyclohexane ring with a C≡CH group attached.

So, treating this with NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal alkyne, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻ Na⁺.

Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide. The acetylide is a strong base and would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the acetylide. So the product would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2Cl? Wait, no. Wait, the acetylide is at the end. So, the acetylide is R-C≡C⁻. When you add CH3Cl, you would get R-C≡C-CH3. So the triple bond becomes R-C≡C-CH3. So, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3, but that's a substituent on the cyclohexane.

So after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but in option C, the first step is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So that would give the alkylated acetylide.

Next step in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the triple bond. So, using H2 and a palladium catalyst (like Pd/CaCO3) would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, R-C≡C-CH3 would become R-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would typically give R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, H2 adds across triple bonds. So, a triple bond (sp-hybridized) becomes a single bond (sp3) after hydrogenation. So R-C≡C-CH3 -> R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the triple bond is between two carbons. So R-C≡C-CH3 would be R-C≡C-CH3. Adding H2 would add two Hs across triple bond, turning it into R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, wait, when you hydrogenate a triple bond, each H adds to each carbon. So R-C≡C-R' becomes R-CH2-CH2-R'. Wait, no. For ethynylcyclohexane, after alkylation, it's cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the triple bond is between the cyclohexyl and CH3. So, the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would make it cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not correct. Because hydrogenation of triple to single adds two Hs. So R-C≡C-R' becomes R-CH2-CH2-R'?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's consider a generic case. Let's say you have CH3-C≡C-CH3. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond to become CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is butane. Similarly, if you have R-C≡C-R', hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-R'.

So in this case, after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then, using H2 and Pd, it becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's just adding a methyl group to the ring via a single bond. So the product is cyclohexylpropane? Or perhaps it's cyclohexane with a -CH2CH2CH3 substituent?

Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexane attached to a CH2CH2CH3 group. But that's not correct because CH2CH2CH3 is the same as CH2CH2CH3, which is propane. So it's cyclohexane attached to a propane chain? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation step would actually add H's and make a single bond. So the triple bond becomes a single bond with two H's added. So R-C≡C-CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because that would require adding two H's to each carbon, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation of the triple bond would produce a trans double bond first, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond to form a single bond, but that's a bit of a misstep. Maybe I should think about another approach.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the triple bond needs to be converted into a carbonyl group.

Hmm, how do you convert a triple bond to a carbonyl? One method is through the use of a ketone or aldehyde via ozonolysis, but that would break the triple bond. Alternatively, using a mercury-based oxidation, like oxymercuration, or perhaps using a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, another thought: the triple bond can be converted to a ketone via the hydroxylation and oxidation. Or, perhaps via a hydration reaction. Wait, the hydration of an alkyne can give a ketone if the triple bond is internal, but for a terminal alkyne, it can give a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde.

Wait, wait a minute. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. If we can convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group, that would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO group). But how? Let's think about the steps.

If we have R-C≡CH, and we want R-CHO. One way is via oxidation. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne would give R-COOH, but maybe under certain conditions, it can give R-CHO.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the triple bond can be converted to a carbonyl via a two-step process. For example, using a strong base like NaNH2, followed by alkylation, then hydrogenation, and then oxidation.

Wait, but looking at the options, they involve a series of steps. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Reagents are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liquid NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, so the first step in all options is NaNH2 with some alkylating agent: either methyl chloride or ethyl chloride, or methanol.

So, step 1 in all options is deprotonating the terminal alkyne to form an acetylide and then alkylation. So the initial product after step 1 is R-C≡C-R', where R' is the alkyl group from the alkyl chloride.

So for option C, after step 1, the product is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Then step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So that would produce cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, but that doesn't lead to a carbonyl group. So perhaps that path isn't the right one. Because the target has a CHO group, which suggests we need to oxidize a CH2 group or something.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a diol, which can then be oxidized. Wait, but that would require ozonolysis followed by oxidation. Or perhaps Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach. The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is also attached to the main cyclohexane ring. Also, the main ring has a formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Alkyne to alkyne with substituent (using NaNH2 and alkyl chloride)
2. Hydrogenate to cis or trans double bond (but not sure)
3. Perform some dihydroxylation or epoxidation.
Wait, but that might not get us to the formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, which can then undergo further reactions.

Wait, the triple bond can be oxidized to a ketone. But how? Maybe through a two-step process: first, reduce the triple bond to a cis double bond, then oxidize the double bond to a ketone.

Wait, but another way: Using Ozone (O3) on alkyne? Ozonolysis is usually for alkenes. But for alkynes, ozonolysis gives different products. For a terminal alkyne, ozonolysis would typically produce a carboxylic acid or a ketone, depending on conditions.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me try to outline the possible steps for each option.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-CaCO3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

So, after step 1: cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: hydrogenation adds H2 across triple bond to make cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a propane chain attached to the cyclohexane. But the target requires a formyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe after hydrogenation, the next step is ozonolysis. But that would cleave the molecule. So if we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, ozonolysis would break the central CH2-CH2, but I don't see how that would give a formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is a different hydrogenation. Wait, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. Wait, but using H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

So, after step 2, we have a single bond. Then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone is for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But in this case, after step 2, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong path. Let me think about the target molecule again.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at position 1, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl.

Wait, that substituent would look like CH2-OH (hydroxymethyl) attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, it's a CH2 group connected to both OH and cyclohexyl.

So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, that's a branching point.

So, perhaps the substituent comes from a Grignard reaction or some alkylation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone. So, R-C≡CH → R-CO-R'. How?

Maybe via hydration. But under what conditions? For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O, which is a hydration of the alkyne to a ketone. Wait, but that's for internal alkynes, I think. Terminal alkynes can be hydrated to give ketones under certain conditions. Alternatively, a terminal alkyne could be converted to a carboxylic acid via strong oxidation.

Wait, the target has a formyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a formyl group.

Another thought: The triple bond can be converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. For example, using O3 followed by reductive work-up could give a carbonyl.

Wait, ozonolysis of an internal alkyne gives different products than an external alkyne. For a terminal alkyne, ozonolysis might give a carboxylic acid on one end and a ketone on the other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using O3 followed by (CH3)2S (which is a reductive work-up) would give different products. Ozone cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But triple bonds? I'm not as certain.

Alternatively, ozonolysis of alkynes can produce diketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step of each option.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, then react with methanol. Acetylide + methanol would give R-C≡C-CH2-OH? Or perhaps R-C≡C-OCH3? No, wait, methanol would act as an electrophile. The acetylide would attack methyl iodide, for example, but here it's methanol. Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, maybe the acetylide would react with methanol to form the alkyne with a methoxy group. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is alkylation with methanol, giving R-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2 is Li/liquid NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or deprotonation. Then ozonolysis and (CH3)2S, which is a reductive work-up, and then NH4OH.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves introducing a carbonyl group. Let's try to think of each step for the target.

The target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

So perhaps, the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can then be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for what each reagent does in the options.

Looking at Option C: After step 1 and 2, we have a single bond (propane chain), then ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of propane would do nothing because there's no double bond. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq NH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

So step 1: R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, perhaps dehydrohalogenation, but here we have an alkylated alkyne. Wait, but after alkylation, we have R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3, which is a powerful base, perhaps for deprotonating and eliminating. But where would the proton come from? The CH2CH3 group is a branch. Wait, maybe it's used to form an alkyne with a longer chain?

Alternatively, maybe the Li/NH3 is used for deprotonating the alkylated alkyne and forming a stronger base, but I'm not certain.

Then step 3 is O3/H2O, which is ozonolysis. So if the alkyne was converted into a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is to convert the alkyne into a diol, which can then be cleaved.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the target's structure. It has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So maybe the synthesis involves two substitutions or additions to the main ring.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a formyl group, which suggests an oxidation step. So perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to a carbonyl group. How?

One method is via acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkyne to a ketone or aldehyde. For terminal alkynes, under certain conditions, they can be hydrated to form aldehydes.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So, the starting alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) is treated with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (hydration catalyst) in H2O to form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (the formyl group). But looking at the options, some have this as step 3 or 4.

Looking at option A: step 3 is Ba(OH)2, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination.

So, let me think about option A:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation of triple bond to single bond: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't get us a carbonyl. So step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination. So, perhaps the R-CH2-CH2-CH3 could be deprotonated and eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, but R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is just a propane chain, which doesn't have acidic protons in the middle. Unless the hydrogenation leads to a diol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but that's more for double bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reagents again.

Option C: Steps include O3 and (CH3)2S. O3 is for ozonolysis, which breaks double bonds into carbonyls. So if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it. Then, (CH3)2S is a reductive work-up, which would prevent the formation of peroxides and form aldehydes/ketones.

So perhaps step 2 in option C is hydrogenation of the triple bond to a double bond. Wait, but H2/Pd typically fully hydrogenates a triple bond to a single bond. Alternatively, if the catalyst is poisoned, it might stop at the cis-alkene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe step 2 in option C is hydrogenation to a cis double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, starting with R-C≡C-CH3 (after step 1). Step 2: H2 and Pd-CaCO3. If the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, R-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not possible because hydrogenation of a triple bond to a double bond would give a cis or trans double bond, but in this case, the alkyne is R-C≡C-CH3, so hydrogenation would give R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. So maybe I'm wrong about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 is partial, giving a double bond. But I don't know the conditions for that.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the target again. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group on the main ring.

So, perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne via oxidation. And the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group comes from some alkylation or addition.

Wait, another approach: The substituent is CH2(OH)Cyclohexyl. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, then a Grignard reaction adds the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol or something that can undergo conjugate addition.

Wait, stepping back, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to form R-C≡C-CH3.

2. The triple bond is then hydrogenated to a single bond, giving R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Then, perhaps some dihydroxylation occurs, but I don't see where.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, directly giving the formyl group.

Wait, perhaps using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O (hydration) on the alkyne would give the formyl group. So, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So, perhaps after other steps, this would hydrate a triple bond to form an aldehyde.

But then, in option A, step 1 is alkylation, step 2 is hydrogenation, which would eliminate the triple bond, so step 4's reagents would have nothing to act upon.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first introduce the formyl group, then introduce the substituent.

Wait, but the target has both substituents on the same ring.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct option is C.

In option C, the steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond? But after step 2, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

Hmm, that can’t be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about step 2. Maybe the hydrogenation is done under conditions that stop at the cis-alkene. So, R-C≡C-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be full hydrogenation. Unless the catalyst is poisoned, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a Lindlar catalyst which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond.

Wait, that's a possibility. So, if the hydrogenation is done with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's (which is not one of the options), but in option C, the catalyst is Pd-CaCO3, which is usually for full hydrogenation. So maybe step 2 in option C doesn't form a double bond.

Wait, but without a double bond, ozonolysis in step 3 won't do anything. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Looking at option D: after step 1, we have R-C≡C-OCH3. Then step 2 is Li/NH3. Li in NH3 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. So, R-C≡C-OCH3 treated with Li/NH3 could deprotonate something. Or maybe it's used for forming a Grignard reagent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is elimination to form a longer alkyne or a diene. But I'm not certain.

Option B: steps include after alkylation, Li/NH3, which could induce elimination, perhaps forming a longer alkyne or alkene. Then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate it to a single bond, then perform an oxidation to form the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base that could perform elimination. But Ba(OH)2 is often used in the Birch reduction, but more commonly in epoxide ring opening.

Wait, perhaps in step 3 of option A, Ba(OH)2 is used as a base to deprotonate something, leading to an elimination, forming a double bond.

So, after step 2 in option A, the product is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which could deprotonate a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination and forming a double bond. So R-CH2-CH2-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but with Ba(OH)2, perhaps it's a base that abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of an alkene via elimination. So R-CH2-CH2-CH3 → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 can't eliminate because it's a single bond. So maybe that's not possible.

This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should think about the target structure again. The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is formed from oxidation of a primary alcohol, which comes from a propargyl alcohol. How?

Propargyl alcohol (R-CH2-C≡C-H) can be oxidized to R-CHO. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a two-step process: first, reduction to a cis-alkene, then oxidation to an aldehyde.

Wait, but I don't see the reagents for that in the options.

Another thought: Maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl via a hydrative cleavage. Using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O would convert a triple bond to a carbonyl. So, R-C≡C-R' → R-C=O + R'-COOH (for internal alkynes). But for a terminal alkyne, R-C≡CH → R-COOH or R-CHO?

Wait, for a terminal alkyne, acid-catalyzed hydration would produce R-CO-H (an aldehyde) only under specific conditions. Maybe using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O would do that.

So, if the alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH), treatment with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (R-CHO). Then, the substituent comes from another alkylation.

But looking at the options, some options have this as a later step, like option A's step 4.

So, in option A:

Step 1: Alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → ?

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → but after step 2, the triple bond is gone. So step 4 can't do anything. Therefore, option A may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first perform the alkylation, then hydrogenate to a cis-alkene, then perform ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

Wait, another option: Maybe the alkyne is first alkylated and then hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, which is then ozonolyzed to form two carbonyl groups.

So for option C:

After step 1: R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3. If it stops at the cis-alkene (but I don't think so, as Pd-CaCO3 is usually for full hydrogenation), but assuming it does, you get R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, ozonolysis won't do anything. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: R-C≡C-CH3-OCH3? Not sure. Wait, NaNH2 and methanol would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide, which would react with methanol. Methanol would act as an electrophile, so the acetylide would attack it. So R-C≡C-CH2-OCH3? Or maybe R-C≡C-OCH3? I'm not certain.

Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base, perhaps for elimination. So maybe the R-C≡C-OCH3 would eliminate to form a longer alkyne or alkene. Not sure.

Then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would break double bonds into carbonyls. But if step 2 didn't form a double bond, this step wouldn't do anything.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe after step 1, the product is R-C≡C-Me (methyl). Then, step 2, using Li/NH3, could deprotonate and eliminate to form a longer alkyne.

Wait, but R-C≡C-CH3 is ethylcyclohexane with a propynyl group attached. Maybe step 2 would deprotonate and form a lithium acetylide, then eliminate to form a longer alkyne. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is quite challenging. Let me think about the correct reagent sequence.

The target has a formyl group and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne via oxidation, and the substituent comes from another alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated (step 1 in all options).

2. The alkyne is then converted into a carbonyl group (formyl) via hydration.

3. Then, some reaction to introduce the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

But in the options, the reagents don't directly show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is done first, then the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, then some dihydroxylation happens, leading to a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible functional groups in the target. The target has a CHO group and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

The alkyne can be converted into a carbonyl group via some oxidation. So, perhaps the correct reagents are those that allow for that.

Looking back at the options, option C includes O3 and (CH3)2S as reagents. Ozonolysis is typically used on double bonds, but for alkyne ozonolysis, it tends to break the triple bond into two carbonyls.

So, if the alkyne is first hydrogenated into a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But the target molecule has only one carbonyl (the formyl group), so perhaps this path isn't correct.

Wait, but if the alkyne is first alkylated (step 1: R-C≡C-CH3), then hydrogenated into a cis double bond (step 2: R-CH2-CH2-CH3 → No, that's a single bond, not a double bond), then ozonolysis wouldn't help. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The target has a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl. So, perhaps that substituent comes from a Grignard reaction.

So, after forming a carbonyl (CHO), perhaps a Grignard reagent would add to it. But how?

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option D: Steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/liq NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a longer alkyne or alkene.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → work-up.

But I'm not sure.

Option B: Steps include O3 and H2O, then NH4OH. Ozone in H2O with H2O would perhaps cleave the alkyne into two carbonyls. But the target has only one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Wait, let me think of another approach: The target has a substituent (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) and a formyl group. So perhaps the formyl group is from the alkyne, and the substituent is from an addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a ketone, which then undergoes some addition, like a Grignard reaction.

But without a clear path, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reagents and their purposes:

NaNH2 is a strong base, used to deprotonate terminal alkynes to form acetylides.

Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent, so the acetylide would attack it, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

H2/Pd is for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination or as a base in various reactions.

H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O are for the hydration of alkynes to ketones or aldehydes.

O3 is for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. (CH3)2S is a reductive work-up.

Li/NH3 is a strong base, used in eliminations or reductions.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne → acetylide → alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis but without a double bond, nothing happens. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is not ozonolysis but something else.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: To form the hydroxymethyl group, perhaps a hydroboration-oxidation reaction is needed, but that's not present in the options.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent comes from a Grignard reaction after the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl.

So, step 1: Alkyne is alkylated to R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Triple bond is hydrogenated to single bond → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that doesn't form a carbonyl, which is needed for the formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first form the formyl group, then add the substituent. How?

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO group) via hydration.

2. Then, introduce the substituent.

But how?

In that case, the first step would be hydration with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. So looking for an option that starts with that.

Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is that. So, steps 1-3 must set up for step 4.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the reagents.

The target requires a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group.

Looking at the options, the only ones that include H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O (which can form the CHO) are options A and C. But option C's step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which I don't see as forming a CHO.

Wait, option C's last step is Ba(OH)2, which is a base. That might not form a carbonyl.

Option A's step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which would form the CHO.

But how does the substituent form?

So, in option A:

Step 1: Alkyne → R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenate → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a double bond. But Ba(OH)2 might not do that. Alternatively, maybe it's used to form an epoxide, but that's unclear.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → which would add a carbonyl, but the triple bond is already gone.

Hmm, I'm stuck.

Perhaps the correct option is C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because it includes O3 and (CH3)2S, which are for ozonolysis, which can form carbonyl groups.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis won't do anything.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because after hydrogenation, the molecule has a single bond, and then some other steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C: after alkylating the alkyne and hydrogenating, then performing ozonolysis on a double bond that's formed elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate to a cis-alkene, then perform ozonolysis to generate two carbonyls. But for the target, only one carbonyl is needed (the formyl group), so perhaps the other part is a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent comes from an epoxide opening.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent. The analysis of the options involves evaluating the reagents and their sequences to determine which pathway leads to the desired product.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃.
   - **Step 2**: H₂/Pd fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
   - **Step 3**: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly used for elimination, but it is unclear how this step contributes to forming the formyl group or the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl substituent.
   - **Step 4**: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, and H₂O are used for hydration, but the triple bond is already consumed in Step 2, making this step ineffective for forming the CHO group.
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:
   - **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
   - **Step 2**: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
   - **Step 3**: O₃/H₂O performs ozonolysis, which typically cleaves double bonds. However, there is no double bond present after Step 2, making this step ineffective.
   - **Step 4**: NH₄OH is a mild reducing agent, but its role is unclear in this context.
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

3. **Option C**:
   - **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃.
   - **Step 2**: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
   - **Step 3**: O₃/(CH₃)₂S is used for ozonolysis. However, ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after Step 2, making this step ineffective.
   - **Step 4**: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - **Step 1**: NaNH₂ and methanol alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₂-OCH₃.
   - **Step 2**: Li/liq. NH₃ is a strong base, possibly used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
   - **Step 3**: O₃/(CH₃)₂S is used for ozonolysis. However, ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after Step 2, making this step ineffective.
   - **Step 4**: NH₄OH is a mild reducing agent, but its role is unclear in this context.
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

### Final Conclusion:
None of the options provide a clear and logical sequence of reagents to synthesize the target molecule. However, based on the analysis, **Option C** is the most plausible, as it includes reagents that could potentially form the hydroxymethyl-cyclohexyl group and the formyl group, despite the unclear intermediate steps.
