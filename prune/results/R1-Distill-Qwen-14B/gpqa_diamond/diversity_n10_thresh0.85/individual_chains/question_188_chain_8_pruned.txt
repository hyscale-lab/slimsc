Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that for crystals, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane. The general formula I think is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something about the angles maybe?), but wait, I'm not sure. Oh right, for cubic systems, it's simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But this is a rhombohedral crystal, which means all edges are equal (a = b = c), but the angles are not 90 degrees. So the formula must be more complicated.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1/(a²)) + ... something about the angles between the axes).

Oh wait, maybe it's better to use the formula involving the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, I remember the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Since all edges are a and the angles are all equal (alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees), the formula might be different.

Let me try to recall. The general formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) + 2(hl cos β)/(a²) + 2(kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, so α = β = gamma = 30 degrees. So maybe that simplifies things.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been skewed. So perhaps the formula for d can be adjusted using the angles.

Alternatively, the formula I think is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

But wait, for a rhombohedral system, because a = b = c and all angles are equal, so cos α, cos beta, cos gamma are all the same. So this simplifies the equation.

Wait, no, wait: in the general formula for interplanar distance, the denominator is:

( h² + k² + l² ) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α )

But in rhombohedral, alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So, let's plug in the values.

So, hkl is 111. So h=1, k=1, l=1.

Let me compute the denominator term:

Denominator term = (1² + 1² +1²) + 2*(1*1 * cos30) + 2*(1*1 * cos30) + 2*(1*1 * cos30).

Wait, wait, each of those terms? Let me think again. The term is (h² +k² + l²) plus 2 hk cos gamma (which is 30 degrees here), plus 2 hl cos beta (30), and 2 kl cos alpha (30). So for 111, each of the products hk, hl, kl is 1, so each of those 2 terms would be 2 * 1 * cos30.

So the denominator term is 3 (from 1+1+1) plus 2*(cos30)*3, because there are three terms each contributing 2*cos30. Let me compute that.

Wait, denominator = 3 + 2*(cos30)*3 ?

Wait, no. Wait, the terms are 2*(hk cos gamma) + 2*(hl cos beta) + 2*(kl cos alpha). Since all angles are 30, each term is 2*(1*1 * cos30). There are three such terms: hk, hl, kl.

So 2*(1)(1) cos30 * 3 (since each of hk, hl, kl is 1, and multiplied by 2 and cos30).

So denominator = 3 + 3*(2 * cos30) ?

Wait, let me compute. 3 terms each with 2*cos30. So 3 * (2 cos30) )=6 cos30.

So denominator = 3 + 6 cos30.

Now, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

So denominator = 3 +5.196 = 8.196.

So d = a /
