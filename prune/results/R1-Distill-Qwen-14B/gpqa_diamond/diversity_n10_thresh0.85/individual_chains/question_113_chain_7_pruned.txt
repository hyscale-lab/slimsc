Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here. It's about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopic techniques. Hmm, I need to think this through step by step.

The question says that the compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Oh, wait, I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H peak, right? Or maybe it's an alcohol. But I also have other peaks at 1700 and 1650. Oh, those are important. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which probably indicates a carbonyl group. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated or something else. Wait, 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C stretch or maybe an amide. But more likely, if both are carbonyls, maybe it's something with two carbonyl groups or maybe a conjugated system.

Looking at the NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they are attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or aromatic ring. So the compound probably has a double bond or aromatic protons.

The mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Common fragments with m/z 45 could be from CH3CO+ (like acetate) which is 45. Or maybe it's from something else, but acetate is a common one.

Now, let's look at the possible formulas:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, the molecular formulas are either with two oxygen atoms or one. Let's think about each.

First, the IR. Broad peak at 3000 likely O-H. 1700 is a carbonyl. So maybe ester or ketone? Wait, but if there are two carbonyl peaks, that would imply two different carbonyl groups. For example, an ester has a carbonyl, maybe another one from something else. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in an aromatic ring with a ketone. Wait, but the 1650 is a bit lower than 1700, which might indicate a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ester or something like that.

Now, the FTIR has a broad peak, which suggests maybe a hydrogen-bonded O-H, so maybe an acid or an alcohol. But if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol during the ester's formation, but the ester itself wouldn't have an O-H. Wait, no, esters don't have O-H groups, unless it's an acid or an alcohol. Wait, maybe the compound is a diol or something else. Hmm, perhaps a carboxylic acid? But then the 1700 would be the O-H stretch? No, wait: carboxy
