Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, right? Let me see, I need to figure out the luminosity factor between two stars. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh wait, and the mass is also 1.5 times more. Interesting. The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength for blackbody radiation, right? So they have the same temperature because the peak wavelength according to Wien's law is inversely proportional to temperature. So T = constant / lambda_max. If the lambda_max is the same for both, their temperatures must be the same.

Wait, but what about the radial velocities? The velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. So Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, which would shift its peak emission. But wait, the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So I think I need to account for the Doppler effect here.

Let me think: the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_radial / c), where v is positive if moving away. But wait, for a star moving towards us, v would be negative, right? So Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 is stationary relative to us, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s away or towards?

Wait, the question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 is at rest, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So the rest frame peak for Star_2 must be different due to its motion, but when we observe it, the peak matches that of Star_1.

Wait, so each star emits at a certain wavelength based on their temperature. But due to Doppler effect, the observed wavelength is shifted. But the problem says the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both. So, let me model this.

Letâ€™s denote:

T1 = effective temperature of Star_1 (rest frame)
T2 = effective temperature of Star_2 (rest frame)
v1 = radial velocity of Star_1 = 0 km/s
v2 = radial velocity of Star_2 = 700 km/s

The observed wavelength for Star_1 is lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest = (constant / T1), because v1 is zero.

The observed wavelength for Star_2 is lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c). Because when the star is moving away, the wavelength increases. But according to the problem, lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda is proportional to 1/T, so lambda1_rest = constant / T1
lambda2_rest = constant / T2

So substituting:

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, but wait. Let me get this right. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity. So for Star_2, which is moving away, v would be positive. So if v2 is 700 km/s, then lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + 700/c). But if Star_2 is moving towards us, v would be negative. But the problem doesn't specify direction, just the magnitude. Hmm, but let me proceed.

Wait, but the observed wavelengths are the same, so lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs. But since Star_1's v is zero, lambda1_obs = lambda1_rest. So:

lambda1_rest = lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c)

But lambda2_rest is the rest wavelength, so substituting,

lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * (1 + v2
