Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which planet is more likely to transit, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's start by recalling what transit probability depends on.

Transit probability, right, the chance that a planet's orbit will line up with our line of sight so we can see it pass in front of its star. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But wait, the question says both planets have circular orbits, and we're using the RV method, which tells us their minimum masses and periods. So maybe the RV method gives some clues about the inclination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on the sine of the inclination. So if the RV method found both, their masses are the same, but their periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is orbiting closer to its star.

The host stars' info: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting. So the more massive star (Planet_1's host) isn't larger in radius, which I guess relates to it being more evolved? Wait, no, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. More evolved stars might expand, but they have the same radius here, so perhaps they are main-sequence stars but Planet_2's host is a bit older or something.

But how does the star's mass and radius affect transit probability? The transit probability formula, if I remember, is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (something about the orbital distance and alignment).

Wait, no, I think the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the likelihood that the orbital plane is edge-on enough for a transit. The formula for the probability of a transit is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's the duration or something else. Oh wait, the probability is actually about the alignment. The probability P is roughly (R*/a) * (something else?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R*/a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R*)) ), but since planets are much smaller than stars, R_p is negligible. So it's roughly (R*/a). So P ≈ (R*/a) * (something else, maybe).

Wait, no, the formula I think is P ≈ (R*/a) * (some function of inclination), but for random inclinations, the average is 1/(2) * (R*/a) * (sin something?), but perhaps the average probability is (R*/a) * (1/(2)). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability for a planet is the chance that its orbital plane is edge-on enough relative to our line of sight. It's often given by (R* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's approximated as (2 R*) / a. Wait, no, I'm not sure about the 2. Alternatively, another source I've read says the probability is (R*/a) times (something else). Hmm.

Wait, I found a formula before: P = (R*/a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1. So P = R*/a.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a is larger, the probability is smaller. So for a planet with a larger semi-major axis, the transit probability is lower. So the question is, what are the semi-major axes of these two planets?

Wait, the orbital period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. Since the host stars have different masses, their semi-major axes will be different.

So let's compute a for each planet. Using Kepler's third law in the form a³ = (G(M + m) P²)/(4π²). Since the planets' masses are much smaller than their stars, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So a³ ∝ M * P².

For Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2 (since Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's). P1 = P2 / 3.

So a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 = 2 M2 * P2² /9.

For Planet_2: a2^3 = M2 * P2².

So the ratio a1/a2 = ( (2 M2 * (P2²/9)) / ( M2 * P2²) )^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222, cube root of that is about 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, let me compute that cube root exactly. 2/9 = (2)/(3^2) = 2/(9). The cube root is (2)^(1/3) / (3)^(2/3). Let me compute that numerically.

Cube root of 2 is approx 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 is approximately 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period and the star is more massive, so the planet is closer in.

Now, transit probability is P = (R*/a) * (1/(2)), no? Wait, I think the formula is P = (R*/a) * ( (1 + (R_p/R*)) ), but R_p is negligible, so P ≈ (R*) / a.

Wait, I'm pretty sure the correct formula for the probability is (R* + R_p) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5 ), but with e=0, it's (R* + R_p) / a. But since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's approximately R* / a.

But wait, some sources say the probability is (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (a/(R*)))) or something else. Hmm, maybe I should look for a more precise formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R*/a) * (1 / (1 - (b)^2)), where b is the impact parameter, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance at which the planet can transit. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think again. The transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where the line of sight intersects the star. For a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is (R*/a) divided by (something). Wait, no, another approach: the area of the star's disk is π R*². The area where the planet could block the star is a circle of radius a around the star. So the probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the circle where the planet can transit. So P = (π R*²) / (π a²) ) = (R*/a)^2. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when a is much bigger than R*, the probability should be lower, but this formula suggests it's (R*/a)^2, which is even lower.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. So the area of the star is π R*², and the area of the planet's orbit is π a². The probability that the planet's path crosses the star's disk is the ratio (π R*²) / (π a²) ) = (R*/a)^2. Wait, but that would imply that the probability is (R*/a)^2, but according to what I remember, it's (R*/a) multiplied by another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the solid angle subtended by the star at the planet's location. The solid angle is (π R*² ) / a². The total solid angle around the planet is 4π steradians. So the probability would be (π R*² / a²) ) / (4π) ) = R*²/(4 a²). So P = (R* / (2 a))². Wait, but that gives (R*/(2a)) squared, which would be (R*/(2a))². So P = (R* / (2 a ))^2. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The transit occurs when the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the distance of the planet from the star, but that's in terms of angular size. Hmm, I think the correct formula is P = (R* + R_p) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. So for P, it's roughly R*/a because R_p is much smaller.

So given that, the transit probability is proportional to R*/a.

In the problem, both stars have the same radius R*. So R* for Planet_1 and Planet_2 is the same. So P1/P2 = (R* / a1) / (R* / a2 ) = a2 / a1.

From earlier, I found a1 ≈ 0.606 a2. So a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R* / a1) = (R* / (0.606 a2 )) = (1 / 0.606) * (R*/a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R*/a2). Since Planet_2's probability is (R* / a2 ), Planet_1's probability is approx 1.65 times Planet_2's.

Wait, wait! Wait, no. Because the transit probability is R*/a. So if a1 is smaller than a2, then P1 is larger than P2. Because R* is the same. So the ratio P1/P2 is a2 / a1 = 1.65. So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability to transit than Planet_2.

But wait, the question says the researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability. So if Planet_1 has higher probability (approx 1.65 times higher), they would choose to observe Planet_1.

Looking back at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let's compute a1 and a2 more accurately.

We have:

a^3 = (G (M + m) P^2 )/(4 π² )

Assuming m << M, so M+ m ≈ M.

a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

So the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2) (P2^2 / 9) ) ] / [ M2 P2^2 ) ] = (2 /9) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So transit probability is R*/a. Since R* is same for both, P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2.

So P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2 ) = a2 / a1 = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So yes, Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher transit probability. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_*}{a}
\]

where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Kepler's Third Law
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1:
- Orbital period: \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)
- Host star mass: \( M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2} \)

For Planet_2:
- Orbital period: \( P_2 \)
- Host star mass: \( M_{*,2} \)

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{*,1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars, the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606 \cdot a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
