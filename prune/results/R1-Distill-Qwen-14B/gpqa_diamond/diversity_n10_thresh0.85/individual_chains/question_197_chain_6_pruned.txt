Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for some kind of substitution reaction. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! When you have a nitrile and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's the Stephen reduction, which converts the nitrile to an aldehyde. Or wait, maybe it's different conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, another possibility: when an alkyne is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it gets converted into an alkane. Oh yes, that's right! The reaction is called the hydrohalogenation of alkynes. So if the starting material is an alkyne, it would add HI across the triple bond, turning it into an alkane. 

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "reacts with red phosphorus and HI", so it's likely the alkyne being converted to an alkane. So I need to figure out what the starting compound is, and then see what product would form after this reaction.

So, first step is to analyze the spectral data given for compound X.

The IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of an -OH group or an alkyne (since alkynes have stretching around 3300 cm-1, but maybe that's a different region). Wait, but another possibility is an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably an ester or a ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid (though their carbonyls are a bit lower, like 1700 cm-1). The 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs.

The 1H NMR data: Let's look at the peaks. 

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a broad singlet. Broad usually indicates exchange, like an -OH proton. But wait, in the presence of D2O, the OH peak would disappear, but sometimes it remains. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but they are usually around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, 10.5 is a bit higher and if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an -OH. But wait, if it's a carbonyl, like an acid, the OH is broad. So maybe the compound is a phenolic acid or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the other signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – that looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of two protons each. So maybe a para-disubstituted benzene, like p-xylene or something with substituents in the para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – this is a multiplet, maybe a CH next to something. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – another multiplet, perhaps two adjacent CH2 groups. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a triplet of three hydrogens, maybe a CH(CH3) group. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl or propyl chain.

Putting some of this together: the aromatic ring has substituents in para positions. So perhaps one substituent is a group attached to the ring, and another substituent is a side chain.

Wait, the NMR signals: the 10.5 ppm peak could be an acidic proton. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the IR shows 1720, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but that might not fit with the 10.5 peak. Or maybe it's a ketone? No, because ketones don't have protons that would show up at 10.5 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the aldehyde proton is usually a singlet, which this is. But the problem is the IR: an aldehyde's carbonyl is around 2800 (stretch for the aldehyde C-H) and 1720 for the carbonyl. Wait, the IR does have 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak. So maybe it's an ester or an aldehyde.

But if it's an aldehyde, then the aldehyde proton would be at around 9-10 ppm. So the 10.5 could be possible. But wait, the IR also has a peak at 3400–2500, which is a broad range. That could be from an O-H stretch (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid), or maybe an alkyne's C-H stretch. But the alkyne C-H is usually around 3300 cm-1, as a sharp peak, possibly a pair. But the IR here shows a broad range in that area, which might suggest O-H.

Wait, but let's think about the integration. The 10.5 peak is 1H. So, maybe it's an -OH. But if it's a carboxylic acid, then the OH is broad, which fits. The carbonyl would be around 1700, but the IR says 1720. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde. But then, the structure would be something like benzaldehyde. But looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which would be consistent with an aldehyde group in the para position. Wait, but I thought the 10.5 was the aldehyde proton.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester. Let me think: esters have a carbonyl around 1740-1720 cm-1 (so 1720 fits). But then, what about the 10.5 peak? That would not fit with an ester. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is an acidic proton from a carboxylic acid. So, if the molecule is a benzoic acid derivative, then the IR would have a strong peak around 1700, but here it's 1720, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but then where's the carbonyl in the NMR? Wait, the NMR doesn't show a carbonyl peak because it's in the carbon region, not hydrogen.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The IR has peaks at 3400–2500, which is a broad range. If that's an O-H stretch, then the compound has an -OH group. The 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or a ketone. The 1610 and 14
