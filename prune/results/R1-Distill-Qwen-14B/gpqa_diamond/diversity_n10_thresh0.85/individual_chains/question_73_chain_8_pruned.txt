Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are given, so I need to calculate both the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if you're on a train moving at 0.6c and you throw a ball forward at 0.5c relative to you, the ball's speed relative to the ground isn't 1.1c. Because of the relativity of velocity addition.

So the first part is finding the relative speed between the two astronauts. Let me recall the formula for relativistic velocity addition. Oh right, it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, wait. Because the frame here is moving with one astronaut, so the other's speed is calculated in that frame. Let me clarify: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So in A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, both are moving in the same direction, right? So from A's perspective, B is moving at a speed relative to A. So I should use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The formula for the relative speed u' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the original frame (the moving observer). Or maybe I have that backward. Let me think: if the original frame is S, and S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then in S', the velocity of an object moving at u in S is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

In this problem, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. Astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, B's velocity is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates B is moving slower than A, so the relative speed is 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that narrows it down to C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy of each astronaut is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c^2. Wait, but wait: the energies are from the lab frame, right? The problem doesn't specify
