Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star relative to the background as the Earth orbits the Sun, right? So the parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Like, closer stars have larger parallaxes. Oh yeah, because plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1 / distance (parsecs). So as distance increases, plx decreases.

The question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—does that mean uniform in terms of distance? Or uniform in some other way? Wait, uniform distribution in space would imply that the number density (number per volume) is constant. So if I imagine the universe as filled with stars with a uniform density, then the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's about how many stars you'd count in a range of plx values. Let's say plx ranges from plx to plx + dplx. How does the count depend on plx?

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Distance d is 1/plx. So if plx increases, distance decreases. So for a given volume, the number of stars depends on how many stars are in that volume. But how does the volume depend on plx?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with some math. Let's say we have a uniform number density n of stars per cubic parsec. So n is a constant.

We want to find the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd. The volume of the shell would be approximately the surface area of a sphere with radius d, multiplied by the thickness dd. So volume V = 4πd² dd.

The number of stars in that shell would be n * V = n * 4π d² dd.

But we want to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by d d = -(1/(plx^2)) dplx. Hmm, but for small changes, the negative sign would just affect the direction, but since we're considering the magnitude, perhaps I can just take the absolute value.

So substituting d = 1/plx into the number of stars:

Number of stars = n * 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * (dd) )

But wait, dd is in terms of distance. Let me express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = -d (d plx) / (plx^2). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me approach this more methodically. Let's express the number of stars as a function of parallax. Let me let plx = p.

Number of stars between p and p + dp.

The distance d is 1/p. So the volume between d and d + dd is 4π (d²) dd. But dd is in terms of dp.

Wait, since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. The negative indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But for the purpose of counting, we can consider the magnitude, so I'll use the absolute value.

So the volume element in terms of p is:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) )? Wait wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp → |dd| = (1/p²) dp. So substituting into dV:

dV = 4π (d^2) |dd| = 4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * (1/p²) dp ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that gives dV = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars is n * dV = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit range of p (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for a small change in plx (dp), the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm not sure if I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Because when you look at a certain range of parallax, say from p to p+dp, the corresponding distance is from d = 1/p to d=1/(p+dp). But perhaps I should think about the volume in terms of distance and then convert it into parallax.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp is the number density multiplied by the volume of the shell at parallax p with thickness dp.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the differential number of stars dN as a function of parallax p.

dN = n * dV.

But dV is the volume element in terms of p. Since d = 1/p, I can compute the volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume is 4π d^2 dd. But dd = - (1/p^2) dp. So substituting:

dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) dp ) → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So dN = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Hmm, so the number decreases as 1/p^4, which is option A.

Wait, but that seems a bit steep. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Imagine that in a certain range of parallax, the volume available for stars increases or decreases with p.

Wait, since p is inversely proportional to distance, a small range in p (like dp) corresponds to a shell at a certain distance. The volume of that shell is 4π d² dd, which as d=1/p, becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So yeah, that seems correct. So the count of stars in a given dp interval at a given p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the transformation. Let me recheck the substitution.

d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp → |dd| = (1/p²) dp.

So dV = 4π d² |dd| → 4π (1/p²) (1/p²) dp → 4π/p^4 dp.

So yes, dN = n * 4π/p^4 dp → so the number per unit p (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). Assuming a uniform number density \( n \) of stars per cubic parsec, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:

\[
dN = n \cdot dV,
\]

where \( dV \) is the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is:

\[
dV = 4\pi d^2 \, dd.
\]

Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (taking the absolute value for the magnitude), we find:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \, dp = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( 1/p^4 \)**.
