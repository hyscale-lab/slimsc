Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with stability constants and complex ion equilibria. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations given are [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16 respectively.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. I'm a bit confused about the numbering of the stability constants. Stability constants usually denote the formation of complexes stepwise. So β1 is the constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on. For Co(II) complexes with SCN-, I think the complexes would form as:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)^(n+) with each step adding more SCN^-.

Wait, let me think. For Co(II), the common complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, etc. Or maybe I should look at the possible complexes based on the stability constants.

Wait, the given β's are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's four different β's. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each step would add another SCN^- ion. So maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)^(n+), n=1,2,3,4.

Wait, but the problem refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN^- ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, perhaps? Or maybe another structure. Hmm.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the key is to find the fraction of each possible complex and then sum those that are dithiocyanato.

Let me think about the general approach. The problem involves multiple complexation steps. The stability constant (β) for each step is given, so the overall stability constant for the nth complex would be the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, wait. The stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, would have β_total=β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360. The third complex would have β_total=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=25200. The fourth complex would have β1*β2*β3*β4=25200*16=403200. Wait, but wait a minute, the β4 is 16. That's really high. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct, or if the β4 refers to a different step. Wait, maybe the β4 is for a different kind of complex, perhaps a different charge. Alternatively, perhaps I've got the order wrong. Wait, another thought. Maybe the β's are for the formation of each successive complex, so β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, etc. So, the overall β for the first complex is β1, second is β1β2, third β1β2β3, fourth β1β2β3β4.

But wait, wait a second. The problem says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So, I think each β represents the stepwise formation of the next complex. So, for each additional SCN^- added, the β is multiplied. So, the first complex has β1=9, the second β1β2=9*40=360, the third β1β2β3=9*40*63=25200, and the fourth β1β2β3β4=25200*16=403200.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit large. Normally, stability constants don't get that high, but maybe it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the way the stability constants are applied. Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is the fourth step, but I'm not sure if the complexes are forming in that way. Hmm.

But let's proceed. The general approach is to model the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

The problem is about finding the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN^- ligands. So, that would include the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, but wait, I need to confirm.

Wait, the complexes are Co(II) with SCN. So, for each complex, the charge would decrease by one each time we add an SCN^- because SCN^- is a -1 charge. Let's think:

Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1)
[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (charge 0)
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^- (charge -1)
[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (charge -2)
Wait, that's four complexes, each with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN ligands. So the dithiocyanato complex would be the second one, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So, the question is, what's the fraction of Co in this species among all Co species.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth β is for a different type of complex, but that's unclear.

Anyway, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex in the solution, sum the fractions for the dithiocyanato species, and then find the percentage.

The way to model this is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants and the concentrations.

The general formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [Co] [SCN]^n) / (sum over all species of their respective terms)

Wait, more accurately, the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [Co] [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^m β1 β2 ... βk [Co] [SCN]^k )

But wait, wait, actually, the initial species is Co^2+ which can be considered as the zeroth complex, so m would be 4 (since four β's are given).

Wait, perhaps. Let me think. The species present are:

- Co^2+ : k=0
- Co(SCN)^+ : k=1
- Co(SCN)_2^0 : k=2
- Co(SCN)_3^- : k=3
- Co(SCN)_4^{2-} : k=4

Each species has a certain concentration, which depends on the stepwise formation constants. The fraction of each species is given by the product of the β's up to that point, multiplied by [SCN^-]^k, divided by the sum over all possible k of similar terms.

So, the fraction for each species is:

f_k = (β_1 β_2 ... β_k [Co] [SCN]^k ) / D,

where D is the denominator, the sum from k=0 to 4 of (β_1 β_2 ... β_k [Co] [SCN]^k )

Wait, but wait, for k=0, the product up to β_0 (but β_0 is 1, as the formation constant for the zeroth step is 1). So for k=0, it's just [Co], and for k=1, it's β1 [Co][SCN]^1, etc.

So, to compute f_2 (for the dithiocyanato complex), I need to compute the numerator for k=2, which is β1 β2 [Co][SCN]^2, and then divide by the sum of all terms for k=0 to 4.

But wait, wait, no. The denominator D is:

D = [Co] ( [SCN]^0 β_0 + [SCN]^1 β_1 + [SCN]^2 β_1 β_2 + [SCN]^3 β_1 β_2 β_3 + [SCN]^4 β_1 β_2 β_3 β_4 )

Because each term is the product of β's up to that step multiplied by [SCN]^k, times [Co], but [Co] is common to all, so it can be factored out when calculating the fractions.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write the denominator as:

D = [Co] (1 * [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Because for each k, the term is (product of β's up to k) multiplied by [SCN]^k.

So, for each species k, the term is:

term_k = product_{i=1}^k β_i * [SCN]^k

So, for each k, term_0 = 1 (since no β's, product is 1), term_1=β1 [S], term_2=β1 β2 [S]^2, etc.

Therefore, the fraction f_k = term_k / sum(term_0 to term_4)

So, in the problem, I need to compute the sum of all term_k from k=0 to 4, then find the fraction for k=2, multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

So, let's compute each term:

Given:

β1 = 9
β2 = 40
β3 = 63
β4 = 16

[Co] = 1e-2 M (but it's a common factor in all terms, so cancels out when taking fractions)
[SCN^-] = 0.1 M

Compute each term:

term_0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1 * 1 = 1
term_1 = β1 * (0.1)^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
term_2 = β1 * β2 * (0.1)^2 = 9 *40 * 0.01 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6
term_3 = β1 * β2 * β3 * (0.1)^3 = 9*40*63 * 0.001 = 25200 * 0.001 = 25.2
term_4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * (0.1)^4 = 9*40*63*16 * 0.0001
Let me compute that step by step.

Compute 9 *40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16=362880.

Now, (0.1)^4 = 0.0001.

So term_4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So the terms are:

term_0: 1
term_1: 0.9
term_2: 3.6
term_3: 25.2
term_4: 36.288

Now sum all terms: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 +3.6=5.5; 5.5 +25.2=30.7; 30.7+36.288=66.988.

So D = sum =66.988.

Wait, wait, but wait, the denominator is [Co] multiplied by D, but since [Co] is the same for all terms, it cancels when computing the fractions. So, the fraction for each term is term_k / sum.

So, the fraction for term_2 (k=2) is 3.6 / 66.988 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

3.6 / 66.988 ≈ 0.0537 or 5.37%.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are 16.9%, etc.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of the terms? Let me double-check.

Wait, let me recompute each term.

term_0: 1.

term_1: β1 * [S] =9 * 0.1 =0.9.

term_2: β1 β2 [S]^2. So 9 *40=360. 360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

term_3: β1 β2 β3 [S]^3. 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680. 22680 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 *0.001=22.68. Wait, wait, earlier I said 25.2. Oh, no, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute that again.

Hmm, 9 *40=360. 360*63= 360 *60=21600, 360 *3=1080 → 21600+1080=22680.

22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

Wait, earlier I wrote 25.2. That was incorrect. So term_3 should be 22.68.

term_4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4.

Compute β1*β2*β3*β4:

9 *40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

Now, [S]^4 is (0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So, terms are:

term_0=1

term_1=0.9

term_2=3.6

term_3=22.68

term_4=36.288

Now, sum all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9.

+3.6 → 5.5.

+22.68 → 28.18.

+36.288 → 64.468.

So sum D=64.468.

Hmm, that's different from my previous calculation.

So, each term is:

term_0:1

term_1:0.9 → 0.9

term_2:3.6 →3.6

term_3:22.68 →22.68

term_4:36.288 →36.288

Sum:1+0.9=1.9; +3.6→5.5; +22.68→28.18; +36.288→64.468.

So, the fraction f_2 is 3.6 / 64.468.

Compute 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557 → 5.557%.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the β's. Wait, maybe the β4 is for a different step, like the formation of the third complex. Because my earlier calculation gave term_3 as 22.68, but perhaps that's because I misapplied the β's.

Wait, no. The way the β's are applied is stepwise. So, the first step is β1=9, second β2=40, third β3=63, and fourth β4=16. So, term_4 is β1*β2*β3*β4*(S)^4.

Wait, but perhaps the β4 is for the third complex, not the fourth. Because the number of β's corresponds to the number of complexes beyond the first.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are such that for each complex, the overall formation constant is the product up to that point. So, for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β_total=β1*β2=9*40=360.

The third complex, [Co(SCN)_3]^-: β_total=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=25200.

The fourth complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}: β_total=β1*β2*β3*β4=25200 *16=403200.

But when calculating the terms, each term is [Co] multiplied by β1*β2...βk multiplied by [SCN]^k, but [Co] is present once, and each step adds another SCN.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the term for the k-th complex is:

term_k = (β1 β2 ... βk) * [Co] * [SCN]^k.

So, for k=0: term_0 = [Co] * 1 * [SCN]^0 = [Co] *1 *1 = [Co].

For k=1: β1 [Co] [SCN]^1.

k=2: β1β2 [Co][SCN]^2.

k=3: β1β2β3 [Co][SCN]^3.

k=4: β1β2β3β4 [Co][SCN]^4.

So, when summing all terms, the sum D is [Co] * (1 + β1 [S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + β1β2β3 [S]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [S]^4 )

So, in this case, [Co] is 1e-2 M, [S]=0.1 M.

But wait, in the denominator, [Co] is a common factor, so when calculating f_k, which is (β1..βk [S]^k) / sum(...), the [Co] cancels out.

So, the denominator is sum = 1 + β1 [S] + β1β2 [S]^2 + β1β2β3 [S]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [S]^4.

Let me compute each part:

Compute each term:

Term_0: 1
Term_1: β1 [S] =9 * 0.1 =0.9
Term_2: β1β2 [S]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6
Term_3: β1β2β3 [S]^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3= 25200 * 0.001=25.2
Term_4: β1β2β3β4 [S]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4= 403200 * 0.0001=40.32

So, the terms are:

1, 0.9, 3.6, 25.2,40.32.

Sum D = 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6→5.5; +25.2→30.7; +40.32→71.02.

So sum D=71.02.

Now, the fraction for term_2 is term_2 / D =3.6 /71.02 ≈0.0507 ≈5.07%.

Hmm, that's about 5%, which isn't matching any of the options. The options are 42%, 25%, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of term_4 or term_3. Let me recheck:

Compute β1*β2*β3: 9*40=360; 360*63=22680.

[S]^3=0.1^3=0.001.

22680 *0.001=22.68. So term_3 is 22.68.

Earlier I thought it was 25.2. Oh wait, no, I think I messed up in the initial calculation. So, let me recompute the terms with the correct term_3=22.68 and term_4 as 36.288.

So, the terms are:

term_0:1

term_1:0.9

term_2:3.6

term_3:22.68

term_4:36.288

Sum =1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

So, the fraction f_2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557 or ~5.56%.

Wait, but this still doesn't match any of the options. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the first three complexes, not four. Because β4 is 16, but perhaps the complexes don't form up to four ligands. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are only up to [Co(SCN)_3]^-. Let's think, perhaps the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0, and perhaps the other complexes are negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the given β's. The β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps each β is the overall stability constant for that complex, not stepwise. So, the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, has β1=9. The second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, has β2=40. The third complex, [Co(SCN)3]^-, has β3=63, and the fourth complex, [Co(SCN)4]^2-, has β4=16.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because β4 is lower than β3. Stability constants usually increase with more ligands, but in this case β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe the constants are stepwise, but in some other order. Alternatively, perhaps I've got the order of the β's wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the overall stability constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones. So, for example, the overall β for the second complex is β2=40, which would be the product of β1 and β2_step. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me consider that all possible complexes are present, but the one we're interested in is the dithiocyanato, which may be the second complex. So, the fraction for that would be term_2 divided by the sum of all terms.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute all terms correctly, because my previous calculation led to 5.5%, which doesn't match any options. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the stability constants are given as the overall constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones. So, for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. For the second complex, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β2=40. For the third, [Co(SCN)3]^-, β3=63, and for the fourth, [Co(SCN)4]^2-, β4=16.

But that would mean that each complex's stability constant is given, not the stepwise addition. But that would imply that the β for the second complex is not β1*β2, but β2=40. So, perhaps the approach is different.

In that case, the formation of each complex is considered as a single step. So, the fraction for each species would be:

f_k = (β_k [Co] [SCN]^k ) / D,

where D is the sum of all f_k terms.

But wait, that can't be correct because the stepwise formation would require considering the previous steps. Alternatively, each complex is formed in a single step with the given β as the overall constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the first four complexes, each with a given overall β.

In that case, the fraction for each complex would be:

f_k = (β_k [Co] [SCN]^k ) / D,

where D is the sum of f_k for k=1 to 4, plus the free Co^2+.

Wait, but that's not correct because the formation is stepwise. No, I think the proper way is to use the stepwise β's. So, each step adds one SCN, and the overall β for each complex is the product up to that step.

But let me go back. Let me compute the terms correctly.

Correct terms:

term_0: 1 * [Co] =1e-2.

term_1: β1 * [Co][S] =9 *1e-2 *0.1=9e-4.

term_2: β1 β2 [Co][S]^2=9 *40 *1e-2 *0.1^2= 360 *1e-2 *0.01=360e-4=3.6e-2.

term_3: β1 β2 β3 [Co][S]^3=9*40*63 *1e-2 *0.1^3= 22680 *1e-2 *0.001=22680e-5= 0.2268.

term_4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co][S]^4=9*40*63*16 *1e-2 *0.1^4= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880) → 362880 *1e-2 *0.0001=362880e-6=0.36288.

So, the sum D is:

[Co] (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

Which in terms of [Co]=1e-2:

But wait, since [Co] is 1e-2, each term is [Co] multiplied by the respective product of β's and [S]^k.

So, the terms are:

term_0:1e-2 *1 =1e-2.

term_1:1e-2 *9 *0.1 =1e-2 *0.9=9e-4.

term_2:1e-2 *9*40 *0.1^2=1e-2 *360 *0.01=1e-2 *3.6=0.036.

term_3:1e-2 *9*40*63 *0.1^3=1e-2 *22680 *0.001=1e-2 *22.68=0.2268.

term_4:1e-2 *9*40*63*16 *0.1^4=1e-2 *362880 *0.0001=1e-2 *36.288=0.36288.

Now, sum all terms:

term_0:0.01

term_1:0.0009

term_2:0.036

term_3:0.2268

term_4:0.36288

Sum: 0.01 +0.0009=0.0109; +0.036=0.0469; +0.2268=0.2737; +0.36288=0.63658.

So, D=0.63658.

The fraction for the dithiocyanato complex is term_2 / D =0.036 /0.63658≈0.05647 or ~5.65%.

Wait, but the options don't include 5.6%. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is not to be considered because the fourth complex is less stable. Or perhaps I'm supposed to only consider up to the third complex. Let me try without term_4.

So, terms up to term_3:

sum =0.01 +0.0009 +0.036 +0.2268=0.2737.

fraction for term_2:0.036/0.2737≈0.1316 →13.16%. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternative approach: perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complex as including both [Co(SCN)_2]^0 and any other complexes with two SCN ligands. But I think that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given as the overall constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones. For example, the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex has an overall β2=40. So, the fraction for each complex would be:

f_k = (β_k [Co][SCN]^k) / ( sum over k of (β_k [Co][SCN]^k) + [Co] )

Wait, but that approach might not be correct because each complex formation step is dependent on the previous ones. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one, using the overall β for that complex.

In that case, the fraction would be:

f_2 = (β2 [Co][SCN]^2) / ( [Co] + β1 [Co][SCN] + β2 [Co][SCN]^2 + β3 [Co][SCN]^3 + β4 [Co][SCN]^4 )

But wait, that would be treating each β as the overall constant for the corresponding complex. So, for [CoSCN]^+, the overall β is β1=9, [Co(SCN)₂]^0 has β=40, [Co(SCN)3]^− has β=63, and [Co(SCN)4]^2− has β=16.

But this approach would not account for the stepwise formation, which is usually the case. So, perhaps this isn't the right approach. Because the stepwise formation implies that each β is for adding one more ligand.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given as the overall constants for each complex. So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9 is the overall constant for that complex.

In that case, the concentration of [CoSCN]^+ would be:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co][SCN] / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each complex is formed from the previous one. So, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is:

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 [Co][SCN]^2 / (1 + β1 [S] + β1 β2 [S]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [S]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4 )

But then, the denominator is the same as before, which includes all possible complexes.

In that case, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2] is (β1 β2 [S]^2 ) / D, where D is the sum of all terms as previously calculated.

Earlier, with that approach, the fraction was about 5.5%, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the complexes are formed in a way where each complex is formed from the previous one, but the stability constants are given as the overall constants, not stepwise. So, [CoSCN]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)₂]^0 has β2=40, etc. So, the fraction for each complex is:

f_k = (β_k [Co][SCN]^k) / ( sum_{k=0}^n β_k [SCN]^k )

But since β0 would be 1 for the free Co^2+.

Wait, but that might not account for the stepwise additions correctly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the first three complexes. Let me try that.

With [S]=0.1 M and [Co]=0.01 M.

The terms are:

term_0: [Co] =0.01.

term_1: β1 [Co][S] =9 *0.01 *0.1=0.0009.

term_2: β1 β2 [Co][S]^2 =9*40 *0.01 *0.01=3.6e-3.

term_3: β1 β2 β3 [Co][S]^3=9*40*63 *0.01 *0.001= 22680 *0.01 *0.001=0.2268.

But I'm not including term_4.

Sum D=0.01 +0.0009=0.0109; +0.0036=0.0145; +0.2268=0.2413.

Wait, that can't be right because the terms are way too small. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the fraction is for the dithiocyanato is 0.0036 / 0.2413 ≈0.0149, which is 1.49%. Still no match.

This isn't working. Maybe I should try to look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the conditional formation constants, which include the concentrations. Let me think. The conditional stability constant K' is given by K' = β [SCN]^n.

Wait, but the fraction for each complex is (K'^n) / (1 + K' + K'^2 + K'^3 + K'^4 ), where K' = β [SCN].

Wait, no, that wouldn't be accurate. Let me think again.

The conditional stability constant K' would be K' = β [SCN].

So, for the first complex, K' = β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9.

For the second, K'^2 = (β1 β2 [S]^2 )= (9*40)*0.01=3.6.

Similarly, K'^3= (9*40*63)*0.001=22680 *0.001=22.68.

K'^4=(9*40*63*16)*0.0001=403200 *0.0001=40.32.

So, the sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +40.32=68.8.

The fraction for K'^2 is 3.6 /68.8=0.05227, which is about 5.23%.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only up to the third complex. Let me try that.

Sum without K'^4:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18. So sum is28.18.

Fraction:3.6 /28.18≈0.1277 →12.77%.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute the terms again.

Wait, let me compute term_3 again. β1 β2 β3=9*40*63=22680.

[S]^3= (0.1)^3=0.001.

So, term_3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term_4=β1 β2 β3 β4 * [S]^4=22680*16 *0.0001=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So, including all terms, the sum is 1+0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288=64.868.

Wait, earlier I thought sum was 64.468, but perhaps it's 64.868.

So, term_2=3.6.

3.6 /64.868≈0.0553 →5.53%.

Not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong β4. Because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So, perhaps the fourth complex isn't favored. So, perhaps it's negligible and not included.

So, sum would be 1 +0.9+3.6+22.68=28.18.

So, fraction=3.6/28.18≈0.1277 →12.77%.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement's β's. Let me read again.

The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is for the fourth complex, but maybe the complexes don't form beyond the third, or perhaps the β4 is for a different step.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are in a different order. Maybe β3 is for the fourth complex, and so on. But I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which includes any species with two SCN ligands. But in this case, perhaps the dithiocyanato is the second complex only.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the species up to the third complex. So, the fourth complex isn't considered. Let me compute without term_4.

So, terms are:

term_0:1

term_1:0.9

term_2:3.6

term_3:22.68.

Sum:1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18.

f_2=3.6/28.18≈0.1277 →12.77%.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the blue color, which corresponds to a different complex. Maybe the dithiocyanato isn't the second complex but a different one. Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given in reverse order.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the distribution of the complexes considering all possible species and find the percentage for the dithiocyanato, but that's not working out.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute the fraction in a different way.

Let me compute each term correctly:

With [SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute each term:

term_0 =1 →1.

term_1= β1 * [S]=9 * 0.1=0.9.

term_2= β1 β2 [S]^2=9 *40 * 0.01=3.6.

term_3=β1 β2 β3 [S]^3=9*40*63 * 0.001= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

term_4=β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001= 403200 *0.0001=40.32.

Sum=1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +40.32=68.5.

So, sum=68.5.

Now, fraction f_2=3.6 /68.5 ≈0.05254 →5.25%.

Hmm, still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of term_4. Let's recheck.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

β1*β2 =360.

β1*β2*β3=360*63=22680.

β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

[S]^4=0.1^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So, term_4=36.288.

So, sum=1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So, f_2=3.6/64.468≈0.05557 →5.56%.

Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the percentage of all species that have exactly two SCN ligands, including any possible isomers. But I think that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all the cobalt species, including the free ion and all complexes. So, that would be the same as the fraction I've been calculating. But again, it's about 5%, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm handling the stability constants. Let me think about the order of the complexes.

Another approach: perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is the third complex, [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

Wait, no, that's the trithiocyanato. Dithiocyanato would be two ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the overall stability constants, not the stepwise ones. So, each β represents the overall constant for that complex.

So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^-: β3=63.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}: β4=16.

In that case, the fraction for each complex would be:

f_k = (β_k [Co][SCN]^k ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 (β_k [SCN]^k ) )

But wait, β0 would be 1 for the free Co^2+.

Wait, no, because β0 isn't given. Alternatively, perhaps the free Co^2+ is considered as k=0, with β0=1.

So, the terms would be:

term_0: β0 [Co][S]^0 =1 *0.01 *1=0.01.

term_1:β1 [Co][S]^1 =9 *0.01 *0.1=0.0009.

term_2:β2 [Co][S]^2=40 *0.01 *0.01=0.0004.

term_3:β3 [Co][S]^3=63 *0.01 *0.001=0.000063.

term_4:β4 [Co][S]^4=16 *0.01 *0.0001=0.00000016.

Now, sum D=0.01 +0.0009=0.0109; +0.0004=0.0113; +0.000063=0.011363; +0.00000016≈0.01136316.

Now, the fraction for term_2 is 0.0004 / 0.01136316 ≈0.0352, which is about 3.52%.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate each complex's concentration using the overall β and then sum.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex as the sum of all species with two SCN ligands, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the β's are given in a different way. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, perhaps the problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all the Co species. So, the sum includes all Co species, and the dithiocyanato is just one of them.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formation constants in a way where the species are [Co], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

The fraction for each would be:

f_k = (β1 β2 ... βk [Co][SCN]^k ) / D,

where D is the sum for k=0 to 4.

So, with terms as I calculated earlier, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is ~5.56%.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the β's are given as the overall constants, not stepwise.

In that case, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^-: β3=63.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^2-: β4=16.

Then, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be:

f_2 = (β2 [Co][SCN]^2) / ( [Co] + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

numerator =40 *0.01 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01 *0.01=0.0004.

denominator=0.01 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute denominator:

0.01 +0.9 +40*0.01=0.4→0.01+0.9=0.91; +0.4=1.31.

63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063 →1.31+0.063=1.373.

16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016 →1.373+0.0016=1.3746.

So denominator=1.3746.

So f_2=0.0004 /1.3746≈0.000291 →0.0291%, which is way too low.

Hmm, not matching any options.

This is getting frustrating. I'm clearly missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the fraction of the nth complex as:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n )

In that case, the denominator would be sum from k=0 to n of (β1...βk [SCN]^k )

So, for the dithiocyanato (n=2), the fraction is:

f_2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 )

Plugging in the numbers:

numerator=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

denominator=1 +9*0.1 +3.6=1+0.9+3.6=5.5.

f_2=3.6 /5.5=0.6545 →65.45%.

But that's not one of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, that's the fraction when only considering up to the second complex. But the other complexes (third and fourth) would also contribute, so perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the first three complexes, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the β's are given as the overall formation constants, and the question is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, considering all possible complexes.

But I'm stuck. I think I need to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps the solution lies in using the formula for the fraction of each species in terms of the overall stability constants and the concentrations.

The formula is:

f_k = (β1 β2 ... βk [Co][SCN]^k ) / ( [Co] + β1 [SCN][Co] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 [Co] + ... + β1 β2 ... βk [SCN]^k [Co] )

Which can be written as:

f_k = (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN]^k ) / ( sum_{i=0}^k (β1 ... βi [SCN]^i ) )

Because [Co] is a common factor in all terms.

So, for each k, term_k = product β's up to k * [SCN]^k.

So, the sum in the denominator is sum of term_0 to term_k_max, where k_max=4.

So, the sum is:

sum =1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Which, as calculated earlier, is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=64.868.

So, the fraction for term_2 is 3.6 /64.868≈0.0553 →5.53%.

Hmm. None of the options match, but perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the β's.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the β4 is for a different complex, such as the monodentate instead of polydentate. Alternatively, perhaps β4 is for a different charge state.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is for the third complex, and I've miscounted the steps.

Wait, perhaps β4 is for the third complex, making the overall β for the third complex β1*β2*β3=9*40*16=5760, but that doesn't make sense with the given β3=63.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the β's are given as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. So, the first complex has β1=9, the second β2=40, the third β3=63, and the fourth β4=16.

In that case, the fraction for each complex would be:

f_k = (β_k [SCN]^k [Co] ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN]^k [Co] + [Co] )

But I'm not sure. Let me try.

So, for each k:

term_0: [Co] =0.01.

term_1: β1 [Co][SCN] =9 *0.01 *0.1=0.0009.

term_2: β2 [Co][SCN]^2=40*0.01*(0.1)^2=40*0.01*0.01=0.0004.

term_3: β3 [Co][SCN]^3=63 *0.01 *0.001=0.000063.

term_4: β4 [Co][SCN]^4=16 *0.01 *0.0001=0.00000016.

Sum D=0.01 +0.0009=0.0109; +0.0004=0.0113; +0.000063=0.011363; +0.00000016≈0.01136316.

So, fraction for term_2: 0.0004 /0.01136316 ≈0.0352 →3.52%.

Still not matching any options.

I'm stuck. I think I need to try another approach. Perhaps considering that the product of β's increases rapidly, the majority of the Co is in the highest complex, but the options don't support that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex in the solution, regardless of other complexes, but I can't find a way to match the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula where the fraction is (β_k [SCN]^k) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ), and the options correspond to a different β arrangement.

Wait, taking a step back, let me consider that the correct answer is option C (38.1%).

But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recompute the sum.

With [Co]=0.01 M, [SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute each term:

term_0:1.

term_1: β1 [S] =9 *0.1=0.9.

term_2: β1 β2 [S]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6.

term_3:β1 β2 β3 [S]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

term_4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [S]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; 362880*(0.1)^4=36.288.

So, terms are 1,0.9,3.6,22.68,36.288.

Sum=1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So, the sum is 64.468.

Now, the fraction for term_2 is 3.6/64.468≈0.05557 →5.557%.

Hmm. Now I'm really stuck. None of the calculations are matching the options, which suggests I might have a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach where the fraction is (β1β2 [SCN]^2)/(β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + ...), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the log of the stability constants, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complex being [Co(SCN)₂]^−, not neutral. But that would change the way the complexes form.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given in a different order. For example, β1=9 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β2=40 for [Co(SCN)₃]^- etc. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given as the overall stability constants, not stepwise. So, for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β=40. Then, the fraction would be:

f_2 = (40 [Co][SCN]^2 ) / ( [Co] +9[SCN] +40 [SCN]^2 +63[SCN]^3 +16[SCN]^4 )

So, [Co]=0.01, [SCN]=0.1.

Compute numerator=40 *0.01 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01 *0.01=0.0004.

Denominator=0.01 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Which is:

0.01 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016= 0.01+0.9=0.91; +0.4=1.31; +0.063=1.373; +0.0016=1.3746.

So, fraction=0.0004 /1.3746≈0.000291 →0.029%, which is way too low.

Hmm.

Wait, I'm clearly not getting the right approach. Given that the options are much higher than my calculated 5.5%, perhaps I should consider that the problem is using the overall stability constant for the dithiocyanato complex, and not considering higher complexes.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is different. For example, perhaps the problem is considering only up to the third complex, and the fourth is negligible.

Let me try that.

Sum of terms up to term_3:

1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18.

So, f_2=3.6/28.18≈0.1277 →12.77%.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formation of the dithiocyanato complex as a separate step, and not considering the higher complexes. But that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the fraction of a specific complex as:

f_k = (β1 β2 ... βk [Co][SCN]^k ) / ([Co] + β1 [SCN][Co] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 [Co] + ... + β1 β2 ... βk [SCN]^k [Co] )

Which is the same as the previous approach.

But with the numbers I've got, it's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the β product. Let me recheck.

Wait, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, β1 β2=360, β1 β2 β3=22680, β1 β2 β3 β4=362880.

With [SCN]=0.1.

So:

term_0=1.

term_1=9 *0.1=0.9.

term_2=360 *0.01=3.6.

term_3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

term_4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum=1+0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288=64.868.

So, f_2=3.6/64.868=5.53%.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'm missing something but can't figure it out. Perhaps the correct answer is option C)38.1%, but I don't see how to get that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex as the sum of all possible complexes with two SCN ligands, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the β's in a different way, where each β is for a different complex, and I should sum the fractions for all complexes up to the second one.

Wait, let me think about another approach. Perhaps the problem is using the formula where the fraction is (β2 [S]^2) / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 ), treating β's as overall constants. So, the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex would be:

(β2 [S]^2) / (1 + β1 [S] + β2 [S]^2 + β3 [S]^3 + β4 [S]^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

β2=40, [S]=0.1.

So, numerator=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Denominator=1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001).

Compute:

1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So, fraction=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

Which is option D)16.9%.

Ah! That makes sense. So the fraction is about 16.9%.

So the correct answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species based on the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- **Stability constants**:  
  - β₁ = 9  
  - β₂ = 40  
  - β₃ = 63  
  - β₄ = 16  
- **Concentrations**:  
  - [Co] = 10⁻² M  
  - [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M  

The cobalt species present are:  
1. Free Co²⁺: [Co]  
2. [CoSCN]⁺: β₁ [Co][SCN]  
3. [Co(SCN)₂]⁰: β₁β₂ [Co][SCN]²  
4. [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₁β₂β₃ [Co][SCN]³  
5. [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₁β₂β₃β₄ [Co][SCN]⁴  

The fraction of each species is given by:  
\[
f_k = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_k [Co][SCN]^k}{\sum_{k=0}^4 (\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_k [Co][SCN]^k)}
\]  
where \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).  

### Calculations:
1. **Terms for each species**:  
   - \(k = 0\): \(1\)  
   - \(k = 1\): \(\beta_1 [SCN] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9\)  
   - \(k = 2\): \(\beta_1 \beta_2 [SCN]^2 = 9 \times 40 \times 0.1^2 = 3.6\)  
   - \(k = 3\): \(\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [SCN]^3 = 9 \times 40 \times 63 \times 0.1^3 = 22.68\)  
   - \(k = 4\): \(\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [SCN]^4 = 9 \times 40 \times 63 \times 16 \times 0.1^4 = 36.288\)  

2. **Sum of all terms**:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

3. **Fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰)**:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05557 \, (\text{or } 5.56\%)
   \]

### Reassessing the Approach:
The calculated fraction of 5.56% does not match any of the provided options. Upon reevaluating the problem, it appears the question may be using a different interpretation of the stability constants or focusing on a specific subset of species. If the fraction is instead calculated as:  
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [SCN]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [SCN] + \beta_2 [SCN]^2 + \beta_3 [SCN]^3 + \beta_4 [SCN]^4}
\]  
the results align with the options. Using this formula:  
- Numerator: \(\beta_2 [SCN]^2 = 40 \times 0.1^2 = 0.4\)  
- Denominator:  
  \[
  1 + \beta_1 [SCN] + \beta_2 [SCN]^2 + \beta_3 [SCN]^3 + \beta_4 [SCN]^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
  \]  
- Fraction:  
  \[
  f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, (\text{or } 16.9\%)
  \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, corresponding to option **D**.
