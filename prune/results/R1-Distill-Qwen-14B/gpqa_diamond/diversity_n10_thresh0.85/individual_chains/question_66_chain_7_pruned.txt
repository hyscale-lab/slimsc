Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see what I can remember.

SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. From what I recall, it's a framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators that preserve the Standard Model's gauge symmetry. These operators are added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, but they have to respect certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these, so I need to figure out which ones are mandatory.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so I think any operator added in SMEFT must also preserve that. Because if an operator didn't respect Lorentz symmetry, it would break the whole framework, right? So I'm pretty sure Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The Standard Model includes Poincare symmetry, so do the SMEFT operators also have to respect this? Or are they allowed to have terms that break translational invariance? I'm not entirely sure. I think operators in SMEFT are typically local, so they should respect Poincare symmetry. Because if they didn't, that would imply non-local terms, which might not make sense in the context of the theory. So option 2 (Poincare) might also be required. Wait, but sometimes effective theories can have nonrenormalizable terms which are local but not necessarily respecting all symmetries beyond the gauge. Hmm, no, I think SMEFT operators are local and thus should respect Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Now, what about CP symmetry? I remember that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry on its own, especially due to things like the CKM matrix which leads to CP violation. So if the Standard Model already violates CP, then the SMEFT operators shouldn't necessarily preserve CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP symmetry) is not a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry. The Standard Model, as far as I know, respects CPT symmetry. And any effective theory extending it should also respect CPT because it's a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. So any operator in SMEFT must preserve CPT symmetry. So option 4 is definitely a required symmetry.

Putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. Wait, but wait, does Poincare symmetry automatically include Lorentz? Because Poincare is Lorentz plus translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. But since the question lists Lorentz as 1 and Poincare as 2, do both have to be explicitly respected or is one a subset of the other?

Hmm. Well, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz, then respecting Poincare implies Lorentz is respected. But the question lists both. So perhaps in the SMEFT, the operators must respect both? Or is it that when you respect Poincare, you don't need to separately say Lorentz?

Wait, I think in the SMEFT, the operators are required to respect the Standard Model gauge symmetry and also Lorentz symmetry. Because the operators are written in a way that they are Lorentz scalars. So they have to respect Lorentz symmetry. And since Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries, the SMEFT terms are local, so they respect Poincare as well. But wait, do they have to? Because the SM itself respects Poincare, so any term added shouldn't break it. So I think both 1 and 2 are required.

But wait
