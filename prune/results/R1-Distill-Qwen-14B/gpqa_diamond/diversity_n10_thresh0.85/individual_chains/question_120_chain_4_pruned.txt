Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth when viewed from opposite points in the Earth's orbit. The formula I think is distance (d) in parsecs is the inverse of parallax, so d = 1/plx. So higher parallax means closer stars, and lower parallax means they're farther away.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax change with plx. So, like, if I look at a range of plx values, how does the count of stars in each range vary as plx increases or decreases.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution in the sky... but how does that translate into distance? Because the number of stars should depend on the volume of space they occupy. Since volume increases with the cube of distance, I think. Because volume is proportional to r^3, right?

Oh wait, but parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, distance is large. So if plx is x, distance is 1/x. So when plx increases, distance decreases.

Now, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a certain distance range (say, from d to d+Δd) would be the volume of that shell (which is 4πd²Δd) multiplied by the number density.

Wait, but the question is about plx ranges. So I need to express the volume in terms of plx. Let me think. Since d = 1/plx, then Δd would be -Δ(plx)/(plx)^2, because d = 1/plx, so Δd = - (1/(plx)^2) Δplx. Wait, I might be getting confused here.

Alternatively, let's make it step by step. The number of stars per unit range of plx (say, between plx and plx + dplx) would be the number of stars in that range of parallax. But how does that relate to the actual number of stars in that distance range?

So,
