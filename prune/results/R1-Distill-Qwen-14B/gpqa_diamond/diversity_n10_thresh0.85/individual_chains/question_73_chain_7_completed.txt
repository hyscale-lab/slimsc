Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting velocities like in classical mechanics, right? I remember something about using the velocity addition formula. Oh yeah, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which one is u and which is v? Since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds divided by 1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Oh wait, no, the relative speed would be the speed of B minus A, but considering direction. Wait, actually, no, in the problem, it's the relative speed between them. So if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c) but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds normally. So I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of one object in the other's frame. Wait, maybe I should think of it as: if astronaut A is moving at speed u and astronaut B at speed v in the same direction as A, then the speed of B relative to A is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, that might be the case. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of observer in the same frame as A. So from A's frame, his own speed is zero, and B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, let's get this straight. The velocities are both in the same direction, so to find the relative speed of B with respect to A, it's (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the speed of A relative to the rest frame, and v is the speed of B relative to the rest frame.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Let's say the rest frame is the lab frame, and in that frame, A is moving at u = 0.6c, and B is moving at v = 0.5c. So to find the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, we use the formula: (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²).

So plugging in: v is 0.5c, u is 0.6c. Wait, wait, no: in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, the speed of B is (v' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²)).

Wait, no, that would be (0.5c - 0.6c) = (-0.1c), but let's compute that.

So the numerator is 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v' = (-0.1c)/0.7 = (-1/7) c ≈ -0.1429c. But speed is a magnitude, so the relative speed would be 0.1429c, approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but wait, the options have 0.14c as an option, so that's looking good.

Now for the total energy. The system's total energy is the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy.

The relativistic energy of each is gamma*m*c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute each gamma.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c²) ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 = 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c and 5.96 mc². So that should be the correct answer.

Wait another thing: are there any other energies to consider, like kinetic energy? Oh no, the question asks for the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So each astronaut's energy is their gamma times m c², so summing 2.5 and 3.464 gives about 5.964, which rounds to 5.96 in the options. So option C would be the correct one.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is "v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2". So that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Part 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut),
- \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut).

Substituting the values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude. Therefore:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Part 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut:
- Mass: \( 2m \),
- Speed: \( 0.6c \).

Compute \( \gamma_1 \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy of the first astronaut:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut:
- Mass: \( 3m \),
- Speed: \( 0.5c \).

Compute \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy of the second astronaut:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:

\[
E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
