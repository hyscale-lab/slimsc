Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just use classical mechanics because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, I probably need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed.

Wait, the problem gives the two speeds as 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, from the perspective of astronaut A (the one moving at 0.6c), what is the speed of astronaut B (moving at 0.5c)? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. Since they're moving in the same direction, I should subtract their speeds, but relativistically.

The relativistic addition formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Here, u is the speed of B relative to the stationary frame, and v is the speed of A relative to the same frame. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Let me clarify: if I'm in the frame of astronaut A, and I want to find the speed of astronaut B, then u (B's speed) is 0.5c and v (A's speed) is 0.6c in the same direction.

Wait, no, actually, no. Because if A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So, the relative speed would be (u' - v')/(1 - (u'v')/c²), but I need to get the correct u' and v'.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as the velocity of B as seen from A's frame. So, in the lab frame, A is moving at v=0.6c, B at u=0.5c. So the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no. Because both are moving in the same direction. So from A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c, the speed of B would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But wait, wait. Let me make sure. The formula for relative velocity when frames are moving is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So substituting u=0.5c and v=0.6c, but wait: if u is B's speed in the lab frame, and v is A's speed in the lab frame, then the relative speed v_rel (from A's frame) would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but if u=0.5c and v=0.6c, then u - v is negative 0.1c. But the denominator would be 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction
