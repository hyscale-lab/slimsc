Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, okay, let me think about what's going on here.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, speed of light in the glass? Oh, right, because in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed we observe?

Wait, no. Because the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, not on the motion of the medium itself. Like, if you're in a car moving at a constant speed and you turn on the lights, the speed of light inside the car is still c/n, right? Because it's the medium that defines the speed, not the motion of the medium through the lab frame.

So in this case, the glass is moving, but the light's speed in the glass is v_light = c/n. But wait, the question is about the speed relative to the observer in the lab. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving, but the light inside is moving at c/n relative to the glass. So how does that translate to the lab frame?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of relative velocities. Like, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass at velocity u = c/n (since n is the index of refraction). But wait, that's the speed of light within the glass, which is in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So when you have two objects moving in the same direction, their velocities add up in a certain way. Wait, but velocities don't just add up linearly; you have to consider the frame of reference transformations.

Wait, but wait! The speed of light is always c in any inertial frame according to Einstein's postulate. Wait, but that's for light in a vacuum. Oh wait, but this is in a medium. So, does that mean that the speed of light in the medium is still c as measured in the lab frame? No, because in the medium, it's c/n.

Wait, but hold on. If the medium is moving, does that affect the speed as observed in the lab? Or does the speed of the medium not influence the speed of light within it? Because from what I remember, the speed of light in a medium is determined by the properties of the medium, not the motion of the medium.

But wait, this is a tricky point. Let me think again. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving at u = c/n relative to the glass. So from the lab frame, the speed of light would be u + v? Or is it more complicated because of relativity?

Wait, but wait a second. Since the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction, maybe we can use the classical velocity addition formula? Because velocities in non-relativistic cases just add up, but for relativistic speeds, it's different. But the problem doesn't specify whether v is small or not. Hmm, but the options don't look like they involve any relativistic terms, so maybe it's assuming non-relativistic.

So, using
