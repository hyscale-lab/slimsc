Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets with masses similar to Neptune. So both stars are like our Sun, and the planets are both Neptune-mass. They found both planets using the RV method, and the spectral shifts are given.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period of the planet?

I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the velocity. Oh wait, but I think the semi-amplitude depends on several factors, including the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Since both planets are in circular orbits, I guess we can assume sin i is the same, maybe 1 (edge-on, so maximum effect). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's given that i is the same for both, so we can ignore it for the ratio.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 day in seconds) * (P) )^(2/3) ) )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can simplify because M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, e is zero for circular orbits, so the (1 - e²) term is 1. So the formula simplifies.

Another approach: The semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )^(1/1), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π c ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and the planets have the same mass (Neptune), the difference in semi-amplitude must be due to their orbital periods.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the Doppler shift. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) is related to the velocity (v) by the formula:

Δλ / λ = v / c.

Here, lambda is the wavelength of the spectral line, c is the speed of light. The question gives the shifts in milliangstroms. So for Planet #1, Δλ1 = 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, Δλ2 =7 milliangstroms.

But because both are measured at the same wavelength (given the same spectral line), the ratio of the velocities is the same as the ratio of the shifts. So v1 / v2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5/7.

Wait, but how does the velocity relate to the orbital period? Since the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is due to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity is K, which is the semi-amplitude. So K is proportional to the velocity. So K1 = 5, K2=7 (in some unit), so K1/K2=5/7.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1.

Another thought: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

Hmm, maybe that's the formula. Let me get the exact expression.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3)

Assuming e=0 and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈
