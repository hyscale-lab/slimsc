Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. It's about a light beam moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember something about relativity and how different frames of reference affect measurements.

The question states that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. And the observer is in the lab, so their frame is stationary relative to the glass's movement. I'm a bit confused, but let me think about how these things work.

First, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, without any motion, the speed of light in the glass would be 1/n because c is given as 1 here. But since the glass is moving, does that affect how we measure the speed of the light in the lab frame?

I think this is a problem involving frame transformations, maybe using the Galilean or Lorentz transformations. Since v is the velocity of the glass, and it's moving in the same direction as the light, I need to find the speed as observed from the lab.

Wait, but Galilean transformations are for non-relativistic speeds, and Lorentz are for relativistic. I'm not sure what v is here. The problem says it's a constant velocity, but doesn't specify if it's small or significant. Hmm, the options don't seem to involve any gamma factors, so maybe it's a Galilean approach.

In the frame of the glass (let's call it S'), the light is moving at speed v_light' = c/n. But in the lab frame (S), the glass is moving at velocity v. So how do we find the velocity of the light in the lab frame?

Wait, using Galilean addition, the velocity in the lab frame would be the velocity in the glass frame plus the velocity of the glass. But wait, I need to be careful about directions.

The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in S', the light's velocity is c/n in the same direction as the glass's movement. The glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So adding the velocities, I think, would give (c/n) + v. But wait, that's if the light's direction is the same as the glass's motion.

Wait, but the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, no, the light is moving toward the observer because the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction as the beam. Hmm, maybe I should draw a diagram.

Wait, let me think again. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving in the same direction the light is moving. So the light is going from the glass towards the observer, who is in front of the glass's motion. That's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I should model this. In the glass frame S', the light is moving at speed 1/n. Since the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, I need to find the light's velocity in the lab frame S
