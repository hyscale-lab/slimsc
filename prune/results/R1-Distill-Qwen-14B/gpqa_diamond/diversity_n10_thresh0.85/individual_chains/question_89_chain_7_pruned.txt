Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on adamantane structures, but I remember it's a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a very rigid structure, kind of like four cyclohexane rings fused together.

The first reaction is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or substitution here. But given that it's dibrominated, maybe an E2 elimination? Wait, wait, when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? So the product would be an alkene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which makes me think of maybe some kind of epoxide? No, wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides usually have peaks around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O stretch, and the carbonyl would be something else.

Wait, another possibility. When a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in a vicinal dihalide, it can lead to elimination to form an alkene. Alternatively, if KOH is in excess and under certain conditions, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of elimination followed by rearrangement?

Wait, but the product's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. So maybe it's a ketone? But how would that form from a dihalide with KOH? Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl group? No, wait, the usual for KOH with a dihalide is elimination to form an alkene. But maybe if it's a cyclic dihalide, like 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination could form a cyclooctatetraene or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. But substitution would typically require a good leaving group, and with two leaving groups, perhaps it could form a diol? Wait, but diols would have OH groups, and their NMR would show broad peaks, but the given NMR doesn't indicate that. The NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a doublet, perhaps from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The other peaks are around 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H). That 4.79 could be an epoxide. Wait, no, in epoxides, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or an ester.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is more likely a ketone or an ester. Let me think again. If we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then under those conditions, perhaps more. Alternatively, if the base induces a ring expansion or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another thought. Maybe KOH is causing the formation of a Grignard-like reaction, but that's more with Mg and ethers. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amines. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH undergoes a dehydrohalogenation twice to form an alkene. So, the product would be adamantane with a double bond, making it an adamantene? But then, how does that fit with the NMR and IR?

Wait, the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a bit upfield for an alkene proton, but more likely a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Like an ether or an epoxide. Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, then the IR would have a peak around 1250 cm-1 for the C-O stretch, which I don't see mentioned. But the 1720 cm-1 is still a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester, but why would KOH form an ester? Wait, no, KOH is a base, not an acid. Maybe it's a ketone. How? Maybe via elimination and then some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a SN2 substitution, but with two bromines, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings, and 1,3-dibromo would have bromine on adjacent carbons in the structure. When KOH is heated with this, perhaps the bromide ions are eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent C-Br bonds break, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the product would be 1,3-diamadamantylene? Or maybe it forms a bridge.

Wait, but then, if it's an alkene, the IR should show a peak around 1650 cm-1 for the C=C stretch. But the IR here is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So I'm wrong about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't stop at the alkene. Maybe further reaction occurs. Oh, wait, perhaps the alkene is oxidized. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless there's another step.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone via some mechanism. How? Perhaps through a dehydrohalogenation followed by an elimination that creates a carbonyl? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a ring-opening to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it forms an epoxide. But I don't see how the bromines would directly form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diels-alder type of reaction, but that seems unlikely with KOH.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a doublet. Maybe it's an epoxide, but the coupling would be a quartet because each CH2 group is adjacent to an O. Wait, no, in epoxides, each CH2 is connected to an O and has two neighboring protons. So the splitting would be a quartet, but in the given NMR, it's a doublet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol. But geminal diols have protons that are equivalent, so they'd be a singlet. That doesn't fit the 4.79 ppm peak being a doublet.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, a ketone would have a carbonyl, which gives the IR peak at 1720. The 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 next to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone? But then, the NMR would have different peaks.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. So the product 1 is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, like two E2 reactions, leading to a carbonyl. But that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe the bromide ions leave, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbocation which then loses a proton to form a double bond. Wait, but that would form an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, wait, another possibility. Maybe the molecule undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, breaking into smaller fragments with carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms an oxide. If KOH reacts with the dibromide, perhaps it forms an epoxide. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could lead to epoxidation? But that usually requires peracids, not bases.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on product 1. Let's think about product 2. Product 1 is treated with excess Al(O-iPr)3 (aluminum isopropoxide). Al is a Lewis acid, commonly used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since product 1 has a carbonyl (from the IR), perhaps it's a ketone, and Al(O-iPr)3 could facilitate some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed after heating with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation? But product 1's structure would need to have an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Al(O-iPr)3 acts as a catalyst for some kind of elimination or rearrangement. Or maybe it's facilitating a Claisen or aldol condensation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but I'm not seeing that fit.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH could form a diketone via elimination. But how? Two E2 eliminations, each forming a carbonyl. But that's hard because each elimination would require a hydrogen anti to the leaving group. Maybe it's possible if the structure allows.

Alternatively, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, perhaps eliminating both would form an alkene with adjacent carbonyl groups. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the two eliminations create a conjugated diene, but I'm not seeing the ketone.

Hmm, maybe I should move forward and think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. Ozone typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two or more carbonyl compounds, depending on the structure.

But let's get back to product 1. The NMR of product 1 has:

- 4.79 ppm (2H)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 (2H)

The integration suggests a molecule with 14 hydrogens (2 + 10 + 2 =14). Adamantane has 10 hydrogens, so maybe product 1 is a derivative with more hydrogens? Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have 10 hydrogens as well, but two bromines. After reaction, the product would lose Br and gain something else.

Wait, let's recount. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has 10 H and 2 Br. When KOH is added, we lose 2 HBr (since KOH is in excess). So the product would have 10 H plus 2 O from KOH? No, because each HBr is H and Br. So each elimination would lose H and Br, but gain O maybe? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe the product is a diol. Wait, but earlier I thought the IR didn't fit a diol.

Wait, but if the product is a diol, the IR would show broad OH peaks, but the given IR only shows a peak at 1720. So that can't be.

Another approach: perhaps the product 1 is an epoxide. Then, the 4.79 ppm would be two equivalent protons on the epoxide, which are typically split into a quartet. But in the NMR, it's a doublet. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is part of a ring, causing the protons to couple in a different way.

Wait, the coupling in the NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H, maybe a doublet) suggests that each of these two H's is coupled to one neighboring proton. So maybe each is adjacent to one H. That would fit a CH2 group next to another CH2, but in a ring structure perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so product 1 has a ketone group. Then, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. Like a ketone with a CH2 next to it.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone, but that's unlikely given the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-ketone with some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH forms an epoxide and a ketone? No, that seems complicated.

Wait, another angle: let's think about what happens when a dihalide reacts with KOH. Vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So maybe product 1 is an alkene.

But then, why the IR peak at 1720 cm-1? Unless the alkene is conjugated to a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's an enone. But then, the IR would show the C=O at 1720 and the C=C around 1650.

Wait, but the product is a solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe that's an allylic CH2 group. But I'm not sure how that would give a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclopropane. But I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is a ketone, and the NMR is showing some other groups. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methyl group next to oxygen, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but I'm stuck on the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is a diethyl ether derivative, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 (2H) could be a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a lot of CH2 or CH groups in a rigid structure, perhaps the adamantane part. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

So maybe product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. Let's say the structure is something like O=C-CH2-... connected to an adamantane framework.

Wait, but then the IR would have a strong peak for the C=O. That makes sense.

So product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group and a CH2 group next to it.

Then, product 2 is formed by heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide. So Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. But since adamantane isn't aromatic, maybe it's used in some other way.

Wait, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the substrate needs to have an aromatic ring. Since adamantane doesn't, maybe this isn't the case.

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is the result of an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. So, when an epoxide is treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it could protonate the oxygen, making the ring more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. But without a solvent, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should proceed to the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bond was.

In the NMR of product 3, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those exchanging with D2O. So, the most deshielded H is likely near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

If product 3 has a carbonyl group, the adjacent H's would couple with neighboring H's. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis has a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The H's on CH2 would couple with each other (geminal coupling, but that's usually negligible) and with adjacent H's.

Wait, for example, if the structure is something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have H's that couple with each other (as a triplet, maybe) and with adjacent H's.

Alternatively, maybe the H's are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would have coupling with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. That would make each H a triplet of triplets, but wait, actually, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2, which are each split into a triplet themselves. Wait, perhaps that's a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, consider a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-X. The H's on the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's say the first CH2) would be split by the adjacent CH2 group. Each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet (n=2), leading to a triplet of triplets if there are other couplings. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each resulting fragment has a carbonyl group. The H's adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and show up around 2-3 ppm, perhaps. But the most deshielded H in product 3 would be near the carbonyl.

Wait, the deshielded H would be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=CH-CH2-O-R. No, perhaps more accurately, for a simple alkene like CH2=CH2, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, you get ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but in our case, product 2 must have a double bond that, when ozonolyzed, gives product 3 with a specific coupling pattern.

Wait, let me think about product 2. If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a double bond adjacent to the ketone. So, product 2 would have a conjugated enone system (C=O adjacent to C=C). Then, ozonolysis of that would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an enone would typically break the double bond and form a diketone or similar.

Wait, but the ozonolysis is done at -78°C, which is a cold condition, so it's likely a reductive workup, but in this case, dimethyl sulfide (a reductive workup agent) is used, which would prevent the formation of peroxides. So the ozonide would break into carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is an enone, then ozonolysis would break the double bond, and the carbonyl groups would remain. So product 3 would have two ketone groups where the double bond was.

Wait, but in that case, the H's adjacent to the ketones would be deshielded. Let's imagine the structure of product 3. Suppose product 2 is something like (CH2)2C=O, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an enol ether or an enone.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into a diketone.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to backtrack.

Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → something with a carbonyl (IR 1720).

Product 2: product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → maybe elimination forms a double bond adjacent to the ketone, making an enone.

Product 3: product 2 → ozonolysis → breaks the double bond into carbonyls, so product 3 is a diketone.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

Each H on this CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would split into a triplet. If there's another coupling (like with a neighboring group), it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled to two sets of H's, leading to more splitting.

Wait, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', the H's on the first CH2 (next to CO) would each couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each would be a triplet. But if the adjacent CH2 is itself split by another group, it might get more complex.

Alternatively, suppose the H's are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. Each H would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet.
