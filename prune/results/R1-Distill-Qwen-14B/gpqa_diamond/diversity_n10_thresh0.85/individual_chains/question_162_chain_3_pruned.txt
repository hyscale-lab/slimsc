Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in polar coordinates maybe? Because dx² + dy² is r² dr² + r² dθ², or something like that. Oh wait, no, in Cartesian coordinates, it's just dx² + dy². So maybe I should switch to polar coordinates to make things clearer.

Let me rewrite the metric in polar coordinates. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². Substituting that into the metric, I get ds² = [32 / (4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

Hmm, this looks like a two-dimensional metric, so we're dealing with a surface. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, often used in hyperbolic geometry. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

Wait, the metric given doesn't look like the standard pseudosphere metric. The standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) has a metric that's something like ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a))² dθ², where a is the radius of curvature. But here, it's more like ds² = (32/(4 - r²))(dr² + r² dθ²). Let me see if that's the same as a constant negative curvature.

Wait, in the standard metric for a surface of constant curvature, the line element in polar coordinates is ds² = dr² + (k r² + c²) dθ², where k is the curvature. For a pseudosphere, which is hyperbolic, k is negative. So maybe I can compare.

Wait, let's compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. Because if I can find that, I can figure out if it's a pseudosphere (which would have constant negative curvature) and then compute the area.

The general form for a metric in polar coordinates is ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) dθ². The Gaussian curvature K for such a metric is given by:

K = - (1/(2 B)) d/dr (A/B) )

Wait another formula I remember is that for a metric ds² = a² (dr² + r² dθ²) (where a is a function of r), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 r a²)) d/dr (r a²). Let me check that.

Alternatively, the formula for Gaussian curvature K is:

K = (1/(2√(g))) * [ (d/dx (√g * g_{yy} )) - (d/dy (√g * g_{xy} )) + ... ] but that's more complicated. Maybe it's easier to go back to the formula for K in terms of A and B.

Wait, A(r) is the coefficient of dr², which is 32/(4 - r²) in our case. B(r) is the coefficient of dθ², which is 32 r²/(4 - r²).

So, let me compute K = - (1/(2 B)) d/dr (A/B )

Wait, wait, wait, perhaps I should use another formula. There's a formula for K when the metric is diagonal in polar coordinates:

K = - [1/(2 B)] * d/dr (A / B)

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. The Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = A dr² + B dθ² is:

K = (1/(2√(AB))) [ (d/dr) (A/(2√(AB))) ) * (d/dr (B/(2√(AB))) ) ) ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to use a different approach. Since the metric is conformally flat (
