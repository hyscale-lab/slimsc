Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see...

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain. Oh right, the main proton-proton chain, I think. So if this branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun through various reactions. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) reactions and the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle. From what I recall, the pp chain is the dominant process in the Sun, producing about 90% of the neutrinos, while the CNO cycle handles the rest.

When the pp-III branch stops, does that affect the production of neutrinos? Oh right, the pp chain produces electron neutrinos (ν_e) mainly through the decay of beryllium-7. The pp-III branch is a specific part where three protons combine with a helium-3 ion to form beryllium-7, which then decays into lithium-7 and a positron and two neutrinos. Wait, no, actually, the decay of Be-7 into Li-7 and a positron and neutrino... I'm getting a bit confused. So, the pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain, which is a primary source of neutrinos.

If the pp-III branch stops, then that part of the chain can't proceed. But wait, other reactions in the pp chain might still occur. Or does stopping pp-III mean that the entire pp chain stops? No, because the pp chain has multiple branches. Oh, but the question specifies that only the pp-III branch stops, not the others. So other reactions continue as usual.

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, that would mean less of the neutrinos are being produced from that particular part. Because the pp chain produces most of the neutrinos, stopping a branch would decrease the total neutrino flux. But how does this affect the specific energy bands?

The question is about the ratio of flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the neutrino energy distribution changes when the pp-III branch stops.

I think the neutrino energy spectrum from the pp chain peaks at a certain energy. Let me try to remember: the dominant neutrino emission from the pp chain occurs around 0.4 MeV, but I might be mixing up the exact numbers. Oh wait, the neutrinos from the pp chain have energies around a few hundred keV to maybe a few MeV. The exact distribution depends on the specific reactions.

Wait, the pp chain produces neutrinos mainly in the 0.4 MeV to 1 MeV range. So the bands in question are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So both bands are in that mid-range.

But how does the production depend on energy? The pp-III branch produces certain neutrino energies. If that branch stops, does that remove a higher or lower energy component?

The pp-III branch involves the reaction: 3H + He-3 → Be-7 → 2H + e+ + ν_e. The neutrino energy in this case is lower because the mass difference is smaller. Or wait, the neutrino energy in the decay of Be-7 is lower, perhaps around 0.5 MeV or so. Let me think: the mass of Be-7 is about 7.0159 u, and Li-7 is about 7.0160 u. Wait, that can't be right because Be-7 is less than Li-7. Oh wait, Li-7 is 7.0160 u, Be-7 is 7.0159 u. So the mass difference is 0.0001 u. Using the conversion 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c², the mass difference is about 0.0001 * 931.5 ≈ 0.093 MeV. So the energy of the neutrino would be around that. So the neutrino from Be-7 decay would have lower energy, like about 0.09 MeV or 90 keV. So that's in the lower end of the spectrum.

Wait, but that's the neutrino from the decay. But the pp chain produces higher energy neutrinos elsewhere. Like in the reaction where Beryllium-8 decays into two helium-4 nuclei, which emits two neutrinos. I think that's part of the pp-I branch. The neutrinos from that decay would have higher energies. Oh right, the neutrinos from the Be-8 decay are higher energy, maybe around a few MeV.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the lower energy neutrinos (like around 90 keV) are not being produced. But the higher energy neutrinos, say in the 700-900 keV range, come from other parts of the pp chain, like the pp-I branch, or perhaps other reactions.

Wait, but how are the neutrinos distributed in energy? The majority of the neutrinos from the pp chain have energies around 0.1-0.5 MeV (100 keV to 500 keV). The higher energy ones (like 0.5 MeV and above) are a smaller fraction.

So if the pp-III branch stops, which produces lower energy neutrinos (around 90 keV), then the flux in the lower energy bands would decrease. But the higher bands, like 700-900 keV, are less affected because they come from other parts of the pp chain that are still active.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of the flux between two bands. So if pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) would both decrease, but how does the ratio change?

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact energy spectra. Let me think. The pp chain produces neutrinos with a broad spectrum, but the majority are in the lower energies. So the flux in the 700-800 keV band and the 800-900 keV band would be lower than normal, but the question is about their ratio.

Wait, if the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a certain fraction of the neutrinos in the lower energy bands, and the higher energy bands are produced by other branches (like pp-I), then stopping pp-III would primarily affect the lower energy neutrinos more. So the lower energy bands would see a bigger drop in flux.

But the bands in question (700-800 and 800-900 keV) are both in the higher end of the typical neutrino energies. So if the pp-III is stopped, which produces lower energy neutrinos, then the higher energy neutrinos would still be produced as before.

Wait, but does the pp chain have different branches that contribute to the same energy bands? Let me think. The pp-I reaction produces two neutrinos, each with about 1.4 MeV. So that's higher than both our
