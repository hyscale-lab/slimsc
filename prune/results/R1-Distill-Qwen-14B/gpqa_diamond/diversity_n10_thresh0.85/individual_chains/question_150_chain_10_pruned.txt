Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and the compound is reacted with a set of reagents. I need to find out what the final product is among the options given.

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound using the NMR data. Then I'll think about how each reagent affects it step by step.

The NMR data is:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each peak.

Starting with the 9.72 ppm triplet. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So that makes sense. So there's an aldehyde group somewhere.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Similarly, 6.51 (d, 2H) is another aromatic doublet. Wait, maybe these are from two different aromatic rings? Like maybe para-substituted benzene rings because the doublets might be from coupling between adjacent protons in a para-substituted structure.

Wait, but if the coupling is between two protons on adjacent positions, that would make sense for an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ring, but para would give two doublets.

Wait, another thought: maybe these are two separate aromatic groups. Like, perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings attached to some structure. Let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. So the formula can be broken down as C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond or ring (another 2), and maybe an amine or something else.

Wait, but the molecular formula has one N. So maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR, the 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar, but the shift is 3.66, which is typical for an OCH2 group, perhaps part of an ether or something.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) is another aromatic region. Broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange or perhaps protons that are not coupled tightly, like maybe adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group or in a conjugated system.

Putting this together: the compound has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings, maybe each substituted in the para position, and some CH2 groups attached to oxygen.

Wait, another thought: the structure might be an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. Let me try to draw a possible structure.

Looking at the NMR, the triplet at 9.72 is the aldehyde proton. The aromatic region shows two doublets, which could be two para-substituted benzene rings, each with another substituent. For example, maybe each benzene is attached to some group, like a CH2 group.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests maybe a -CH2- group attached to something. So perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a CH2 connected to another group.

Wait,
