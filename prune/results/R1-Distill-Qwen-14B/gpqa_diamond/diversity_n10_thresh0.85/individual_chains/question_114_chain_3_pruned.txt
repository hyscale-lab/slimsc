Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are combinations of H3O+ and NaHSO3 for A, and HCl and CH3COOH for B.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually an addition reaction. Oh right! It's the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin reaction. So, the general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin.

Wait, but how does that work? I think the mechanism involves the nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, what conditions are required for this to happen? Oh yeah, I remember that the reaction typically uses a strong acid as a catalyst. Because the acid helps to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, which makes the addition of CN- easier.

So, in the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN in the presence of a reagent A to form the cyanohydrin. NaCN provides the CN- ion. So the reagent A is probably the acid catalyst. The options for A are H3O+ and NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, which makes sense for this reaction. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid and a source of bisulfite ions. Wait, but why would that be used here?

Wait, another possibility: sometimes in such reactions, you might use a mild acid or even a different catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction requires a base, but I don't think so here. Let's think again. The cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst. So, H3O+ (option A) is possible, but NaHSO3 is a bisulfite. Oh, wait, sodium bisulfite is often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, like in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. Because NaHSO3 can act as a source of H+ and S as a leaving group, but in this case, maybe it's acting as a proton source as well.

Wait, but sodium bisulfite is HSO3^- Na+. So in solution, it can provide H+ ions, right? So both H3O+ and NaHSO3 can act as acid sources. So which one is more suitable as a reagent A?

In the cyanohydrin reaction, the usual catalyst is H2SO4 or HCl. Alternatively, sometimes H3O+ (like from H2SO4) is used. So if option A is H3O+, that's a strong acid and fits. But what about NaHSO3? Could that work as a catalyst? I think NaHSO3 is less commonly used for this, but perhaps in some cases. Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question and the correct catalyst is H3O+.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Let me check the options. The options are:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B=HCl

So which is correct for the first step?

In the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the ketone (butan-2-one) has added CN- and OH- groups, but in the product, both are on the same carbon. Wait, but wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the
