Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. Hmm, stability constants... right, those are the equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes. So, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. I think blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) refers to the Co(SCN)_2 complex, right? Or maybe it's the tetra? No, I'm a bit confused about that. Oh, wait, the options are about the percentage, so maybe I need to calculate the distribution of each complex and find which corresponds to the blue one.

Wait, perhaps the blue color comes from a specific complex. I remember that Co(SCN)_2^+ is blue. Or was it Co(SCN)_4^2-? Hmm. Wait, the problem states that the "dithiocyanato" complex is blue. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So, Co(SCN)_2? Or is it a different charge?

Wait, let me think. The stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc. Stability constants for complexes are typically written as β_n, where n is the number of ligands. So, β1 is for the mono, β2 for di, etc. So β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, etc.

So, our goal is to find the percentage of Co(SCN)_2 in the solution. Or wait, which one is the blue one? The question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato implies two SCN per Co. So, the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+.

Wait, but the charge might differ. For Co(II
