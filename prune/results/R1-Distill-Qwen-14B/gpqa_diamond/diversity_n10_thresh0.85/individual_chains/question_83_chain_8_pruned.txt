Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see... The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react completely.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh wait, that makes sense because 20 + 20 is 40. Now, what's the concentration after dilution?

I think I need to use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's calculate that. 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, 25% of what? Oh right, 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point first, then take 25% of that.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate moles of acetic acid first. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). The initial solution is 0.025 M, volume 0.040 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

So the NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume V = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, 25% titration is 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me tackle each part separately.

First, the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, let's find the moles reacted. Moles of NaOH added at 2.5 cm³: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So, moles of acetic acid reacted is 0.00025, and moles remaining is initial moles (0.001) minus 0.00025, which is 0.00075. And moles of acetate ion produced is 0.00025.

But wait, the total volume now is initial volume (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH added. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can
