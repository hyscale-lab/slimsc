Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity yet. But I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the speeds normally because that's only correct at non-relativistic speeds. Oh right, there's this velocity addition formula in special relativity. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, wait—am I adding or subtracting here?

Wait, no. I think when you're finding the relative speed of one object from the frame of another, you use that formula. Let me think: If the two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference divided by 1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared.

So let me denote the two speeds as u and v. Wait, no, the formula is for the speed of one object from the frame of another. So if astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c relative to the lab frame, then from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, actually, A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, how fast is B moving? Or is it the other way around? Oh, wait, the question asks for the relative speed. So I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, but which one's perspective are we taking? The problem just says "relative speed," so I think it's the speed of one as seen by the other, but since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference divided by that factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the speed of the second astronaut as observed from the first one's frame. That's right, I think. So, using the velocity addition formula: u' = (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait,
