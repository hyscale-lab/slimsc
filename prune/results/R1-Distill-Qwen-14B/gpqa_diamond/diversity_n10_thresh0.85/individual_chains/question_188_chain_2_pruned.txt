Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, first, what's a rhombohedral crystal? I remember it's a type of crystal structure where all the lattice vectors are of equal length, and the angles between them are all the same. Oh wait, right! In a rhombohedral system, a=b=c and alpha=beta=gamma. So in this case, all the angles are 30 degrees. Got it.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. So that's a, which is the length of each lattice vector. So a = 10 Angstrom here.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha))).

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Oh right, another way to think about it is using the general formula for the interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice. The formula I think is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²
