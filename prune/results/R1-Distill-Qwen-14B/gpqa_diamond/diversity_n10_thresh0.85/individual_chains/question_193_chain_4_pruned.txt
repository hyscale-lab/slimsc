Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller. The formula I think is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Parallax (in arcsec) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes—like Proxima Centauri has a larger parallax than a star that's really far away.

So the number of stars, N, varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N should be proportional to (r)^5. Because 1/( (1/r) )^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per
