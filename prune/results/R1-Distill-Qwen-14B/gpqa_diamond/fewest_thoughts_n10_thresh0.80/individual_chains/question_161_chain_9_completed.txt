Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, the mean free path is longer because there are fewer gas molecules around to collide with each other.

Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. Under these conditions, he found the mean free path λ1. But when he turned on the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. Why would that be?

Wait, when the electron beam is active, electrons are moving through the system. Those electrons could interact with the gas molecules. Oh, right! In an electron microscope, the electrons can cause electron scattering with the gas molecules. So when the beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are being ionized or excited more. 

But how does that affect the mean free path? Well, in the initial state (ultra-high vacuum), the gas molecules are just moving around, and the mean free path λ1 is based on their collisions with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons might collide with the gas molecules more frequently. These collisions are in addition to the gas molecules colliding with each other.

So the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the collision rate. If the collision rate increases when the electron beam is on, the mean free path would decrease. Because more collisions mean the gas molecules don't travel as far before bumping into something—either each other or the electrons.

Wait, but how does the electron beam affect the collision rate? The electron beam would introduce more particles (electrons) into the system. So the gas molecules have more targets to collide with, which would decrease their mean free path. So λ2 should be less than λ1.

So looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. That would make sense because when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules have more ways to collide, reducing their mean free path.

Other options: option A says λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1, which would mean it's longer. But that doesn't fit because adding more collisions should shorten the path. Option B says λ2 equals λ1, but Mike observed a change, so this can't be right. Option D is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1, which also doesn't make sense because we expect λ2 to be smaller, not larger or same.


In an ultra-high vacuum environment with a pressure of less than $10^{-9}$ Torr, the mean free path of gas molecules, $\lambda_1$, is determined by their infrequent collisions with each other. When the electron beam is activated in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, additional interactions occur between the gas molecules and the electrons. These interactions increase the collision rate of the gas molecules, as they now collide not only with each other but also with the electrons in the beam. 

The mean free path $\lambda$ is inversely proportional to the collision rate. Since the collision rate increases when the electron beam is on, the mean free path decreases. Therefore, $\lambda_2$, the mean free path under the electron beam, is shorter than $\lambda_1$. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** ($\lambda_2 \geq 1.22\lambda_1$) is incorrect because it suggests an increase in the mean free path, which contradicts the scenario where collisions increase.
- **Option B** ($\lambda_2 = \lambda_1$) is incorrect because Mike observed a change in the mean free path, ruling out no change.
- **Option C** ($\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$) is correct, as the increased collision rate due to electron interactions reduces the mean free path.
- **Option D** ($\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22\lambda_1$) is incorrect because it implies an increase in the mean free path, which is not consistent with the observed decrease.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that $\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$.

Answer: C
