Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this cosmology question about quasars and their comoving distance. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar are being made in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Oh wait, I remember that in quasars, the Lyman-alpha emission line is a prominent feature. But wait, the Lyman-alpha line is usually around 121 nm in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is longer, that must mean it's been redshifted.

So the rest wavelength λ0 is 121 nm, and the observed λ is 790 nm. The redshift z can be calculated using the formula:

z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1

Let me plug in the numbers. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. Subtract 1, so z ≈ 5.5289. Wait, that's a high redshift. So this quasar is really far away.

Now, the question asks about the comoving distance for a=1, which is the present time. The comoving distance is a way to measure the distance to an object, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance, D_c, is given by the integral of c/H(a) da from a=0 to a=1, but since we're at a=1, it's the integral from the quasar's time (a=1/(1+z)) to now.

Wait, I remember that the comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters. The parameters given are H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_lambda = 0.7, and the universe is flat (which makes sense since Ω_m + Ω_lambda = 1).

So the comoving distance D_c is given by (c / H0) * ∫(from a=0 to a=1) [1 / sqrt(Ω_m/a^3 + Ω_lambda/a^(3(1+w)) ) + ... ] da. Wait, wait, actually, the integral is from a=1/(1+z) to a=1 of 1/(a^2 * H(a)) da, or maybe I'm mixing up the limits. Let me think again.

The
