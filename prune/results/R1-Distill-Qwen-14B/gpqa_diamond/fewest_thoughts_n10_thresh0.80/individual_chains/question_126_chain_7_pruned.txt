Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. We need to find out how many peaks appear in each type of chromatogram.

First, let's break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone at position 3 of a hexane chain. The structure is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group, but wait, wait. The molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is at C3, and there's a methoxy group at C5. The configuration is S at C5.

When LAH is used, it reduces the ketone. So the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent and may also reduce other functional groups if present. But in this molecule, the only carbonyl is the ketone. So after reduction, it becomes a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The configuration at C5 is S. When the ketone at C3 is reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol at C3. So the product is (3S or 3R?) Let's think about the structure.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3, but that's 3-pentanone. Wait, no, hexane has six carbons. So hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3 is pentan-3-one, but hexan-3-one would have one more CH2 on each side? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, hexane is six carbons. So 3 is the third carbon.

So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that doesn't add up. Let's count:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, that's 3-pentanone, not hexanone. Oh, I'm getting confused. Let me
