Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere, and how that affects the brightness variations observed. The question is comparing this to the effect of an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, and we need to find the radius of such a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm, let's break down the information given. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. Now, one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. Each spot is cooler by 1000 K than the star's Teff. So, the spots are at 5000 K.

Photometric observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, so the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. This mimics the light curve of a transiting exoplanet, I guess, because when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.

But the question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? The amplitude here refers to the change in brightness when the planet transits.

Wait, the star's light curve without spots would have a different dip when a planet transits. So, the problem is setting up an equivalence between two scenarios: one where spots cause brightness variations, and another where a planet causes them. We need to find the planet radius that gives the same dip in brightness as the spot-induced variations.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. The star with spots is already showing a variation because of the spots' rotational modulation. But if instead, the star wasn't spotted, a planet of radius Rpl would cause a certain dip. So, we need to find Rpl such that the dip caused by the planet is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but how does the spot's temperature affect the brightness variation? Oh, right. When a spot is on the visible side of the star, it contributes less light because it's cooler. So, the total brightness depends on the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots and their temperatures.

Wait, but in the scenario without spots, the dip in brightness is purely due to the planet blocking some light. So, the dip is determined by the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But in the spotted case, the change in brightness is because the spots are cooler, but when they rotate into or out of view, the total brightness changes.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing two different effects. Let me clarify.

When the star is unspotted, the dip from a planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, right? The fractional change in brightness is the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk.

But when the star has spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots being on the day side or not. So, when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. The spots being cooler, so when they are facing us, the star appears dimmer than when the spots are on the other side (facing away).

But the filling factor is 20%, so 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (4π Rstar^2 / 2) ), because the hemisphere is half the star's surface. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So, the area is 0.2 * (2π Rstar^2), since each hemisphere is 2π R^2.

Wait, actually, the star's total surface area is 4π R^2. A hemisphere is 2π R^2. The filling factor is 20%, so the area with spots is 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Each spot has a lower temperature, so when it's on the side facing us, it contributes less flux. The idea is that when the star is viewed with the spots on the front, the total flux is less than when the spots are on the back.

So, the change in flux is the difference between when spots are visible and when they're not. So the variation in brightness is the amount by which the spots' cooler regions contribute less flux.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the presence of spots changes the star's overall brightness. Let me think about it. The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π Rstar^2 * sigma * Teff^4.

But when there are spots, the flux is F = F0 - (area of spots) * (sigma Teff^4 - sigma Tspot^4) + (area of unspotted regions) * sigma Teff^4.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the average flux when the spots are on the front and when they're on the back, and then the variation would be the difference between those two.

So, when the spots are on the front, the flux is F_front = (F0 - (area of spots) * (sigma (Teff^4 - Tspot^4))).

Wait, no, the unspotted regions contribute sigma Teff^4. The spotted regions contribute sigma Tspot^4. So, the total flux is:

F = (1 - f) * sigma Teff^4 * A + f * sigma Tspot^4 * A,

where f is the filling factor (0.2), and A is the area of the hemisphere (since the spots are only on one hemisphere). Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the star's surface is either spotted or not, but the spots are only on one hemisphere. So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are contributing their lower flux.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is visible (front), the flux is:

F_front = (1 - f) * sigma Teff^4 * A_hemi + f * sigma Tspot^4 * A_hemi,

where A_hemi is the area of the hemisphere, which is 2 pi R^2.

Similarly, when the other hemisphere is facing us (no spots), the flux is:

F_back = sigma Teff^4 * A_hemi.

Wait, no, because the other hemisphere is not covered by spots. So, when the spotted hemisphere is on the back, the star's front is entirely unspotted. So, the flux is F_back = sigma Teff^4 * A_hemi.

So the variation in flux when the star rotates is F_back - F_front.

Wait, but actually, the maximum and minimum fluxes would be F_back and F_front, respectively. The amplitude of the variation is (F_back - F_front)/F_back, perhaps? Or maybe the change in brightness is (F_back - F_front) compared to F_back.

Wait, when the star is spotted, the flux is F_front when the spots are visible, and F_back when they're not. So the change in brightness is F_back - F_front, and the amplitude would be this difference divided by the average flux.

Wait, no, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the relative brightness change is (F_back - F_front) / F_back.

Wait, let's model it precisely.

The star's flux without any spots is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

But when the star has spots, the flux depends on which hemisphere is facing us.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (F_back), the flux is:

F_back = 2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

Because it's half the surface area, and all of it is at Teff.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us (F_front), the flux is:

F_front = (2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4) * (1 - f) + (2 pi R^2 sigma) (Tspot^4) * f.

Wait, no, that's not right. The entire hemisphere is 2 pi R^2. The area covered by spots is f * 2 pi R^2. So, the flux from the spotted hemisphere is:

Flux = (2 pi R^2) * ( (1 - f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ) * sigma.

So, F_front = sigma * 2 pi R^2 [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ].

And F_back is when the hemisphere without spots is facing us: F_back = sigma * 2 pi R^2 Teff^4.

So the variation, when the star rotates, would be F_back - F_front.

So the change in flux is delta_F = F_back - F_front.

Plugging in the numbers:

delta_F = sigma * 2 pi R^2 [ Teff^4 - ( (1 - f) Teff^4 + f Tspot^4 ) ]

= sigma * 2 pi R^2 [ Teff^4 (1 - (1 - f)) - f Tspot^4 ]

= sigma * 2 pi R^2 [ f (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) ]

The amplitude of the brightness variation is this delta_F divided by the original flux when spots are not visible (F_back). So,

Amplitude = delta_F / F_back

= [ sigma 2 pi R^2 f (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) ] / [ sigma 2 pi R^2 Teff^4 ]

Simplify:

= f (Teff^4 - Tspot^4) / Teff^4

= f [ 1 - (Tspot^4 / Teff^4) ]

= f [ 1 - ( (Tspot / Teff) )^4 ]

Given that f = 0.2, Teff = 6000 K, Tspot = 5000 K.

So,

Amplitude = 0.2 [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 = (625 / 1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So,

1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2:

0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355%.

Wait, that's the amplitude due to the spots. So the brightness variation is about 10.355% of the star's flux when the spots are not visible.

Now, if there were a planet transiting, the amplitude would be (Rpl / Rstar)^2.

We need to find Rpl such that (Rpl / Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Wait, but wait a minute. For a planet, the dip is (Rpl / Rstar)^2; this is the fractional change in brightness when the planet blocks part of the star.

So to match the amplitude caused by the spots, which is 0.10355, the planet's (Rpl / Rstar)^2 must equal 0.10355.

Wait, but wait. The problem says, if the star was not covered by spots, what would the planet's radius need to be to produce the same amplitude as the spotted star's variation. So the amplitude from the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which should equal the amplitude from the spots, which is ~0.10355.

So,

(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So approximately 0.32. So the radius would be ~0.32 times the star's radius.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. Option A is ~0.39, which is higher.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Because the star's radius is equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. So Rpl = 0.32 R_sun.

But wait, wait, the planet's radius is Rpl, and the host star's radius is Rstar. So Rpl / Rstar = 0.32.

So the correct answer would be option D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculation.

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4=625, 6^4=1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So the amplitude is 0.10355, which is about 10.355%.

So the dip caused by the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355, so Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So yes, 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem states that when the star is not covered by spots, what is the planet radius to produce the same amplitude. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: when a planet transits, the brightness dip is the planet's area over the star's area. So (Rpl/Rstar)^2. But the question is comparing the amplitude of brightness variation caused by the planet to the amplitude caused by the spots.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the brightness variation caused by the star's dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Star Properties**:  
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).  
   - The star's effective temperature is \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor \( f = 0.2 \).  
   - The temperature of the spots is \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere alternates between being visible and hidden. The flux from the star depends on whether the spotted or unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer.  
   - The flux from the unspotted hemisphere is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{back}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot \text{Area of hemisphere} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2
     \]
   - The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{front}} = \sigma \left[ (1 - f) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right] \cdot 2 \pi R_{\text{star}}^2
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference in flux between the two cases, normalized to the unspotted flux:  
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_{\text{back}} - F_{\text{front}}}{F_{\text{back}}}
     \]
     Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{back}} \) and \( F_{\text{front}} \):  
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     Plugging in the values:  
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225
     \]
     Thus:  
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \cdot (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 \approx 0.10355
     \]
     The amplitude of the brightness variation is approximately \( 0.10355 \) or \( 10.355\% \).

3. **Brightness Variation Due to a Planet**:  
   When a planet transits the star, the fractional change in brightness is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
   \]
   To match the amplitude caused by the spots, we set:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
   \]
   Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):  
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
   \]
   Therefore, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet is approximately \( 0.32 \) times the radius of the host star.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Among the given options, the closest match is \( \mathbf{D) \, 0.32} \).
