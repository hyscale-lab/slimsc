Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a nucleus move at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, the problem says the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the atomic number for Li is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6, I think. So the mass we'll be dealing with is that of a Li-6 nucleus.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a particle is given by the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, E = γmc². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v. The formula for gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

The speed given is 0.96c. So v = 0.96c. Let me plug that into the gamma formula. So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2). Oh wait, the c squared terms cancel out. So it's 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2). Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So the square root of 0.0784 is... let me think. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Yeah, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, and 0.28 times 3.57 is about 1 (since 3.57 * 0.2
