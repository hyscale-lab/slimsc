Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Hmm, let's read the question again. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Oh, right, because Li usually has isotopes, and Li-6 is a common one.

The problem gives me four options for the energy in GeV. I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic energy equations. The speed here is 0.96 times the speed of light, which is pretty fast. So I think I'll need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which would be the relativistic energy.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which usually refers to the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Sometimes, people use 'energy' to mean total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. I need to figure out which one is being asked here.

So, the formula for total energy is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute γ first.

Calculating γ: v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So γ is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that square root. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So γ is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6, so the mass is roughly 6 times the mass of a proton. The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c². So 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Wait, but wait, wait. Actually, nucleons (protons and neutrons) have slightly different masses, but in practice, for heavy ions, people often approximate the mass as A times the proton mass. So I'll go with that approximation.

Wait, but the exact mass of a neutron is a bit less than a proton. The proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass would be: 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's calculate that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.
Adding them gives 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So the rest energy (mc²) is 5.6335 GeV approximately.

Then the total energy E is γ times mc². So E = 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.6335.

Hmm, 3.5 *5 is 17.5. Let's do it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.6335.

Well, let's break it down:

3 *5.6335 = 16.9005

0.5 *5.6335 = 2.81675 → sum so far 19.71725

0.0714 *5.6335 ≈ 0.0714 *5.6335 ≈ let's compute 5.6335 *0.07 = 0.3943, 5.6335 *0.0014≈0.007887. So total about 0.3943 +0.007887≈0.4022. So adding 0.4022 to 19.71725 gives around 20.11945 GeV.

Wait, that's the total energy. But the problem is about the collider's energy. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy?

Wait, in particle accelerators, the energy often refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify. The question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

In accelerators, when you talk about the beam energy, it's usually the kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially for heavy ions, they might refer to the total energy. I'm a bit confused here. Let's think.

The total energy E = γmc². The kinetic energy is E_kinetic = E - mc² = (γ - 1) mc².

So if the problem asks for the energy which gives a speed of 0.96c, perhaps it's referring to the kinetic energy. Alternatively, sometimes the total energy is called the beam energy.

Wait, but in the question, the speed is given as 0.96c. So the question is about the energy of the nucleus in the collider, which is moving at 0.96c.

In that case, the total energy would be γ mc², and the kinetic would be (γ-1) mc².

But I'm not sure which one is being asked. Let's look at the options. The options are A) 18.475 GeV, B)23.069 GeV, C)20.132 GeV, D)21.419.

Wait, earlier calculation when using approximate γ of about 3.57, and with the rest mass of about 5.63 GeV, E_total would be 3.57 *5.63 ≈ 20.12 GeV. So that's option C.

Alternatively, if we compute (γ-1) mc², that would be 2.57 *5.63 ≈ 14.45 GeV. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, which would be 20.12 GeV, matching option C.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation. Let me recompute γ.

v = 0.96c.

So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

γ = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784):

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yes, sqrt is exactly 0.28. So γ is exactly 1/(0.28) = 3.57142857...

Let me compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.633511 GeV.

So 3 *5.633511 = 16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute that:

0.5 *5.633511 = 2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 * 0.07 = 0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.0080542

So 0.39434577 + 0.0080542 ≈ 0.4024.

Adding to the 2.8167555 gives 3.219158.

So 3.57142857 *5.633511 = 16.900533 + 3.219158 = 20.11969 GeV. So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, that's option C: 20.132 GeV. Wait, but my calculation is 20.1197, which is about 20.12 GeV, but option C is 20.132. Hmm, maybe I was a bit approximate with the rest mass.

Wait, earlier calculation of the rest mass was 5.6335 GeV. Let me recheck that. The exact masses are:

Proton: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron: 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV → 5.633511 GeV. So that's correct.

So the total energy is 3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.633511 accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise gamma value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recompute beta = v/c =0.96.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So that's exact.

So 3.57142857 *5.633511 = let's compute step by step.

5.633511 *3 = 16.900533.

5.633511 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

So 5.633511 *4 = 22.534044.

Then 22.534044 divided by 7 is approximately 3.219149.

So adding 16.900533 and 3.219149 gives 20.119682 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.1197 GeV. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 20.1197 is very close to option C: 20.132. Hmm, the difference is about 0.0123 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the actual mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6 times the average of a nucleon, but perhaps a precise value. Because the binding energy in the nucleus can affect the actual mass.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 5.6396 GeV/c². Because in reality, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy, but wait, no, wait: Because when you form a nucleus, you release energy (binding energy), so the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. So maybe I was wrong in my earlier calculation.

Wait, but in particle physics, when calculating the energy, they often use the sum of the masses of the nucleons because the binding energy is negligible compared to the rest mass of the nucleons, especially for heavy ions.

Wait, the binding energy per nucleon for Li-6 is around 3 MeV, which is about 0.003 GeV. So 6 nucleons would have a binding energy of about 0.01
