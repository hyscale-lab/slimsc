Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, actually, it's plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1/d (d in parsecs). So if the distance increases, parallax decreases.

The number of stars, let's call it N, varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 over (1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, so it's the change in N with respect to distance, right? So we might need to take the derivative of N with respect to d. 

N is proportional to d^5. So dN/dd would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, the question is asking how the number changes per unit distance. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4, meaning that as d increases, the rate at which N increases also increases. 

But wait, the options are about the dependence on r, which I assume is the same as d. Let me look at the options. Option B is r^5, which is what N is proportional to, but the question is about the change in N with distance. So the rate of change (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4, right? Because dN/dr = 5 r^4. So in terms of how N changes per unit distance, it's proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So that's the derivative, I think. So the derivative would be proportional to r^4. But looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. N is proportional to plx^-5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k * (1/(plx))^5 = k*(d)^5. So N = k d^5. Then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is increasing as d^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

Alternatively, maybe the question isn't about the derivative but the total number in a shell. Oh wait, noâ€”distance is continuous. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be the derivative of the cumulative number. So the rate of change is dN/dr, which is proportional to r^4. So the answer is C.


The number of stars, \( N \), in the region varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the expression for \( N \) gives:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5.
\]

Thus, \( N \) is proportional to \( d^5 \). The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), which corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \) (or \( r \)):

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto \frac{d}{dr}(r^5) = 5r^4.
\]

This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
