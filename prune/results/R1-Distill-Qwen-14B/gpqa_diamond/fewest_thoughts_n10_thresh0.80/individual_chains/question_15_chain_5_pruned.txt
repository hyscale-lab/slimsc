Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see, the question is about which planet is more likely to transit its star, so that the researchers should prioritize observing that one.

First, what do I remember about transiting planets? Oh right, a transit happens when a planet passes directly in front of its host star from our point of view. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, but in this case, both planets are Earth-like, so their sizes are similar. So maybe the main factors are the orbital periods and the sizes of their stars.

The problem says both planets have the same minimum mass. So mass isn't the varying factor here. The key seems to be about the probability of the planet transiting, which I think depends on the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the planet's orbit.

Wait, actually, the probability of a transit is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance. Hmm, no, wait, let me think again. No, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to align edge-on with our line of sight. But wait, since the RV method already detected both, their orbits are likely not edge-on because RV method detects planets through Doppler shifts regardless of alignment. Oh, but maybe the RV method gives a minimum mass, so the actual mass could be higher. But that might not
