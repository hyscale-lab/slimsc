Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and the radiation they produce. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle depends on lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and also choose the possible form of the function f.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, especially in an antenna, the radiation pattern has a certain angular dependence. Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone) is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and falls off as theta approaches 0 or 180. The intensity or power per unit solid angle varies with theta.

The formula for the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is something like I = (something) * (sin(theta))^2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, dipole radiation has a pattern where the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta) for theta not too close to 0 or 180 degrees. But when theta is 0, meaning along the axis, the intensity is zero. So maximum is at 90 degrees.

So if the maximum is at theta=90, which has sin(theta)=1, then the intensity at theta=30 degrees would be sin^2(30) times the maximum. Sin(30) is 0.5, so squared is 0.25. So the fraction is a quarter.

Wait, but wait. What about the exact form of the function f? The problem says f is a function of lambda and theta. So the power per unit solid angle is f(lambda, theta).

I also remember that the power radiated by an oscillating charge depends on the acceleration and the current, but in terms of radiation, the power is proportional to the square of the acceleration, and the radiation resistance, etc. But in terms of the angular dependence, it's the sin^2(theta) term.

Now for the function f: the power per unit solid angle. What's its dependence on lambda?

Hmm. The power radiated by an oscill
