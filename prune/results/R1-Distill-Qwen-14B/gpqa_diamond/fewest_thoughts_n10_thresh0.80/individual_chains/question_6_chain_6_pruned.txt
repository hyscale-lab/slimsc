Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a given potential. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Wait, so this is in polar coordinates because it's a function of r and θ. I remember that in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation can be solved in polar coordinates for central potentials, but this potential doesn't look purely radial. Oh wait, it's actually a sum of terms involving r squared and another term involving cos squared theta. Maybe I can separate the variables or find out if the potential has any angular dependence that can be simplified.

Let me think about the form of the potential. The first term is (1/2) k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions. The harmonic oscillator's potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's expressed with k instead. So maybe k is related to m and ω squared? Wait, but the second term is (3/2) k r² cos²θ. That looks a bit like an anisotropic oscillator or something with angular components.

Wait, another approach: sometimes when potentials have angular dependence, you can express them in terms of angular momentum operators or use the concept of effective potentials. But I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite this potential in a way that separates the variables or breaks it into radial and angular parts.

Wait, I think I remember that sometimes a potential can be expressed in terms of r² times some function of theta, and that can be rewritten using the angular parts. Let me see. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's factor out r²: V = k r² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, cos squared theta can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in:

V = k r² [ (1/2) + (3/2) * (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ]
Let me compute that inside the brackets.

Expanding the terms: 1/2 + (3/2)*(1/2) + (3/2)*(cos(2θ)/2)
= 1/2 + 3/4 + (3/4) cos(2θ)
Adding the constants: 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 + 3/4 = 5/4.
So V = k r² [5/4 + (3/4) cos(2θ) ]

Hmm, maybe that's a way to write it, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of angular momentum or other operators. Alternatively, perhaps we can separate the problem into radial and angular parts.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, when dealing with angular variables, the Hamiltonian can often be written in terms of the angular part and the radial part. For a central potential, the potential only
