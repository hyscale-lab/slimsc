Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, I know that retroviruses are a type of virus that has RNA as its genetic material. Examples include HIV. So the question is about detecting this kind of virus quickly.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each suggests a different approach.

Let me start by recalling what each method entails.

Option A: Identify via symptoms, then nested PCR. Nested PCR is a method where you do PCR twice, increasing the specificity. But wait, for a newly discovered virus, relying on symptoms might not be accurate. Symptoms can be similar to other diseases, so using symptoms to identify the virus might not be reliable. Plus, in the case of an outbreak, quick identification is key, so maybe symptoms aren't the best initial approach.

Option B: cDNA sequencing first, then real-time PCR. Oh right, retroviruses have RNA, so to make DNA from their RNA, you need reverse transcriptase. So cDNA sequencing would help in identifying the virus. Real-time PCR is good for quantifying and detecting specific DNA sequences quickly. Since the virus's genome is RNA, perhaps you have to make cDNA first. So this method could work.

Option C: DNA sequencing first, then PCR. Wait, if the virus is a retrovirus, its genetic material is RNA, not DNA. So doing DNA sequencing might not directly detect the virus unless the virus's RNA is converted to DNA first. But maybe the option is considering that the host's DNA might be sequenced, which doesn't make sense for detecting the virus. So this option doesn't seem right.

Option D: IgG antibodies detected via ELISA. ELISA tests for antibodies, which would indicate a past or current infection. But for quick diagnosis, especially in the early stages, the virus might not have triggered a significant antibody response yet. Also, antibody tests might not be as sensitive or quick as PCR methods for initial detection.

So the process should start with identifying the virus. Since it's a retrovirus, we probably need to look at its RNA. So cDNA sequencing would be the first step, right? Once you have the sequence, you can design primers for a PCR-based test. Real-time PCR is efficient because it can amplify and detect the DNA in real-time, making it both quick and accurate.

Wait, why would you do cDNA sequencing first? Because to design primers for PCR, you need to know the sequence of the virus. So they probably isolate the virus, extract RNA, make cDNA, sequence it, and then use that info to design primers for the PCR kit.

Looking at the options, option B says first perform cDNA sequencing, then real-time PCR. That makes sense. Because once you know the cDNA sequence, you can target specific regions for amplification, and real-time PCR can give quick results.

Option A talks about nested PCR, which is more about increasing specificity. But the initial identification would need the correct target region, which requires knowing the sequence.

So the correct approach would be option B. First, identify the virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop real-time PCR for quick diagnosis.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is essential to consider the nature of retroviruses, which have RNA as their genetic material. The process begins with identifying the virus, which requires a reliable method. Using symptoms (Option A) is not ideal because symptoms can be nonspecific and may overlap with other diseases, making it unreliable for quick and accurate identification. Similarly, Option C suggests DNA sequencing, but since retroviruses have RNA, DNA sequencing alone would not directly detect the virus unless RNA is first converted to cDNA, which is not mentioned in this option. Option D proposes detecting IgG antibodies via ELISA, but this method is less sensitive and may not provide quick results, especially in the early stages of infection when antibody levels may be low.

Option B, on the other hand, starts with cDNA sequencing. This is the most appropriate approach because retroviruses have RNA, and cDNA sequencing allows for the identification of the viral genome by converting RNA to cDNA. Once the sequence is obtained, real-time PCR can be developed to target specific regions of the cDNA for rapid and accurate detection. Real-time PCR is efficient for amplifying and detecting specific sequences, making it ideal for quick diagnosis. This approach ensures both specificity and sensitivity, aligning with the requirements of a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak.

Answer: B
