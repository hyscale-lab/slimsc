Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these theories doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me think about each option one by one.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math manageable and get finite results. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have other mechanisms in place.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory deals with strings vibrating at different frequencies. Since it's a theory that incorporates higher dimensions and includes gravity, I believe it's a candidate for a theory of everything. But wait, string theory usually requires things like supersymmetry and might have issues with divergences at high energies? Or does it? Oh wait, because string theory is a background-dependent theory, maybe it doesn't have the same divergences as some other QFTs. Or does it? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Wait, I remember that in string theory, the interactions are different because it's based on strings instead of point particles. So perhaps string theory doesn't require regularization because the perturbative expansions are better behaved. Or maybe it's the opposite because higher-order terms could still be divergent. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes weaker due to asymptotic freedom. But wait, QCD does require regularization because it's a non-abelian gauge theory and has things like Landau poles if you don't handle it properly. Or maybe because it's a nonrenormalizable theory? No, wait, no. Wait, QCD is renormalizable. But does that mean it doesn't require regularization? No, because regularization is part of the renormalization process. So QCD does require regularization. So option B is not the correct answer because the question is which doesn't require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED does require regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences. But through renormalization, these divergences are absorbed into counterterms, giving finite results. So QED definitely needs regularization. So option C is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical ED doesn't involve quantum mechanics, so divergences like the infinite self-energy of a charge or the infinite energy of the electric field near a charge exist. But wait, in the classical theory, do we need regularization? Or do we just accept these infinities? I think in classical theory, you don't regularize because you don't perform loop integrals. Regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So classical ED doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So maybe option D is the answer.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So the answer would be the theory that doesn't have any divergences or doesn't need any regularization techniques.

So, looking at the options:

- Superstring Theory: I'm not entirely certain, but I think it might still require some form of regularization because it's still a quantum theory dealing with similar issues as QED and QCD, but perhaps in a different framework. Or maybe because it's a background-independent theory, it handles things differently. Alternatively, string theory calculations often involve the use of different regularizations, like the Pauli-Villars method or dimensional regularization.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So maybe it's the classical theory because it's not a quantum theory, and regularization is a quantum concept.

So, the answer is option D: Classical Electrodynamics.


To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze each option:

### Option A: Superstring Theory  
Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that incorporates strings instead of point particles and includes gravity. While it is a background-dependent theory, it still involves quantum field theory concepts and often requires regularization techniques, such as dimensional regularization, to handle divergences in calculations.
