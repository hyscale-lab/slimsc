Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, I remember that nuclear fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. 

Let's break down the problem. The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It's at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Then it fissions into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. Wait, so the masses are in a 2:1 ratio. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. Oh, so the initial mass M is 300 GeV/c², but when it splits, the two fragments' combined rest mass is 0.99*M. That means energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the fragments and probably some other particles like neutrons or gamma rays, but the question says nothing else is produced, so I guess kinetic energy is all? Wait, no, the problem says "two fragments (and nothing else)", so maybe just the two fragments. But wait, the rest mass after is 99% of M, which suggests that some mass has been converted into kinetic energy.

So, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. The sum of the rest energies of the two fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. That means the total energy released is 3 GeV, which goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments. But wait, the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. So, I need to find the kinetic energy T1 of the heavier fragment, and then compare the correct relativistic T1 with the classical approximation.

Wait, but wait: the sum of rest masses is 99% M, so the rest mass energy is 297 GeV. The initial rest mass was 300 GeV. So, the energy difference is 3 GeV, but that's the total mass-energy converted into kinetic energy. Because the initial nucleus was at rest, so all the energy comes from the mass difference.

But wait, in reality, in a fission reaction, the fragments have kinetic energy and maybe other energies like binding energy, but the problem states that we can ignore electrons, but I think the problem is simplifying things. So the total rest mass after fission is less than before, so the difference is the energy available for kinetic energy.

Wait, but energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. 

So, let me denote the rest masses: the more massive fragment has mass 2m, the other m. So the total rest mass is 3m. But wait, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99/3) M. But M is the initial mass, which is 300 GeV/c², so m = (0.99 * 300 GeV/c²) /3 = 99 GeV/c². So the lighter fragment is 99 GeV/c², and the heavier is 198 GeV/c². So their rest masses are 99 GeV and 198 GeV.

Wait, but 3m = 297 GeV, which is correct because 0.99 * 300 = 297. So m is 99 GeV, the other is 198 GeV. Got it.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero. Let's denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 (heavier) and v2 (lighter). 

But since momentum is conserved, p1 = -p2. The magnitudes will be equal: p1 = p2.

In relativistic terms, the momentum is gamma * m * v. So for each fragment, we have p1 = gamma1 * m1 * v1 and p2 = gamma2 * m2 * v2. Since p1 = -p2, the magnitudes are equal: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since the velocities are in opposite directions, their magnitudes will satisfy this equation.

But solving this in the relativistic case might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the center of momentum frame, which in this case is the same as the initial rest frame because the initial nucleus is at rest. So, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with velocities such that their momenta cancel.

But perhaps a better approach is to write the conservation of energy and momentum.
