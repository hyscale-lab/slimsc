Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The first part is about heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, forming an alkene. The reaction is typically E2, and since KOH is a strong base, it should promote elimination rather than substitution.

So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would probably produce an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes me think it's a diene or maybe an isolated alkene. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that's around the range for carbonyl groups (C=O), but wait, KOH is a base and when it reacts with dibromides, it forms alkenes. Oh, but wait, maybe it's a conjugated system or some sort of cyclic structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have Br atoms on two opposite positions. When KOH acts on it, perhaps it eliminates both bromides to form a double bond. So the product, product 1, would be 1,3-diene? Wait, no, because eliminating two Br's would form one double bond, but since they were on carbons 1 and 3, maybe it's a bridge structure.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Upon elimination with KOH, each Br leaves, and the adjacent hydrogens are abstracted, forming a double bond between those carbons. So the product after elimination would be an adamantane with a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. That would make it 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe a cyclohexene ring within the adamantane structure.

Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, elimination with KO
