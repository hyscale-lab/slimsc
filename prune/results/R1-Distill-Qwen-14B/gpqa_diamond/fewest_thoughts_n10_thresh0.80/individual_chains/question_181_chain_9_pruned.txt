Alright, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after a certain nuclear reaction stops. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Okay, the scenario is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8 and a half minutes ago. All other reactions continue as before. The question is about the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out what this ratio would be.

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then pp-II goes further, and pp-III is another branch, maybe involving more protons. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves a triple-alpha reaction or something else? Or wait, no, the pp chain usually refers to the proton-proton reactions, and the branches lead to different paths. Oh wait, the pp-III branch probably refers to a specific part where three protons fuse in a different pathway.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of these reactions. Mainly, the Beryllium-7 (Be-7) neutrino process is a significant source. But wait, in the Sun, the dominant neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I and pp-II branches. Oh wait, the pp-III branch might be another source of neutrinos, perhaps like the so-called 'he' neutrinos, which are higher energy. Or perhaps it's the main contributor to a certain energy range.

Wait, the pp chain has two main branches. The pp-I branch leads to the production of deuterium, and the pp-II and pp-III branches might involve more steps. Wait, no, I think the main branches are pp-I and pp-II. Or maybe pp-branches I, II, and III are all part of the same process but different steps. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch refers to the part that produces higher-energy neutrinos.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The proton-proton chain starts with two protons (H) fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. That's the pp-I branch. Then, another path where two deuterons fuse into helium-4, which is the main process. But wait, another branch (pp-II) involves a deuterium capturing a proton to form tritium, which then undergoes beta decay to helium-3 and emits a neutrino. Helium-3 then fuses with another helium-3 to form helium-4, releasing two protons. Oh wait, that's the main route.

Wait, but the question is about the pp-III branch. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch refers to the production of Be-7, which then captures a proton to form carbon-12 or something else, and that's another neutrino source. Wait, no, Be-7 is more associated with the so-called 'carbon-nitrogen-oxygen' (CNO) cycle, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in the pp chain, the pp-III branch would be the process where three protons fuse in a different way, producing helium-3 and a couple of neutrinos. Wait, but maybe the pp-III branch is another name for the process that produces higher-energy neutrinos, like the ones that contribute to the higher energy part of the solar neutrino spectrum.

But regardless, the question is what happens when the pp-III branch stops. So, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what's the effect on the neutrino flux in two different energy bands.

I know that the solar neutrino spectrum has peaks at certain energies. The lower-energy neutrinos (like around 200 keV) come from the main pp reactions, and the higher-energy ones (like around 500-800 keV and above) come from the Be-7 and other processes, especially the so-called 'he' neutrinos.

Wait, but neutrinos from the pp-III branch... I'm a bit unsure. Another thing I remember
