Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of these exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. The planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are given in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is based on the energy balance. The formula I remember is something like T = T_eff * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (Te) is given by the equation Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the orbital semi-major axis. Oh wait, alternatively, another version I've seen is Te = (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but L is the star's luminosity. But since the star is the same for all planets, L and σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) would cancel out when taking the ratio of temperatures between two planets.

Wait, but in this problem, the planets are in different orbits, so their a (semi-major axis) would be different. Since the orbital periods are given, but we know from Kepler's third law that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. So a ∝ P^(2/3).

But wait, the planets are in a ratio of periods 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So let's assign Planet_1 as the one with P1, Planet_2 has P2=2*P1, Planet_3 P3=2.5 P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5 P1, and Planet_5 P5=5 P1.

So for each planet, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a1 = k * P1^(2/3), a2 = k * (2 P1)^(2/3), etc., where k is the same constant for all planets since the same star.

The equilibrium temperature formula is Te = (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4). But since L, σ, and π are the same for all, the ratio of Te between Planet 4 and Planet 2 is determined by the ratio of (1/a^2) raised to the 1/4 power.

Wait, let me write it out. Te_4 / Te_2 = ( (1/a4²) / (1/a2²) )^(1/4) ) = ( (a2² / a4²) )^(1/4) )

Which is ( (a2 / a4 )² )^(1/4) ) = (a2/a4)^(1/2) )

So sqrt(a2/a4). But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), a2 = (P2)^(2/3) * a1, and a4 = (P4
