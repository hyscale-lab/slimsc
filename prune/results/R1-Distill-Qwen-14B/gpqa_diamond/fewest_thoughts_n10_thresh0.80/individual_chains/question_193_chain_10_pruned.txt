Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me think through it step by step. The question is about how the number of stars varies with distance, given a specific relation involving parallax. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says that in a region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. That means as r increases, plx decreases.

So if I substitute that into the given proportionality, let's see. Since N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, replacing plx with 1/r gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have r^5 as the answer. Or wait, the options are about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm misapplying the substitution.

Wait, no, I think I'm on the right track. Let me double-check. N ∝ 1/plx^5. plx is 1/r, so substituting: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Oh, wait, that's the key. Because when the problem says 'varies with parallax as 1/plx^5', that's the relation for the number of stars. But we need to find how the number changes as a function of distance, not parallax.

Wait, but wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then for a given range of r, the number of stars would increase as the distance increases. But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit distance. Oh, wait, perhaps it's about the differential number, like the number in a thin shell at radius r.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the differential. If N is proportional
