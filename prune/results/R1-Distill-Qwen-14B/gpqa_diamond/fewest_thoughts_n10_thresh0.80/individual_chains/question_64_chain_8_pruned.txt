Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these stoichiometry problems can get pretty tricky. But, I think I can work through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they decompose to form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes, and we get some data about the weight gains or losses in each tube.

So, the setup is: the gases go through three tubes in order. Tube 1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Tube 2 has a Ca(OH)2 solution. Tube 3 has red-hot copper.

The results are: Tube 1 gains 3.60 grams, Tube 3 gains 0.80 grams, and Tube 2 doesn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

Our goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each step.

First, the heating of A and B to 200°C. Since it's without air, probably no oxygen is involved, so decomposition reactions are likely.

The gases produced go through different reactions in each tube. Let's consider each tube's role.

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a deliquescent, meaning it can absorb water from the air. But in this case, the Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, and I think it might react with water vapor. Wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is already a salt, so perhaps it's used to absorb moisture. Or maybe it's used to absorb acid gases. Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, but in the presence of water vapor, it would form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, increasing the mass. So, the gain in mass here (3.60g) likely corresponds to the amount of water absorbed.

Wait, but if the original salts decompose, maybe they release water as a gas. So the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb the water vapor, increasing the tube's mass by the mass of the water.

So, tube 1 gained 3.60g, which is the mass of H2O absorbed.

The next tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the mass in tube 2 didn't change. Ca(OH)2 is a base, so if there were acidic gases like CO2, SO3, etc., they would react. Since there's no change, perhaps no acidic gases passed through. Or maybe the gases that would react are in a certain state. Alternatively, maybe the gases are neutral, like N2 or O2, and thus don't react.

Wait, but what about gases like H2O? Oh, but H2O would have been absorbed in tube 1. So the gases that reach tube 2 are non-reactive or maybe in a gaseous form that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2.

Wait, another thought: if the initial decomposition produces a mixture that includes H2O, which is absorbed in tube 1. The remaining gases pass through tube 2, which is a solution of Ca(OH)2. If any CO2 was present, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But since the mass in tube 2 didn't change, perhaps no CO2 was present. Or maybe any CO2 was already absorbed in tube 1 as water? That doesn't make sense because CO2 isn't H2O. So perhaps the gas that passed through tube 2 is something that doesn't react, like maybe O2, N2, etc.

Wait, but the initial reaction could produce some other gases. Let me think about what the possible products could be. If salts A and B are, say, nitrates, they might decompose into KNO3, which upon heating can produce KNO2, O2, and maybe other products. Or maybe they're sulfites or carbonates.

Wait, another angle: the gases after tube 1 and before tube 2 are non-acidic, so no CO2. What about H2 or O2? Or maybe NH3? Wait, perhaps the gases are a mixture of H2O (absorbed in tube 1) and something else. Or maybe the decomposition produces NH3 and H2O, but NH3 is a base and would react with Mg(ClO4)2? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but in tube 3, red-hot copper is present. So any gases that pass through this would react with copper. What reacts with copper upon heating? Maybe H2S would, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe SO2 or CO would react. Or if there's H2O vapor
