Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I remember that these types of problems require knowing the order of substituent introduction and the directing effects of each group.

First, I need to visualize the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a nitro group, a bromine, and a ketone (acetyl group). Wait, wait, noâ€”the formula is ethan-1-one, which is an acetyl group attached to the benzene. So the benzene ring has an acetyl group, a nitro group, and a bromine in specific positions.

Let me sketch this structure. The benzene ring has the acetyl group at position 1. Then, nitro at position 5 and bromo at position 3. Wait, numbering: when we have substituents, the numbering is such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, the acetyl is position 1. Then, moving clockwise, position 3 would be next, and position 5 is two positions away. So the substituents are at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (bromo), and 5 (nitro). Wait, that's a meta arrangement for bromo and nitro relative to each other, but let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at position 5 (which is meta to position 2, etc.), and bromo at position 3. So, the three substituents are at 1, 3, and 5 positions. So the benzene ring is tri-substituted with all groups in the meta positions relative to each other, but I'm a bit confused about how that would look. Maybe it's a para arrangement for some and meta for others. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is as follows: the benzene ring has three substituents. The acetyl is at one position, and the nitro and bromo are at the meta positions relative to each other. Alternatively, maybe the nitro is para to the acetyl, and the bromo is meta to the nitro. Or something else.

Wait, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethan-1-one. So, the substituents on the phenyl are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment (position 1). So, the acetyl is attached to position 1 of the benzene, and then the nitro is at position 5, and bromine at position 3. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2).

Wait, that's the structure. So the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5 positions. So, the ring is symmetric with those substituents.

Now, the problem is to figure out the sequence of reactions starting from benzene. The key here is the order in which substituents are introduced, considering the directing effects of each group.

I remember that nitro groups are meta directors, while acetyl groups (as ketones) are also meta directors. Bromine is a bit tricky; as a substituent, bromine is a meta director when it's a leaving group in certain conditions, but in some cases, it can be ortho/para if it's a substituent in electrophilic substitution.

Wait, wait. Let me think about each substituent's directing effect. Nitro groups are strong meta directors. Acetyl groups are meta directors because they're deactivating. So when we add substituents to the benzene ring, the order in which we add them will determine where the next substituent goes.

So, to get the substit
