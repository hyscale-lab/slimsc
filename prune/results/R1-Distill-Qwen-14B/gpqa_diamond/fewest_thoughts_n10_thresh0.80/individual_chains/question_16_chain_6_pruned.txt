Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which usually happens when a molecule has chiral centers, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. So my task is to look at each of the given compounds and determine if they have any chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry that would make them optically active.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Structure: I'm picturing but-1-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a Cl and a methyl group. Wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 would be Cl and the double bond. On C2, it's a methyl group and a double bond. But wait, the configuration is Z, which refers to the arrangement of the substituents around the double bond.

   For a double bond, the possibility of E/Z isomers arises when there are two different groups on each of the double-bond carbons. But does this make the molecule chiral? Well, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the groups on either side mirror each other. Let's think: on C1, the groups are Cl and CH2C(CH3)=. On C2, it's CH(CH3) and the double bond. Wait, maybe not. No, wait, in the case of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl-C double bond to CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 if it were single bonds, but with a double bond, it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Hmm, maybe not. Let me clarify: the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is connected via a double bond to C2. C2 has a methyl group and perhaps another substituent.

   Wait, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure would be Cl-CH
