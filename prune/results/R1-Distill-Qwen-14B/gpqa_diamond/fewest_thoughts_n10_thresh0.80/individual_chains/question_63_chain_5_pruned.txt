Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what that model entails. I think it's a model where the molecule's motion is considered both rotationally and vibrationally. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model probably allows for some stretching and compressing of the bond.

The question is about the molecule being in its fundamental state and absorbing a photon to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon. Oh, right, photons carry momentum equal to their energy divided by the speed of light. So p = E/c, where E is the energy of the photon and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but how does the molecule's state transition relate to this? The fundamental state must be the lowest energy state. The next state would be the next higher energy level. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration. So the molecule's state is a combination of vibrational and rotational energy.

Wait, the problem says it's in the fundamental state, which I think for diatomic molecules is the ground state of both vibration and rotation. So the fundamental state would be the lowest energy vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it can go to the next higher energy state. But what does "next state with the lowest possible energy" mean? I think it's the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But I remember that in such models, the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones. So the first transition is usually a vibrational one.

Wait, wait. No, the rotation-vibration model combines both. So the energy levels have both vibrational and rotational components. The energy of each state is given by E = E_vib + E_rot.

The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. To move to the next state, the molecule can either increase v or J. But what's the next state in terms of energy? The energy difference for a vibrational transition is much larger than that for a rotational transition. So the smallest possible energy photon would be the one causing a transition in rotation, but if the question is about the minimal photon needed to reach the next state, perhaps it's the one that allows the smallest energy jump.

Wait,
