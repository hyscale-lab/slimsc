Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c? They also mention that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope here would be lithium-6 because it has 3 neutrons (since Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons, and 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons total). So the nucleus is ^6Li.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity. The energy involved here is the total energy of the nucleus, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. But wait, sometimes in these contexts, they might just be asking for the kinetic energy. Or maybe they want the total energy? I'm a bit confused, but I'll think.

The problem gives the speed as 0.96c, so the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So relativistic effects are definitely in play here. I think I need to calculate the total energy, but maybe I should start by finding the gamma factor.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, because v is 0.96c, so let's compute that.

Let me compute v squared over c squared: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that accurately. 1/0.28 is about 3.57142857.

So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. The rest mass energy is mc². The mass m would be the mass of the ^6Li nucleus. So I need to find the mass of ^6Li in kilograms, then multiply by c squared to get the rest energy, but wait, maybe I can find the mass in atomic mass units (u) first.

I recall that 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. The mass of a ^6Li nucleus would be the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u (since the mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 GeV/c² when considering energy, but wait, in terms of u
