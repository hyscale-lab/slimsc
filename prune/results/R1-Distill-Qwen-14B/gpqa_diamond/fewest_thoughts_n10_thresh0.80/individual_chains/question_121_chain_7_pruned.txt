Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about reacting a specific epoxide with an organocuprate (Me2CuLi). I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and they do nucleophilic ring-opening of epoxides. But wait, the question says that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group is added to the less hindered carbon. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks.

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Hmm, let me try to visualize this structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it's a norbornane structure. The numbering probably goes such that the bridge is between carbons 1 and 4. The 7-oxa indicates an oxygen in place of a bridgehead carbon, so it's an epoxide. Wait, no, the 7-oxa would be an ether oxygen? Or is this an epoxide?

Wait, wait. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two bridgeheads. The substituents are at 1,3,4, and 6. The 7-oxa suggests an oxygen at position 7. But wait, the structure is bicyclo[4.1.0], so the bridge is between 1 and 4. The carbons are arranged in a way that 1 is connected to 6 and 4. The 7-oxa would be an oxygen attached, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to draw the structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane system with an epoxide oxygen. So, perhaps the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 2, making the ring. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has a bridge that's four carbons long, another that's one, and another that's zero. So the structure is similar to norborn
