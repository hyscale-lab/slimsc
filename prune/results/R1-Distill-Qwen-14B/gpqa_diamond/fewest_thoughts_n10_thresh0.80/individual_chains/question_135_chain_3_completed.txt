Okay, so I'm trying to solve this particle physics problem about the decay of a boson X. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian L(y) = -λf f(y)( υ + X(y) ) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh wait, probably it's written as L = -λ f f-bar [ψ](y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe that's a typo, perhaps the term is more like λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe the notation is a bit off, but I think the key is that the boson X couples to some fermion fields. 

So the boson X interacts with fermions, and its mass is 6 GeV. The question is about its possible decay channels at the lowest order.

I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because in pair production, each fermion must have at least some mass, so 2*m_fermion <= m_X.

Wait, but wait. The boson X's mass is 6 GeV. So the maximum possible mass of a fermion it can decay into is 3 GeV because 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

But wait, what particles have masses below 3 GeV? Let's recall the masses of the known fermions.

Leptons: electrons (≈0.0005 GeV), muons (≈0.105 GeV), taus (≈1.78 GeV), and the neutrinos are even lighter, but negligible.

Quarks: up and down are the lightest, but their masses are around a few MeV (like 2-5 MeV), so effectively massless compared to GeV scales. Then the strange quark is around 95-100 MeV, charm around 1.2-1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.1-4.7 GeV, top is way heavier (173 GeV). 

Wait, so the X boson is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where each is less than 3 GeV can be produced. Because each fermion would need to be at least 3 GeV each, but wait no, that would be 2*3=6. So each fermion can be up to 3 GeV. 

Wait, but fermions come in pairs, so each fermion in the pair must be less than or equal to 3 GeV. So the possible fermions are those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermions:

For quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But top is too heavy, as 173 GeV. So the others:

Up and down: ~2-5 MeV each, way below 3 GeV. So X can decay into uū or dđ. 

Strange quark is about 95-100 MeV, so their mass is about 0.1 GeV. So 2*0.1=0.2 GeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So sī is allowed.

Charm quark is around 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 =3 GeV, which is exactly the threshold. So c c-bar is allowed. 

Bottom is around 4.5 GeV. 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV, so b b-bar decay is not allowed. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for a fermion f, 2 m_f ≤ m_X → m_f ≤3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

So which fermions have mass ≤3 GeV? Let's list them.

Leptons: e (0.0005 GeV), mu (0.105 GeV), tau (1.78 GeV). All are ≤3 GeV, so their pairs can be produced.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm. Up and down are about 2-5 MeV, so definitely ≤3 GeV. Strange is ~100 MeV, which is 0.1 GeV. Charm is ~1.5 GeV. So their anti-pairs can be produced.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV, so not allowed. Top is way heavier, so no.

So possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs where m_f ≤3 GeV. So possible pairs are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u ū,

d đ,

s sī,

c c̄.

Wait, but what about the tau? Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. Wait no, wait, the X mass is 6 GeV. So 3.56 GeV is less than 6, so 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs.

Wait a second, no. Wait, 2m_f must be less than or equal to m_X. So m_f <= m_X/2 = 3 GeV.

Tau is 1.78 GeV. 1.78 <3 GeV, so yes, tau pairs are allowed.

Wait, but the tau is a lepton. So the decay X → tau+ tau- is allowed.

So the allowed fermion pairs are: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d đ, s sī, c c̄.

But wait, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b quark is 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is larger than X's 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So option A is incorrect because it includes b b̄.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So this includes all the fermions except b and t. But wait, does the X couple to these fermions?

Wait, the interaction Lagrangian is given. The term is λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe more accurately, the interaction term is something like λ f̄ ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps it's more along the lines of Yukawa coupling. Wait, perhaps the interaction is something like L = -λ f̄ ψ (v + X) ψ_f, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps it's a term like λ f̄ ψ (v + X) ψ_f.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is similar to Yukawa coupling, where the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

So the fermions that X can couple to are those that appear in the Lagrangian. So if the interaction is like Yukawa, then the fermion must be in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, but perhaps that's beyond what I need here.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is written as -λ f f-bar X, which would mean X couples to fermions. So any fermion that can be produced via this coupling would be allowed, provided the mass condition is met.

But the problem is, the given Lagrangian isn't entirely clear to me. Let me re-examine it.

The interaction is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar [ψ](y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps that's a typo, maybe it's something like -λ f̄ ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, that might not make sense dimensionally. Or perhaps the term is -λ f̄ ψ (y) [ (v + X(y)) ] ψ_f(y). Maybe it's a Dirac structure, but perhaps the term is a Yukawa coupling where X interacts with the fermions.

Well, perhaps the exact form isn't key here, but the fact that X can interact with fermions. So the possible decays are all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is ≤3 GeV.

So the allowed decays are pairs of the following particles:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u ū,

d đ,

s sī,

c c̄.

So looking at the options:

Option A includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That includes all the allowed fermions except for b and t quarks, which are too heavy. So option B includes c, which is allowed because 2m_c = ~3 GeV (since m_c ≈1.5 GeV), so yes.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so t t̄ is not allowed. So option C is incorrect because it includes t.

Option D includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So D is out.

So the correct option is B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but option B says "c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-". So that's all the possible allowed fermion pairs except for bottom and top. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait, another thing: the X boson's decay can produce any of these fermions as long as the mass is less than 3 GeV. The fermions with masses above that (like bottom quark) are excluded.

So the correct answer should include all these except the ones with m_f >3 GeV. So the allowed decays are those in option B.


The decay of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV is determined by the requirement that the total energy of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \). For a fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the condition is \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion. Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the maximum allowed fermion mass is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Neutrinos: Negligibly small mass, allowed.

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 3-5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (\( 2m_b > m_X \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.

Thus, the allowed decay channels are \( X \to e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t \gg m_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
