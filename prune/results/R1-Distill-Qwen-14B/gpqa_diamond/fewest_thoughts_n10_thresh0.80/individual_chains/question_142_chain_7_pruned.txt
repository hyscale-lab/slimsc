Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Since this ρ is an average of the projectors for |0⟩ and |1⟩, I think this might be a completely mixed state.

In qubit space, a pure state would be a density matrix like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, right? But here, we're adding two projectors and multiplying by 1/2. So each term is (|0⟩⟨0|) and (|1⟩⟨1|), each with coefficient 1/2. That means it's a mixed state because it's a probabilistic mixture of two orthogonal states.

Wait, what's the geometrical representation of a density matrix? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, any state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is written as (|ψ⟩⟨ψ|), which corresponds to a vector on the surface of the Bloch sphere.

But for mixed states, the density matrix is a statistical mixture. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere. The magnitude of r tells us how mixed the state is. If r has magnitude 1, it's a pure state. If it's less than 1, it's a mixed state. And if r is zero, then ρ is (I/2), which is the completely mixed state.

Looking at our ρ: ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write this in terms of the Pauli matrices. I know that |0⟩⟨0| is (I + σ_z)/2, and |1⟩⟨1| is (I - σ_z)/2. So let me substitute that in.

So ρ = (1/2) [ (I + σ_z)/2
