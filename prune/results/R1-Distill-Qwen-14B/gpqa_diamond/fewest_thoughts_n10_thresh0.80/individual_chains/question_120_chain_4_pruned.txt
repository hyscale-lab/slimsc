Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, the parallax p (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to distance, so distance d = 1/p. So as p increases, the distance decreases. Got it.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, like, how many stars are there when you look at a range from plx to plx + dplx, and how does that number change as plx changes.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density of stars (number per unit volume) is constant everywhere. So the total number of stars in a certain volume would be the number density multiplied by that volume.

But wait, parallax relates to distance. So for a given parallax range, what volume does that correspond to? Let me think about how to calculate the volume of stars at a certain distance.

Parallax p is 1/d, so when d is a certain distance, p is 1/d. But when considering a range in p, like from p to p + Δp, that's like looking at a shell in space at distance d to d + Δd, where Δd is the change in distance corresponding to that Δp.

Wait, let's do the math. Parallax p = 1/d → d = 1/p. So the change in d when p changes by Δp is Δd = - (1/p²) Δp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases (distance decreases), d decreases. But for the volume, maybe I should consider the change in volume for a thin shell at distance d with thickness Δd.

The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance from us) and dr is the thickness of the shell. So in terms of parallax, that's 4π(1/p)² * (Δd) → substituting Δd = -(1/p²) Δp, the volume element becomes 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p² Δp) ) → but the negative just indicates direction, so the magnitude would be 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) Δp ) → 4π (1/p^4) Δp. 

Wait, no, maybe I should approach it differently. The volume between distance d and d + Δd is (4/3)π (d+Δd)^3 - (4/3)π d^3. For small Δd, this approximates to 4π d² Δd. So the volume element is 4π d² dd.

Since d = 1/p, substituting d gives us 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p^2 dp ) because dd = - (1/p^2) dp. Wait, but perhaps I should express the volume in terms of p.

Alternatively, let's see. The volume element in terms of p. Since d = 1/p, then d(p) = 1/p. The volume between p and p+Δp is the volume at distance 1/p plus a thin shell. Wait, no, each Δp corresponds to a shell in space.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the differential volume per unit change in parallax.

The volume element at distance d is 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/p, then dd = -1/p² dp. So substituting:

dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp )

But wait, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, so the volume element should be positive. So, ignoring the sign for now, dV = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax p is (number density) * dV. Number density is constant, let's call it n. So the number of stars per unit range of p would be n * (4π/p^
