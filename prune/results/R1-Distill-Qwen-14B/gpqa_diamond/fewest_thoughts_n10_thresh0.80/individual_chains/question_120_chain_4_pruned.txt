Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it again. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are from A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance d is inversely proportional to parallax plx. So d = 1/plx, but wait, I think the actual formula uses parsecs, so plx (in arcseconds) is 1/d (where d is in parsecs). So yes, plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

Now, if the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is the same in all regions of space. So the number of stars should depend on the volume of space we're looking at. The number per unit volume is constant.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's think in terms of distance. A range of parallax means a range of distances. Let's say we have a small change in parallax, delta plx. What's the corresponding change in distance, delta d?

Since d = 1/plx, then delta d would be the derivative of d with respect to plx multiplied by delta plx. Let's calculate that. The derivative of d with respect to plx is dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So delta d ≈ |dd/dplx| * delta plx = (1/(plx)^2) * delta plx. Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so maybe I should express delta plx in terms of delta d.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to think about the number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + delta plx. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² delta r. Here, r would be the distance, which is 1/plx. So the volume would be 4π (d)^2 delta d, where d = 1/plx.

But delta d is related to delta plx. Let's express delta d in terms of delta plx. Since d = 1/plx, delta d = - (1/plx²) delta plx. So the magnitude would be delta d = (1/plx²) delta plx.

So substituting into the volume, the volume of the shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (delta plx / plx²) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The volume is 4π r² delta r. Here, r = 1/plx. So r² is 1/(plx)^2. And delta r is delta d, which is (1/(plx)^2) delta plx. So the volume becomes 4π (1/(plx)^2) * (1/(plx)^2 delta plx) )? That would be 4π (delta plx) / (plx)^4. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go step by step. Let's say we have a parallax plx. The distance d is 1/plx. The shell at distance d has a thickness of delta d. The volume of the shell is 4π d² delta d.

But delta d is the change in distance when plx changes by delta plx. So delta d = (d + delta d) - d = (1/(plx + delta plx)) - (1/plx). To a first approximation, this is approximately - (delta plx) / plx². So the magnitude is delta d ≈ (delta plx)/(plx²).

So the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (delta plx)/(plx²) ) = 4π delta plx / plx^4.

So the volume of the shell is proportional to delta plx divided by plx^4.

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume (because the density is uniform), the number of stars in this shell is proportional to (delta plx) / (plx^4).

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So per delta plx, the number is proportional to 1 / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx (i.e., per unit of plx) would scale as approximately 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait—the options are given as rates. Let me think again: the number of stars per unit plx (number per parsec of parallax, say) would be the number of stars in a delta plx range divided by delta plx, which is (4π delta plx / plx^4) * n, where n is the number density. So the number per unit pl
