Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass (like the Sun) each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet. The first planet caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and the second caused a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, I think the size of the Doppler shift relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet and the planet's orbital period.

The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K (the maximum velocity) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds) ) )^(1/3) )

But wait, since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So maybe it simplifies.

Alternatively, I think the relationship between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P comes into play here. Let's see, K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. 

Wait, another approach: the RV method's signal is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3). Or something like that. Wait, I might be confusing the exact formula.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3)

But since M_planet << M_star, we can ignore M_planet in the denominator, so:

K ≈ ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) )^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the formula where K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ), assuming sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum signal) and circular orbit (e=0, so denominator is 1).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Let me try to recall the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. From what I remember:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M
