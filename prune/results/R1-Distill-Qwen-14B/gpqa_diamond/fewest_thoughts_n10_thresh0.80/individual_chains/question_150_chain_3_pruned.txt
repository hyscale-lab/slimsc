Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is reacted with a series of reagents. I need to figure out what the starting material is based on the NMR data, then see what happens when it reacts with those reagents to find the final product.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, what's the degree of unsaturation here? Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2=9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I think I messed up. The formula is C8H9NO, so the calculation is (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Oh wait, wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here, since no halogens. So (2*8+2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Each ring or double bond is one. So possible options include rings, double bonds, etc.

Now, looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet around 9.7. High up, maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a triplet? Aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and show as a singlet or maybe a doublet if coupling with something else. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. Or perhaps an acidic proton like a phenolic OH, but that would be broad or maybe a singlet. Wait, but the integration is 1H. So maybe the aldehyde.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) – that's two protons as a doublet. Maybe para-substituted aromatic protons. Then 6.51 (d, 2H) – another doublet. Also aromatic. So perhaps two doublets in the aromatic region, which would suggest a substituted benzene ring with substituents in para positions.

Next, 6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe two protons. Could be an enol proton or something else. Or maybe it's adjacent to an oxygen, like an aldehyde or something.

3.66 (d, 2H) – two protons as a doublet. That could be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like O. Maybe a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester.

Putting this together, maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents. Looking at the NMR, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm could be two sets of para-substituted protons. So perhaps two phenyl groups attached in a para fashion. Or maybe a single benzene with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons. If it's two benzene rings (each has 6 carbons), but that's 12, which is way more than 8. So perhaps it's a single benzene ring and another group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with substituents. Alternatively, perhaps a substituted cinnamaldehyde or similar.

Wait, for the 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H: perhaps a CH2 group attached to something like an oxygen. For example, in a structure
