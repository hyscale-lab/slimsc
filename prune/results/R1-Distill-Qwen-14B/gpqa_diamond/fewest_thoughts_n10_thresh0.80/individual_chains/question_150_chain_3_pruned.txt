Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, so that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That can mean a couple of rings and/or double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4), a double bond, and an aromatic ring might be present.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that’s a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet might imply coupling with two equivalent protons. Or maybe it's an acidic proton like an enol or something else.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H) – doublet, two hydrogens. This could be aromatic protons, perhaps ortho or para positions. Let's see, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually as two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – another doublet, two H. Possibly part of a conjugated diene or another aromatic group. Wait, but wait, if it's two doublets, maybe they're adjacent in a di-substituted benzene.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, two H. Broad singlet could mean something like an -OH proton, but wait, that's usually around 1-5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an enol structure. Or maybe it's an aliphatic proton in a conjugated system. Hmm.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – doublet, two H. That seems like maybe a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like O. Such as OCH2 or maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. The doublet suggests coupling with one other set of protons, perhaps on adjacent carbons.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring and another aromatic group, maybe two benzene rings attached. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, C8H9NO: possible structures could be something like a substituted phenyl group attached to a side chain. Let me think about this. Suppose it's a phenyl group with substituents. The NMR suggests possibly two aromatic rings because of the two sets of doublets.

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have two H
