Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices in quantum computing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. This looks like a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability, right?

So each term |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors onto the computational basis states. When you add them together and multiply by 1/2, it's like saying the system is in a completely mixed state between |0⟩ and |1⟩. So this must be the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm. I think the Bloch sphere comes into play here. For a single qubit, any state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But for a mixed state, it's inside the sphere.

The maximally mixed state for a qubit is (I + |0⟩⟨0| - |1⟩⟨1|)/2, wait no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think. The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. When the state is maximally mixed, I think r is zero because it's the completely mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, another approach: the maximally mixed state has no coherence and equal populations in all basis states. So for a single qubit, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is exactly what this ρ is. So in Bloch sphere terms, this should correspond to the origin because there's no net spin in any direction.

Wait, but what's the Bloch vector r for a density matrix? Oh, right! The density matrix can be written as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. For the maximally mixed state, the diagonal terms are (1/2)(⟨0|0⟩ + ⟨0|1⟩? No, wait, the diagonal terms of ρ are (1/2)(1 + 1) for |0⟩ and |1⟩, so each is 1/2. The off-diagonal terms are zero because there's no coherence.

So the density matrix ρ is diagonal with entries [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2]. Comparing this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2: the diagonal terms come from (I + r_z σ_z)/2. Because σ_x and σ_y are off-diagonal, their coefficients must be zero because ρ has zero off-diagonal terms. So r_x = 0, r_y=0, and r_z is calculated from the diagonal terms.

The diagonal elements of (I + r_z σ_z)/2 are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. Our ρ has both diagonals equal to 1/2. So solving (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0. Same for the other diagonal term, it also gives r_z=0. So r = (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), the diagonal terms are both \(1/2\), and the off-diagonal terms are zero. This implies no coherence in the state (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\)) and no net spin in the \(z\)-direction (\(r_z = 0\)).

Thus, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere. Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
