Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (i.e., a statistical mixture of pure states). So this ρ must be a mixed state.

Wait, wait—what's the structure of a qubit's density matrix? A qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But when it's a mixed state, like here, it's a combination of projectors.

Looking at the given ρ, it's ½(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh, right! That's the density matrix for a completely mixed state. Because each state |0⟩ and |1⟩ is an orthogonal basis, and the coefficients sum to 1 (since ½ + ½ =1), so this is a maximally mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Wait, what's the geometric representation of a density matrix? I'm a bit confused. Oh, I think in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

But wait, the Bloch vector for a density matrix. The general form of a qubit density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). So r determines where on the Bloch sphere the state is located.

So let's compute r for the given ρ. Let me write out ρ explicitly. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So let's compute (I + r·σ)/2.

Wait, but for ρ, it's given as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute what this is in terms of the Bloch vector.

We know that |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, so ρ = (I)/2. Because when you add |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, you get I, the 2x2 identity matrix. Then, ρ becomes (I)/2.

So the density matrix is (1/2) * I. Now, how does this translate to the Bloch vector?

The general form: ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz ) / 2.

But when ρ is (I)/2, that means the terms with σ are zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but wait a minute. The Bloch vector for a completely mixed state is at the origin? Because the identity matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

So looking at the options, option C says r=(0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

Let me think again to make sure. The density matrix ρ = I/2 represents the maximally mixed state, which corresponds to the origin in Bloch sphere terms. So yeah, the geometrical position is at (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( r = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) corresponds to the coefficients of the Pauli matrices in the general form of a qubit density matrix:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} (r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z),
\]

where \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, it simplifies to \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), which implies that all coefficients of the Pauli matrices are zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \( r \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
