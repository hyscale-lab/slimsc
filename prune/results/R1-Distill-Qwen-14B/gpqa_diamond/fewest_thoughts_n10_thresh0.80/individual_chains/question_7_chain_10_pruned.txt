Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's all around the universe. The problem says that high-energy gamma-rays can annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this has to do with the interaction cross-section and the photon density in the universe. I remember that for a photon's lifetime to be limited by a certain interaction, the mean free path should be similar to the size of the universe. Or maybe it's the other way around— the lifetime is determined by the inverse of the interaction rate.

So, the interaction rate would depend on the cross-section (sigma) multiplied by the number of target photons (n). The lifetime tau is inversely proportional to this rate. So, tau = 1/(sigma * n). But wait, I think it's actually the mean free time, which is 1/(sigma * n), so the lifetime is limited when this mean free time becomes comparable to the age of the universe or something like that.

The cross-section for gamma-gamma to e+e- annihilation... I think this process is a photon-photon interaction creating an electron-positron pair. The cross-section probably depends on the energy of the photons. There's a threshold energy involved here. The threshold for pair production by two photons is when the combined energy is at least twice the electron mass. But wait, the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV. So for each photon, the energies have to add up to at least that. But in this case, one photon is the high-energy gamma, and the other is the CMB photon.

Wait, no. The process is gamma + photon → e+ e-. So the center-of-mass energy has to be at least 2m_e c^2. So each photon's energy plus the other's must be sufficient. So the minimum energy for each photon is when they're both equal, because that's the case where each contributes the least. So each would need to be about 1 MeV. But wait, the CMB photon is way lower in energy—1e-3 eV. So maybe the high-energy gamma-ray photon needs to have enough energy so that when combined with the CMB photon's energy, the sum meets the threshold.

Wait, but the CMB photon's energy is 1e-3 eV, which is way less than the electron mass, which is ~1e6 eV. So the CMB photon alone isn't enough. So the high-energy gamma needs to have enough energy so that when it interacts with the CMB photon, the combined energy is at least 2 m_e c^2.

Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, the cross-section for photon-photon pair production becomes significant when the photon energies are above a certain
