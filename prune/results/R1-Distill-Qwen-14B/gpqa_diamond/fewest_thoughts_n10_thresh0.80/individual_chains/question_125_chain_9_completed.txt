Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator is a standard problem, and in three dimensions, it's often treated as three independent one-dimensional oscillators in each spatial direction (x, y, z). But wait, is this the case for the isotropic 3D oscillator? Oh right, yes, because the potential depends only on r squared, which is x² + y² + z², so the problem separates into three independent 1D oscillators.

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm. Let me think.

First, I need to figure out what the energy levels are for the 3D harmonic oscillator. In one dimension, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). In three dimensions, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So, the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or wait, sometimes it's written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers.

Wait, but what's the ground state? The ground state would be when n_x, n_y, n_z are all 0. So n=0, giving E = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when one of the n's is 1 and the others are 0, so n=1, E = (5/2) ħω. The second excited state would be n=2, giving E= (7/2) ħω. The third excited state would be n=3, so E= (9/2) ħω. That seems right. So the energy part of the answer should be (9/2) ħω.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. In other words, how many distinct ways can the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z add up to 3? Because n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

So I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. That's a combinatorial problem. The number of solutions is given by the combination formula C(n + k -1, k -1), where n is the total and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3 and k=3, so C(3 + 3 -1, 3-1) = C(5,2) which is 10. Oh, right, because it's like "stars and bars" — the number of ways to distribute 3 identical items into 3 distinct boxes, allowing zeros.

Wait, but each function is different based on the arrangement of n_x, n_y, n_z. So, for example, (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) are three different functions, each corresponding to different permutations. Similarly, (2,1,0) and its permutations are another set. Let me count them.

Case 1: All three in one direction. So, three possibilities: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). That's 3 eigenfunctions.

Case 2: Two in one direction, one in another. This would be like (2,1,0). How many permutations are there? Well, the positions of 2,1,0 can be arranged in 3! =6 ways. Wait, but wait, the numbers must be non-negative and sum to 3. So for each unique permutation, the functions are different. So 6 functions in this case.

Case 3: All three directions have 1 each: (1,1,1). Only 1 way, since all are same. So 1 function.

Wait, but 3 (from case 1) + 6 (case 2) + 1 (case3) gives 10 functions. So that's correct.

So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says energy is (9/2) ħω and number is 10. That matches. So option A is the correct choice.

Now, let me check the other options to make sure.

Option B: The energy is 11 π² ħ²/(2m r²). That looks like an expression from a different potential, perhaps Coulomb or something with 1/r. Not relevant here. So B is out.

Option C: Energy is (9/2) ħω but number is 3. But we found the number is 10, so C is wrong.

Option D: Same energy as B, and number 3. So also incorrect.

So yeah, the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which correspond to the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator states in the \( x, y, z \) directions. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state (\( n = 3 \)) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem solved using the "stars and bars" method, which gives:

\[
\text{Number of solutions} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct, as it states the energy is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and the number of eigenfunctions is 10.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the energy expression does not match the harmonic oscillator potential.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it states the number of eigenfunctions is 3, which is wrong.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the energy expression is incorrect, and the number of eigenfunctions is also wrong.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
