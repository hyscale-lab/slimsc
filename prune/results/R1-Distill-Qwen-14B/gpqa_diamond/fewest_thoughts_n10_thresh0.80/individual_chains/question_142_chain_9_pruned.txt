Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it involves density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: Consider the density matrix ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). What is its geometrical position in the qubits space? The options are A to D with different r vectors.

Wait, I remember that a density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (i.e., a statistical mixture of pure states) rather than pure. So, if I have a density matrix, how do I find its position in the qubit space?

I think qubit states are two-dimensional, so the space is represented in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where a pure state is a point on the surface, and a mixed state would be inside the sphere.

But wait, what's the geometric position here? Oh right, the density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere, using something called the Bloch vector. The Bloch vector has components (x,y,z) that correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

So, for a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute that. Let's expand |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. 

|0⟩⟨0| is a matrix that's 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the bottom-right corner. So adding these gives a diagonal matrix with both entries 1, and then multiplied by 1/2, so ρ becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, this is the completely mixed state for a qubit. Because it's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, so it's the maximally mixed state. That makes sense because the diagonal is all 1/2, and the off-diagonals are 0.

Now, how does this relate to the Bloch vector. Let's think about the general form again. The density matrix can be written as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So:

ρ = (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2

We can compute each component. Let's compute each Pauli matrix.

Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]
Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pauli Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the given ρ is:

(1/2)[ [1,0], [0,1] ] = (I)/2.

So, setting (I + r·σ)/2 equal to ρ, which is (I)/2, we get:

(I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 → I + r·σ = I → r·σ = 0.

Which implies that each component r_x, r_y, r_z must be zero. Because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices, each term contributes to the off-diagonal elements.

Wait, let me think again. Let's compute each term:

r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

The matrix would be:

[ r_z, r_x - i r_y ]
[ r_x + i
