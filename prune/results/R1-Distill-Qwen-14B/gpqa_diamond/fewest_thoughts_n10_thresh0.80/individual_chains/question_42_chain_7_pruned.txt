Alright, let's try to figure this out. Hmm, okay, so the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. The key here is to relate the given information to the orbital period using some physics principles I remember.

So, the problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets. Planet1 and Planet2 have a ratio of 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. All planets have the same albedo, which is 0.3. I need to find how much larger Planet3's orbital period is compared to Planet1.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet relates to its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is T = [(L (1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, and D is the distance. Since all albedos are the same, a is 0.3 for all.

So the equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance D. Because T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4), which is same as (L)^(1/4) * D^(-1/2). So if T1 is the temperature for Planet1, T2 for Planet2, etc., then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt(D2/D1).

Wait, let's think again. If T is proportional to (1/sqrt(D)), then T1/T2 = (D2 / D1)^(1/2). Because T is inversely proportional, so T1 = k * (1/sqrt(D1)), T2 = k * (1/sqrt(D2)).

So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So for Planet1 and Planet2, their temperature ratio is 1.4. So 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides, (1.4)^2 = (D2/D1). That's about 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring gives D3/D2 = (2.3)^2. Let me calculate that: 2.3 * 2.3 is 5.29. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

But D2 is already 1.96 * D1, so D3 =5.29 *1.96 * D1. Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 *2 is 10, but wait, let me calculate
