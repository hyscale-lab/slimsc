Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is propene because the molecular formula for propene is C3H6. Propene is an alkene, right? So the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. I think that's a typical bromination of an alkene, probably via an addition reaction. So Compound A, propene, reacts with bromine (probably Br2) in CCl4 to form Compound B. When alkenes react with bromine, they usually add across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add Br2 to become 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br across the double bond would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, and I think it's used for elimination reactions. Since B is a dibromide, when you treat it with a strong base, it likely undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but since there are two bromines adjacent (vicinal dihalide), reacting with a base would lead to elimination of HBr twice, forming an alkene again. So the product C would be an alkene. Let me think: the structure of B is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two Br- groups, forming a double bond. The possible products are probably 1-propene or maybe 2-propene, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. But wait, if we eliminate from the central carbon, perhaps it forms the same propene again? Or maybe another isomer. Hmm, maybe it's 2-propene, but that's not possible because propene has the double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting alkene is propene, which has the double bond between C1 and C2 (CH2=CHCH3). When bromine adds across the double bond, it adds to the two double-bond carbons, so you get 1,2-dibrom
