Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what I can understand.

The problem describes a series of reactions and observations. Let's break it down.

First, there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So mixture X has two liquids, each with unsaturated bonds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. The formation note says it's a result of disproportionation. Disproportionation reactions involve a single species being both oxidized and reduced. For example, maybe something like the oxidation state of a carbon changes in different parts of the molecule. Also, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, meaning the products have no double bonds or triple bonds. So whatever reaction happened, it saturated any unsaturated bonds.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Also, Z is a constituent of Y. Oh, and Z is widely used as a solvent. Hmm, common solvents are like alkanes or maybe some ethers, but since Z is a hydrocarbon, maybe an alkane.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is 1/7. Let me calculate the molecular formula. Let's assume the molecular weight is M. So (mass of H)/M = 0.1428. Hydrocarbons have H atoms as 2n+2 for alkanes, or maybe 2n for something else if unsaturated, but since Z comes from hydrogenation, it's definitely saturated.

Wait, but Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So it's a saturated hydrocarbon. So probably an alkane.

Let's find the molecular formula. Let me think. Let's say the compound is CnH2n+2. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2)/(12n + 2) ) = 0.1428.

So:

(2n + 2) / (12n + 2) = 1/7 (since 14.28% is approximately 1/7, 0.142857).

Multiply both sides by (12n + 2):

2n + 2 = (12n + 2)/7

Multiply both sides by 7:

14n + 14 = 12n + 2

Subtract 12n:

2n +14 = 2

Subtract 14:

2n = -12

Wait, that can't be right. Negative n? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the steps.

Wait, 14n +14 = 12n +2.

Subtract 12n: 2n +14 = 2.

Subtract 14: 2n = -12 → n= -6. That's impossible. So something's wrong.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, let me recalculate the mass fraction.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is 14.28% which is 1/7.

So (mass H) / (mass of molecule) ) = 1/7.

Hydrogen has an atomic mass of 1, and carbon is 12. Let's assume the formula is CnHm.

So mass H is m *1. Mass of molecule is 12n + m.

So (m)/(12n + m) )=1/7.

Cross-multiplying: 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So m=2n.

Since Z is a hydrocarbon from hydrogenation, which adds H2. So the starting material must have been unsaturated. But since Z is the product, it's fully saturated. So for alkanes, m=2n+2.

Wait, but according to the calculation, m=2n, which is for an alkene? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's recast it.

Wait, Z is a hydrocarbon, and from the hydrogenation of Y. Y doesn't have any double bonds because it doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y is a mixture of alkanes or something else without double bonds.

Wait, but mixture Y comes from the disproportionation of X, which had two liquids that decolorize bromine. So X has two alkenes or other unsaturated compounds. Then upon treatment with Pt and heat, they undergo a reaction—disproportionation—leading to Y, which has no double bonds.

So, when X is hydrogenated, you get Z, which is a single product. Similarly, Y when hydrogenated under severe conditions also gives Z. So X and Y must have the same hydrogenation product, implying that X and Y are the same in terms of hydrogenation, but perhaps differ in other ways.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two unsaturated compounds, Y is a mixture of two other compounds without unsaturation. When X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is one substance. So each component of X upon hydrogenation gives Z. So each component in X must be such that when hydrogenated, they both form Z. Only possible if both components are same but in a way that hydrogenation leads to same product. But that's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps X consists of two dienes or something else that upon hydrogenation gives the same alkane Z.

Alternatively, perhaps X has two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give the same alkane. For example, maybe X has two different alkenes that have the
