Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second is 3m and moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, wait. The question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. Oh right, because they're moving at different speeds, their relative speed isn't just the difference in their velocities. I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like in classical mechanics. You have to use the velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So, I should plug in the two velocities here. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. Wait, but wait—since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the second from the first's perspective would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused about who's the observer. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, then from A's frame, what's B's speed? So u is 0.5c (B's speed in the lab frame), and v is 0.6c (A's speed in the lab frame), right? Because from A's perspective, the lab is moving at -0.6c.

So applying the formula: (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²) where u is B's velocity and v is the velocity of A's frame relative to the lab, which is 0.6c. So substituting, (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0
