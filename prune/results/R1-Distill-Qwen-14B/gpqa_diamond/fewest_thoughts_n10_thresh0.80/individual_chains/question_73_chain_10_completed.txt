Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, especially velocities, I can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics because of the relativity of velocities. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory.

Wait, wait, the relative speed here is how fast one astronaut sees the other moving. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, from A's frame, B's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or is it the other way around? Let me make sure. Yeah, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, A sees B moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator first: 0.5c - 0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator: (0.6 * 0.5)c² /c² is 0.3, so 1 - 0.3 is 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since the question asks for speed, it's 0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the total energy of the system. I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut and then add them. Remember, relativistic energy E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. Let's compute gamma. v²/c² is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma here: (0.5)^2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says 5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D says same speed but E=5 mc². So the correct choice must be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate the energies correctly? Let me double-check. For the first astronaut: 2m * gamma. Gamma was 1.25. 2*1.25=2.5. That's right. For the second: 3m * gamma, which was about 1.1547. 3*1.1547 is approximately 3.464, yes. Sum is 5.964, which rounds to 5.96. So option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So that's the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{vu}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v = 0.5c\) (velocity of the second astronaut) and \(u = 0.6c\) (velocity of the first astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but since the question asks for speed, we take the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2\).

These values match **Option C**.
