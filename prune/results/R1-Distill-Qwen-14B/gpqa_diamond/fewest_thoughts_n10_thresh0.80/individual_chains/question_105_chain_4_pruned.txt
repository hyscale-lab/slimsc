Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the scenario is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem says this can look like an exoplanet transit, so they're asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation.

Wait, okay, so the question is about the amplitude of the light curve. The star's spots cause the same variation as a planet blocking some light. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip in brightness when the planet transits is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Let me think about how the brightness variation works in both cases. For a planet transit, the dip is due to the planet blocking a part of the star's light. The area of the planet relative to the star determines this dip. The formula I remember is the fractional decrease in brightness, ΔF, is approximately (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because the area of a circle is πR², and when you block that area, the change is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But wait, in the case of the star spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, so when they are facing us, they make the star appear a bit dimmer. The variation in brightness is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. So the amplitude of the brightness change would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference relative to the star.

So first, let's figure out the brightness variation due to the spots. The star's effective temperature is Teff = 6000 K, and the spots are T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. If the star's radius is same as Sun, Rstar = R_sun, but since in the end we're taking a ratio, maybe Rstar cancels out.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots when the hemisphere is facing us is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. But wait, a hemisphere has an area of (1/2) * 4πR² = 2πR². So the total spotty area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but when the star rotates, only a part of the hemisphere is visible. But the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty, so perhaps when the star is viewed from Earth, the entire hemisphere's spots are either visible or not as the star rotates. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Actually, the star is a sphere, so when it rotates, we can see up
