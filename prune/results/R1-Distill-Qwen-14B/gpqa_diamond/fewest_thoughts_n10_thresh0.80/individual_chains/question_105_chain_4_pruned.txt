Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. When we observe this star, its brightness variations due to rotation would look a bit like the dip caused by an exoplanet passing in front, but it's actually from the spots.

The question is, to get the same brightness variation (amplitude) as if a planet were transiting, what would the planet's radius have to be relative to the star? So, we're comparing the light curve amplitude caused by the star's spots to that of a planet transit.

Hmm. I remember that the change in brightness during a transit depends on the area of the object blocking the light. For a planet, the depth of the transit is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because area scales with radius squared.

But wait, the star's spots are a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer than when the hotter parts are facing. So the variation in brightness comes from the rotation of the star, which brings the spotted hemisphere into and out of view.

I think the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness caused by the spots and compare it to the change caused by a planet.

So, let's break it down.

First, the star's total brightness without spots. The flux from the star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. Since we're dealing with relative changes, maybe I can consider the brightness in terms of the area and temperature.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So, the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR² / 2) = 0.2πR²? Wait, because a hemisphere is 2πR², but each spot is on one hemisphere, so the area of the hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (πR²) for each hemisphere, but wait, no: the hemisphere's area is 2πR², but each spot is on one hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R²? Or wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that is spots. So if the hemisphere is area 2π R², the spots cover 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait, the star emits light from both hemispheres, but when the star rotates, one hemisphere comes into view, then the other. But in this case, only one
