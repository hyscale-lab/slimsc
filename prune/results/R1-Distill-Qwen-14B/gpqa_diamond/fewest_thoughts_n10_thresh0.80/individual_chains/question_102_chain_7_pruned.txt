Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

Okay, so the question is about a genetic construct and why a green signal isn't observed in the mice. Let me start by understanding the setup.

The researchers are working with a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors have two coding sequences, right? So here, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. I think IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is expressed in a different way. 

Looking at the stop cassettes: between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, I remember that loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. Cre recombinase can only cut loxP sites when both are present, but if a site is lox2272, maybe it's a different arrangement. 

Then, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. On Western blot, they see signals proportional to actin, so that's a loading control.

The mice are homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, I think. SOX10-Cre would activate the construct in neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal microscope. They're looking for green, which would come from eGFP. But they don't see it. Why?

The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect expression? The question is about why eGFP isn't expressed. So maybe the ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere. But the problem is that the eGFP is linked to the receptor. If the ligand is in paracrine, it might not affect the expression. Hmm, not sure if this is the reason.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, maybe it doesn't get to the cell surface. But then the Western blot would show the protein, just not in the right place. But the question says they used the antibodies on Western blot and got signals proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed. So if the eGFP is expressed but just not trafficked, the Western should show the band. But in the mice, they're looking for fluorescence. So if it's stuck in the Golgi, the eGFP wouldn't be on the surface, so no fluorescence. But would the Western detect it? Maybe yes, because the protein is present, just retained. But then why no signal in the blot? The question doesn't specify that the blot didn't show the receptor. So perhaps this isn't the issue.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the construct has promoters, the CBA for the ligand, and IRES for the receptor. So enhancers are usually regions that help increase transcription. If the enhancer is missing, the expression might be lower. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The IRES is a way to have two proteins expressed from the same transcript, but without a strong enhancer
