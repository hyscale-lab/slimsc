Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how much light a planet absorbs from its star. Let's try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 times that of the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets have their own masses and radii. But I'm more interested in their equilibrium temperatures here.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula... I think it's something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Oh right, because the planet reflects some light (albedo), so the absorbed energy is (1 - albedo) times the incident.

But the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that (1 - albedo) factor would cancel out when taking the ratio. So maybe I don't need to worry about that part for the temperature ratio.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. Since A is the same for both, the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because the R and star terms would cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, wait. Let me get that ratio right. The formula for each planet's T_eq is:

T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) * ( (1-A) )^0.25

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) * ( (1-A) )^0.25

So when we take T1 / T2, the T_star and (1-A) terms cancel. So it becomes sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) . The R_star and 2 cancel, so sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1).

But wait another thing: we need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So it
