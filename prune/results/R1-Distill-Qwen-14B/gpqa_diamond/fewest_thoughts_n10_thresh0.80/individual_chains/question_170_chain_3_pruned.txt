Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome if you measured an observable many times on a system in a particular state. Right, and spin is one of those observables.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means a two-component spinor. So the state vector is probably written as a column vector with components 3i and 4. Let me write that out: ψ = [3i, 4]^T, I guess. Or wait, maybe it's a row vector? No, I think in quantum mechanics the state vectors are column vectors, so ψ = (3i, 4) would be a column with those two elements. Oh, but wait, sometimes people might write it as a row when it's a row vector, but in this case, the problem probably represents it as a column vector.

The expectation value of S_y would be the expectation value of the spin operator S_y. I remember that the spin operators for an electron are given in terms of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, and S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z.

So, σ_y is given as the matrix:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

To find the expectation value, I need to compute <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. Oh right, because the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the operator, multiplied by the state.

So first, I need to write down ψ. Let me get that right. ψ is (3i, 4) as a column vector. So ψ is:

[3i]
[4 ]

Wait no, wait: the problem says (3i, 4). So the first component is 3i, the second is 4. So yes, that's correct.

So the conjugate transpose (ψ†) would be a row vector with the complex conjugate of each element. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† is a 1x2 matrix, and S_y is 2x
