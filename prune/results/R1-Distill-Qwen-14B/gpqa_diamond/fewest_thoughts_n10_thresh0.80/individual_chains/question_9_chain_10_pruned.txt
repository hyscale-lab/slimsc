Okay, so I've got this question about molecules and their symmetry, specifically which one has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography and molecular symmetry, so I need to think this through.

First, what's C3h symmetry? I remember that symmetry groups are named based on their elements. The C3h point group is one of the axial groups. C3 means there's a three-fold rotation axis, and the h indicates a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, wait. I think I might have that mixed up. Oh right, for the point groups, the notation can be a bit tricky. The C3h group has a principal three-fold axis (C3), and also a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis (like a sigma h plane). Or wait, no, maybe the h in C3h refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So, the C3 axis is the main one, and the mirror plane is horizontal. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of rotation and reflection.

Wait, another approach: think about the elements in C3h. The group includes a C3 rotation and a σh mirror plane. So, the molecule must have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis. Or wait, maybe the mirror plane is in a certain orientation. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. Oh right, the C3h group is part of the axial groups. The principal axis is C3, and there's also a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation symmetry and a mirror plane that's horizontal relative to the principal axis.

Now, looking at the options, the molecules are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I think quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule. Its structure is like a bridge, maybe with three rings? Or wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, specifically a tricyclic? No, wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, like a norbornane derivative. Norbornane has two bridgeheads and a six-membered ring. Quinuclidine has a similar structure but with a bridge over two carbons. I think it's a bicyclic structure with a bridge, perhaps giving it some symmetry. But what about its symmetry group?

Triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO, which has a boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. The molecule would have a trigonal planar geometry around boron. Each isopropyl group is a three-carbon branch. So the structure is symmetric because all three substituents are identical. So the molecule should have a high degree of symmetry. If each isopropyl group is arranged symmetrically around boron, the molecule would have a C3 axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Hmm, in a trigonal planar structure, there are three mirror planes each containing the C3 axis and a pair of atoms. Wait, no. Wait, trigonal planar has a C3 axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it. But for triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is a substituent. So the molecule would have a C3 symmetry because rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But does it have a mirror plane? For C3h, we need a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. Wait, I'm not entirely sure whether triisopropyl borate has a mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps it's in the C3v group, which has a vertical mirror plane.

Wait
