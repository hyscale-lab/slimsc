Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'll probably need to figure out what each compound is and then see which option matches compound E.

The question gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form E. There are also some hints provided, so I should definitely pay attention to those.

First, let me outline the steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

And the hints:

a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. The IR of E is around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower frequency than a typical ketone. Maybe it's an aldehyde or another carbonyl?

So, let's start with the first reaction: A + HCN → B. HCN is a nucleophile and typically adds to carbonyl groups in a nucleophilic addition. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would add the CN- to the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Wait, but another possibility is that A might be an aldehyde, but the IR of A is 1750, which is more consistent with a ketone than an aldehyde because aldehydes have higher carbonyl peaks around 1720 or so, but wait, maybe it's a conjugated ketone?

Wait, but 1750 is a bit high for a regular ketone. Esters are around 1740-1710, maybe. Wait, no, actually, ketones typically absorb around 1715 cm^-1. Hmm, but wait, some sources say that esters are higher, around 1740. So if A is a ketone, why is the peak at 1750? Or maybe it's an aldehyde or something else. Hmm, maybe A is an ester. Wait, but aldehyde would have a peak around 2820 (stretch) and a strong peak around 1720. Alternatively, maybe the 1750 is a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone in a ring or with electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, moving on. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin. So A would have a structure R-CO-R', and adding HCN would form R-C(OH)(CN)-R'. Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the reduction might target the carbonyl group. Wait, but the product of the addition of HCN is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. So in B, there's an alcohol and a nitrile group.

Wait, but when you hydrogenate a nitrile, you typically get an amine. Wait, no, wait: Hydrogenation of nitriles under H2 and Pd would reduce the nitrile to an amine. Wait, but another possibility is that under certain conditions, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but in the presence of Pd, perhaps it's a hydrogenation of double bonds or another functional group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The reaction steps:

A → B: HCN addition.

B → C: H2, Pd. So that's a hydrogenation step. What would be in B that would be hydrogenated?

If B is a cyanohydrin (so R-C(OH)(CN)-R'), then C would be the product after hydrogenation. But wait, the OH and CN groups: hydrogenation might affect the double bond if any, but in a cyanohydrin, is there a double bond?

Wait, no. The cyanohydrin itself doesn't have a double bond; it's a single bond. So perhaps the hydrogenation affects another part. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile group in B is being hydrogenated. Let me think: nitriles (RCN) on hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd might be reduced to amines (RCH2NH2?), but that would require more specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is hydrogenolysis, like removing the nitrile as CN- and adding H2 to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Let me think of the overall process.

Wait, maybe A is a cycloketone, like a cyclic ketone. Because the hint a) says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms a certain structure. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, which converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes.

So if A is a ketone, and reacting with a phosphorous ylide would form an alkene via the Wittig reaction. For example, cyclohexanone reacting with a ylide would give cyclohexene.

In the given hint, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me parse that structure. So it's a cyclopentane ring. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. Then at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= group? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH2?) No, wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)-, but as a substituent. So the substituent is a vinylic group, a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or more accurately, the substituent is a propenyl group attached via the central carbon.

Wait, the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent is –CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? Or is the substituent a double bond connected to the cyclopentane?

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclopentane ring with substituents
