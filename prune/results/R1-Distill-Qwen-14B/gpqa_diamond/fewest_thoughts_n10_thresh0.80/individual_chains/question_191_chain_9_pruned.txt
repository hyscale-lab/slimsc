Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a multi-step synthesis, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize this structure. So, the cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group—so that's a CH2OH attached. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2?) or wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is attached to carbon 2. So, the structure is CH2-C(CH2?), wait no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH–CH3 attached via the middle carbon. So, that would be an isopropenyl group. So, position 5 is attached to an isopropenyl group, which is CH2–C(CH2?) or wait, maybe it's CH2–CH2–CH3? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2– attached via the CH2? No, I think it's CH2=C(CH2–) something. Wait, maybe it's better to write it as CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2–, but that's propenyl. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2–CH–, with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the group is CH2–C(=CH2)–R? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl, which is CH2=C(CH3)-. So, the substituent is CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the cyclohexanone ring.

So, the
