Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the reaction product's NMR data. Hmm, okay, let's see.

First, let's read what's given. Compound X has the formula C11H12O. It undergoes a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Oh wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used as a catalyst in certain reactions. Oh right! It's used in the Staudinger reaction, but wait, maybe in epoxide ring-opening reactions too? Or perhaps it's involved in some elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a cyclic amine and a base. If the reaction is at high temperature (403 K is about 130°C), maybe it's an acid-catalyzed reaction? Or maybe an elimination, like an E2 mechanism?

But wait, the product's NMR data is given. So the product isn't X itself. So X reacts under these conditions to form a new compound. But wait, the question is to identify X. So we need to look at the product's structure based on NMR and then figure out what X could be.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets of 3H each. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Like maybe attached to carbonyl groups or aromatic rings in a way that symmetry makes them singlets.

The aromatic region: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). Wait, that seems a bit complex. Maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with some substituents. The doublets suggest coupling with adjacent protons. Let's think about coupling patterns. Maybe this is a para-substituted structure with some substituents.

Wait, the 13C NMR has data too. Let's check that:

13C NMR: 21.3 (s, 1C), 28.4 (s, 1C), 126.9 (s, 2C), 127.1 (s, 1C), 129.1 (s, 2C), 130.3 (s, 1C), 141.5 (s, 1C), 144.1 (s, 1C), 197.7 (s, 1C).

Hmm,
