Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, and the coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 is 1, l2 is 1, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So, I need to find the probability that both electrons have their orbital angular momentum in the -ħ state.

Hmm, okay. I remember that orbital angular momentum states are labeled by quantum numbers l and m. For a single electron in a p orbital, l=1, so the possible m values are -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron has l=1. The total angular momentum l is 2, and m is -1.

I think the coupled state is a combination of the product states of each individual state. Each electron's state is |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>, and the coupled state is a sum over all possible combinations that add up to total l and m.

But wait, the state given is already the coupled state. So, to find the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ, I need to find the coefficients in the expansion of the coupled state in terms of the product states of each electron's individual states.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each electron has its own angular momentum state. The coupled state is the total angular momentum state, which is a combination of the product states. So, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = m_total = -1.

So, in this case, each product state has m1
