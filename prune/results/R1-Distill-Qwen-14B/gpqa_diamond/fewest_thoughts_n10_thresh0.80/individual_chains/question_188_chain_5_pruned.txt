Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but the angles can be different. Wait, no, in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. Oh right, because the question says α=β=γ=30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with all angles 30°, and the interatomic distance is 10 Å.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think interplanar distance refers to the d-spacing, which is calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)(cos α + cos β + cos γ) + ... wait, wait, maybe I should recall the correct formula for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, another approach. I remember that for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a√(h² +k² + l²). But rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles are not 90 degrees. Oh right, for a general crystal system, the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ) ), but wait, no, that's maybe for a hexagonal system or something else.

Wait, no, perhaps for rhombohedral, since all a, b, c
