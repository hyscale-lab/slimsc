Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which I remember is part of solid-state chemistry or materials science. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I need to recall what a rhombohedral crystal structure is. From what I remember, a rhombohedron is a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So in this problem, the angles alpha, beta, and gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, wait. I think in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, so it's a special case of the hexagonal or cubic systems, but maybe it's a separate category. Or perhaps it's a type of orthorhombic system where the angles are all equal. Wait, no, the rhombohedral system has a, b, c all equal, and all angles equal too. So it's a kind of cubic distortion, but the angles are 30 degrees here, not 90, so it's definitely rhombohedral.

The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom. Wait, but wait, wait. Interatomic distance in which context? Oh, I think in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell edges are a, and that's the interatomic distance if it's a simple cubic structure. But wait, waitâ€”rhombohedral is more complex than that. Oh, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a? Or is it something else? Hmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that a is given as 10 Angstrom since it's the interatomic distance. Or does interatomic distance refer to the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice? For a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the edge length a. So, let's say a = 10 Angstrom here.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance, which I think is often denoted as d_hkl, where hkl are the Miller indices. The formula for calculating d_hkl is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the lattice parameters multiplied by the Miller indices squared. Or more accurately, the
