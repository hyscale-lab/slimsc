Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, I remember that when dealing with particle decays, the lifetime observed isn't the same as the proper lifetime because of time dilation. So the proper lifetime τ₀ is measured in the particle's rest frame, but when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is longer due to special relativity. The formula for the observed lifetime τ should be τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But how do I find gamma? Oh right, gamma is the total energy of the particle divided by its rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m. The energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma should be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 8 is about 27.28, so maybe around 8. So gamma is approximately 8.

So τ = 8 * 8e-16 s. Wait, wait, no. The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s, so τ = 8 * 8e-16 s? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that correctly. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 3.41 times 8 is 27.28. So 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's say approximately 7.91. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Wait, no, τ is gamma multiplied by tau0. So yeah, 7.91 * 8e-16 s.

Wait, 7.91 * 8 is 63.28. So 63.28e-16 s. Which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

But wait, why do I need the lifetime? Because the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe the decays. Oh right, the resolution relates to the length over which the decay products can be detected. Decays that happen over a longer time (or longer path) would be harder to detect because the particles have more time to move, but the detector has limited resolution.

The minimum resolution required relates to the maximum length over which the decay can occur. The longer the lifetime (from time dilation), the longer the decay path, so the higher the resolution (smaller the minimum detectable length) needed to capture the decay.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem is that the detector's resolution must be good enough to see the decay. The minimum resolution needed is the maximum length the decay products can travel before the chamber can't resolve them anymore. So we want that the decay occurs within the detector's resolution, so that we can see the vertex, or at least some information about where the decay happened.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think it has to do with the particles' velocity and the time they live as seen in the lab frame. The particles will travel a certain distance before decaying, and the detector must be able to resolve that distance.

So, the idea is that the proper lifetime is tau0, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. The particles will move a certain distance before decaying. The distance L is given by L = v * tau * c, where v is the velocity. But wait, perhaps it's easier to relate using the mean lifetime and the velocity.

Wait, let's think in terms of the mean path length. The mean path is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. But, wait, the decay probability in a time t is 1 - exp(-t/tau). So the probability that a decay occurs within a certain time is given by that function.

Wait, but the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, what's the minimum resolution needed so that the detector can capture 30% of the decays. Hmm, perhaps the way
