Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But each has different capabilities. The question mentions that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter means lower magnitude numbers, right? So anything with V mag less than or equal to 17 would be observable. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the star's apparent V magnitude needs to be less than or equal to 16.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Brighter means lower magnitude. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17. HIRES can see stars up to V=16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16. Because if it's 17, HIRES can't see it. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, ESPRESSO observes stars brighter than 17 mag. So any star with V ≤17, because brighter magnitudes are smaller numbers. So any star that's brighter (has a lower magnitude) than 17. So ESPRESSO can see down to 17. HIRES can see up to 16, meaning it can see stars brighter than 16 mag. So the fainter limit for HIRES is 16. So to be observed by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16 because that's the lower limit (brighter) for both.

Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can see up to V=17. So a star with V=17 is the faintest it can observe. HIRES can only see up to V=16. So any star that's brighter than 16 (i.e., V ≤16) would be observable by both. Because if a star is V=15, both can see it. If a star is V=16, HIRES can see it, but ESPRESSO can't? Or wait, let me think again.

Wait the question states: For ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star is brighter (V mag <17), it's observable. So the limit is V <17. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed, so V <16.

So a star must have V <16 to be observed by both. Because if it's V=16, HIRES can't see it (as it's equal to 16, but the condition is brighter than 16, which is V<16). Wait, wait the way it's written may be a point of confusion. Let me recheck the question.

Question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So V <17. Similarly, with HIRES
