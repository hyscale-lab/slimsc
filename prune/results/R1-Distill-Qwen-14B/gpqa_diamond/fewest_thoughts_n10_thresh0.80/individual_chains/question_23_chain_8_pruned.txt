Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and found the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots. The options are A to D, each giving possible product structures. I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break that down. The butenyl group is four carbons, with a double bond starting at position 3. So the structure would be:

O
||
O—C6H4—CH2—C(CH3)2—CH2— 

Wait, no. Wait, wait. No. Let me think again. The group is but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. But wait, butane is four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond in the wrong place. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-.

Wait no, wait. The numbering starts from the end that's connected to the oxygen. So the en-1-yl group: the double bond starts at position 1? No, that can't be. Wait, but the position is given as but-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is the butenyl group, which is four carbons in total. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So structure would be: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be because butane is four carbons, so the positions must be adjusted. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3? Because but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but the double bond is at position 3, but that's the third carbon which would be the end. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about but-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, the butenyl group is four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4? But since it's but-3-en-1-yl, the substituent is on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, wait, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-? No, because but-3-en-1
