Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that's N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect parallax to distance and then see how the number of stars changes with distance.

Wait, right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I recall is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh yeah, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d. That means that distance d = 1/plx.

So if I have N varying with 1/plx^5, I can substitute plx from the distance formula. Let's do that. Rewriting N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, but since plx is 1/d, that would be 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Let me compute that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as (d)^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so taking reciprocal gives d^5.

Wait, wait, no. Wait a second. Let me think again. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Hmm. So when they say "per unit range of distance, r", they're probably referring to the number density or the number of stars per unit volume or per unit distance?

Wait, no, I think I might have that wrong. Let me read the question again. "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmm. Oh, maybe it's the number per unit distance as you go further out. Because parallax is higher (smaller distance) and
