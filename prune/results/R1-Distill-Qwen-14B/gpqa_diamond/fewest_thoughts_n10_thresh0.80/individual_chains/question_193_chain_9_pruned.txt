Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over the parallax to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, each giving a different dependence on r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Wait, wait, no, that's not exactly right. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r. So if r increases, plx decreases. Got it.

The problem says the number of stars (n) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: n ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, we have n ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as r^5. So n is proportional to r^5? That would make n ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait. Wait, wait a second. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So n = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So n = k * r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5? That seems really steep, but okay.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think we're being asked about the differential change, like the number of stars per unit distance. Or maybe it's about the change in number with distance. Hmm. Let me clarify.

The question is: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)? So maybe it's the change in number with respect to r. So perhaps it's looking for dn/dr, the derivative.

Right,
