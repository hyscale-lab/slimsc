Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? So, it's about chirality—whether the molecule has a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry that leads to enantiomers.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to count how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no—1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double-bonded to the second. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH3? Or wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but for a double bond, is there any possibility of geometric isomerism here? Oh, but the question is about optical activity, which is about chirality, not about whether it has cis/trans isomerism. Chirality requires a tetrahedral center with four different groups. So in (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH3? Or maybe I got the structure wrong.

Wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH2CH3, but I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl attached to a double bond. Wait, maybe it's (Z)-configuration means that the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged in a particular way.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. The compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and is attached to another CH2 group. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=
