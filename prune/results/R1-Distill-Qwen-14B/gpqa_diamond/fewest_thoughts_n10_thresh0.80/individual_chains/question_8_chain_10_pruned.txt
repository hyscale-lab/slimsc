Okay, let's see. I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding their resistance to anthracnose. Hmm, so I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each and some double mutants. The goal was to find which genes contribute to resistance. The results are given as the resistance percentage compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%. 

Let me jot down the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less than wild type but not completely susceptible. Maybe a partial loss of function? Since 75 is three-quarters, so the plant is still somewhat resistant. It's not zero, so the gene isn't completely necessary.

- g2: 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So the mutant plants can't resist anthracnose at all. That suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Maybe it's a transcription factor since it's acting upstream.

- g3: 50% resistance. So, halfway between wild type and susceptible. Hmm, so the function of G3 is also important but less so than G2? Or maybe it's involved in a different pathway.

Now the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's really low. Lower than either g1 or g3 alone. So combining the two knockouts makes things worse. 

- g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. That's interesting because when you have g2 already at 0, adding g3 doesn't change it. So maybe G2 is upstream of G3, or they function in the same pathway. Since g2 is 0, perhaps G2 is required for G3's function. Or G3 doesn't add anything when G2 is already knocked out.

- g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is gone. But wait, g2 alone is already 0. So what's the effect of knocking out G1 in a plant that's already G2-deficient? It still can't resist. Hmm. Maybe G1 and G2 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Since g2 is 0, and g1g2 is also 0, perhaps G1 normally contributes to resistance in a way that's only apparent when G2 is present. Or maybe G1 is downstream of G2. Hmm.

But the question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of another. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor. Because if G2 is a TF, its knockout would lead to a severe phenotype, which is what we see (0%). 

Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D all have G2 as the transcription factor. So that makes sense. Because if G2 is a TF, then knocking it out would disable the transcription of downstream genes, leading to lower resistance.

Let me think about what each option says.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor. But wait, the data shows that G2 is the TF because its knockout is most severe. So option A is unlikely.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Wait, same promoter? I'm not sure what that implies. If they have the same promoter, maybe they are co-regulated? Not sure. Also, the double mutants: g1g3 is 10%. Hmm, not sure how that fits.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy means a single gene affecting multiple traits. Not sure if that's the case here. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single. So their effects are additive? Or maybe they function in the same pathway. But I don't see how that's pleiotropy.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Redundancy would mean that either gene can compensate for the other. So knocking both out would have a worse effect than either alone. Which is what we see in g1g3 (10% which is lower than 75 and 50). So that fits. Also, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene masks the effect of another. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean G1 acts downstream of G3. Because in epistasis, the downstream gene is epistatic
