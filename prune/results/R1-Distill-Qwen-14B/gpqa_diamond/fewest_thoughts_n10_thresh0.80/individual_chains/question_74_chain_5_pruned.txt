Okay, so I'm trying to solve this decay probability problem. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about the decay of a single atom, and we're given some probabilities. Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and this is independent of the time that has already passed.

The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance the atom has decayed. That means the probability of it not decaying (the remaining) is 68% after 100 minutes. 

Now, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait. So, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Hmm, but I think the way to approach this is to consider the decay probabilities in each time interval.

Wait, but the decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So even though 50 minutes have gone by without decay, the probability for the next 150 minutes is calculated as if it's starting fresh.

Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, the initial probability given is for 100 minutes. So perhaps I need to model the decay constant first
