Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction scheme involving several compounds. The task is to identify compound E. Let me break down the steps given.

First, compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Hmm. Also, there are some hints provided. Let me look at those.

Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. I remember that ylides are often used in Wittig reactions. So, the Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting ylides with aldehydes or ketones. So, compound A must be a ketone or aldehyde because the Wittig reaction requires that.

The product of the Wittig reaction in hint a is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to draw that structure mentally. It's a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The propan-2-ylidene group is like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the ring. The positions are 1 and 2 on the ring, meaning two methyl groups are attached at adjacent positions, and the ylidene group is at position 4.

Wait, so the starting material A would be reacting with the ylide to form that. So, the ylide has a CH2-C(CH3)- part, and when it reacts with A (a carbonyl), it would form the alkene.

So, perhaps A is a cyclopentanone with some substituents. Let me think: if the ylide adds to the carbonyl, forming an alkene, the position of the carbonyl in A would correspond to where the ylidene group ends up.

So, for example, if A is 2,3-dimethylcyclopentanone, then adding the ylide (which would have a CH2-C(CH3)-...) would form an alkene. Wait, but in the product, the ylidene is at position 4. So perhaps the carbonyl in A is at position 4, and the adjacent positions have methyl groups.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the ring has methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2. The substituent is on carbon 4.

So the starting compound A must have a carbonyl at position 4, and maybe a methyl at positions 1 and 2. Or maybe another possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a cyclopentanone with substituents such that when the ylide adds, the double bond ends up at position 4. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think for now, I'll note that A is a cyclopentanone derivative.

Now, hint b says the IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's typical for a carbonyl group (C=O), so that aligns with A being a ketone or aldehyde. Also, the IR of E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower than 1750. So, that's also a carbonyl, possibly a ketone or maybe an aldehyde, but maybe a conjugated carbonyl or something else, like a cyclic ketone.

Let me think about the reaction steps again.

Step 1: A reacts with HCN to give B. HCN is typically a nucleophile. So, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, yes, cyanohydrins are formed when ketones react with HCN in presence of acid, adding a hydroxyl and a cyanide group.

So, A is a ketone, and B is a cyanohydrin. Then, step two: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. H2 and Pd are catalysts for hydrogenation. So, what gets hydrogenated here? The cyanide group is -CN. When hydrogenated, that would become -CH2NH2, but wait, no, H2 with Pd would reduce the nitrile. Wait, nitriles (CN) upon hydrogenation typically become amines (-CH2NH2?), but under certain conditions, maybe a ketone? No, wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but perhaps in this case, the reduction is of the nitrile to an amine. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is of another functional group. Let me think again.

Wait, compound B is the cyanohydrin, which would have both an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon as the original carbonyl. So, during the hydrogenation step, perhaps both the nitrile and the hydroxyl group are involved. Wait, but H2 and Pd are more likely to hydrogenate triple bonds or nitriles. So, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to CH2NH2? Or maybe to an amine group.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyanohydrin is reduced to form a secondary alcohol. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what each step does.

The cyanohydrin has the structure R2C(OH)CN. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin adds HCN to a ketone. The general reaction is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. So, the structure would be R2C(OH)CN. So, for example, if A is cyclopentanone, then B would be 1-hydroxycyclopentyl cyanide, but that's probably not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the product of a ketone reacting with HCN, like acetone reacting with HCN, would form a cyanohydrin, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, when that's hydrogenated, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced. Nitriles upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically become primary amines, but wait, perhaps under different conditions, maybe they're reduced to CH2NH2, but that's speculative.

Wait, another approach: in the presence of H2 and Pd, the nitrile group (-CN) would reduce to a primary amine (-CH2NH2), but that doesn't seem to fit with the next steps. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is of another group. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is of the carbonyl group in A, but no, since B is formed from A and HCN, so B has a hydroxyl and cyanide group.

Wait, perhaps the cyanide group is hydrogenated to an amine, so the CN becomes CH2NH2. Then, in compound C, you have a structure with an amine group. Then, when compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid), that might lead to the formation of a diazonium salt, which then undergoes elimination upon heating, perhaps forming a nitrile or a ketone. Wait, but when a diazonium salt undergoes elimination, if adjacent to an amino group, you might get a nitrile or a ketone. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the overall sequence. Let me try to work backwards.

The final step is D → E upon elimination of an inert gas. So, perhaps D has a leaving group adjacent to a good leaving group, and upon elimination, it forms a double bond and releases something inert, like HCl or something else, but since it's inert, maybe like N2 or CO2?

Wait, if D is, say, a nitroso compound, then elimination could form a carbonyl. Alternatively, when D reacts with HNO2, which is nitrous acid, perhaps it's involved in a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Let me think step by step again.

First, let's consider the steps:

A → B: A reacts with HCN → B is a cyanohydrin (R2C(OH)CN).

B → C: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. What's in B? It has an OH group and a CN group. So, the CN group is -C≡N. Upon hydrogenation, the triple bond in CN would reduce. So, CN → CH2NH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: hydrogenation of nitriles typically requires different conditions. For example, hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Ni, Pd, or Pt would reduce the nitrile to an amine. So, R-CN → R-CH2NH2. But under certain conditions, maybe it stops at the imine, but more likely, it goes to the amine.

But wait, compound C is formed from B after H2 and Pd. So, B is a cyanohydrin: R2C(OH)CN. After reduction, perhaps the CN becomes CH2NH2. So, compound C would be R2C(OH)CH2NH2. But amine groups are typically good leaving groups under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Next, compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form D. Nitrous acid is typically used for diazotization of amines, especially primary aliphatic amines under cold (0-5°C) conditions. So, if C has a primary amine, then HNO2 would form a diazonium salt, which could decompose or rearrange.

Wait, but in this case, the amine in C is a secondary amine because it's R2C(OH)CH2NH2. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is R2C(OH)CH2NH2. The NH2 is attached to a CH2, which is connected to a carbon that's connected to two R groups and an OH. So, the amine is a secondary amine because the nitrogen is attached to two carbons (the CH2 and the other from the R groups, but wait, no, the structure is R2C(OH)-CH2NH2. So the NH2 is on a CH2, which is attached to the R2C(OH) group. So, the amine is a primary amine because the nitrogen is attached to only one carbon (the CH2 group). So, then, when treated with nitrous acid, it would form a diazonium salt, which is typically unstable and can undergo elimination.

So, the diazonium salt could undergo a decomposition reaction, perhaps eliminating N2 and forming a carbonyl group. Wait, yes, that's the case. For primary amines, when treated with HNO2, they form diazonium salts, which on warming (or without heating, depending on conditions) can undergo various reactions. One such reaction is the formation of an imidazole, but more commonly, especially in the presence of a good leaving group adjacent to the diazo group, it can eliminate to form a carbonyl. This is known as the Hoffmann elimination, but wait, Hoffmann is more about forming amines. Alternatively, the loss of N2 and the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: if the diazonium salt is adjacent to a hydroxyl group, elimination could occur. For instance, if the structure is R2C(OH)CH2N2+ Cl^- (the diazonium chloride), then perhaps the diazo group (N2+) can leave, and a double bond forms between the adjacent carbons, releasing N2 and forming a carbonyl group. But wait, let me think about the structure.

Suppose in compound C, the structure is R2C(OH)CH2NH2. Upon treatment with nitrous acid, it becomes R2C(OH)CH2N2+ Cl^- (assuming HNO2 comes with Cl- as a counterion). The diazonium salt is unstable and can lose N2, leading to the formation of a carbocation, but if the adjacent carbon has a good leaving group, perhaps elimination occurs.

Wait, but in
