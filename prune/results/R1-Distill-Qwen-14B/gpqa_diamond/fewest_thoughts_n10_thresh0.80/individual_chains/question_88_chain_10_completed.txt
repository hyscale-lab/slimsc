Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins. Hmm, let's break it down.

So the setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they gave these to mice orally. Through imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Others got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. But then they found the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes showed high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Wait, what do I remember about rotavirus and the immune response? Rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis. It's an enteric virus, so it infects the gastrointestinal tract. The immune response against it involves both innate and adaptive immunity. But the question is about the adaptive part, specifically B cells and their response.

GFP is a marker here, so they're probably tracking the proteins through the system. But the proteins were destroyed in the stomach (probably by acid) or entangled in mucus. But some must have gotten through to the Peyer's patches, which are a type of secondary lymphoid organ. Peyer's patches are in the small intestine and serve as inductive sites for mucosal immunity. So when antigens are presented there, B cells get activated.

They isolated proliferating cellsâ€”so these are likely activated B cells. When B cells proliferate, they undergo some processes that affect their antibody diversity. The variable heavy chain gene has high variability, which suggests some process that increases diversity.

Looking at the options: 

Option A) Somatic hypermutation. That occurs in B cells during the generation of diversity in the variable regions of antibodies. It happens after the initial VDJ recombination, particularly in the germinal centers during the immune response. So after the B cells are activated, they undergo this process.

Option B) Complement activation. That's part of the innate immune response, helping to clear pathogens and opsonize them. But I don't think it directly affects the variability of B cell receptors.

Option C) Class switching recombination. That changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but doesn't directly affect the variable regions, so maybe not the reason for high variability in the variable region.

Option D) VDJ recombination. That's the initial process where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the B cell receptor during development in the bone marrow. But if that's already happened, why the high variability now?

Wait, but in the question, they're looking at the variable heavy chain after the B cells have been activated and are proliferating. So in the Peyer's patches, the B cells would be encountering the antigen, getting activated, and then moving to the germinal centers where they undergo somatic hypermutation. That's when the variable regions mutate, increasing the diversity of the antibodies.

So the high variability in variable heavy chain genes after activation suggests that the B cells have undergone somatic hypermutation. The initial VDJ recombination happens during B cell development, but the further mutations are during the immune response.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence imaging reveals that some GFP-tagged proteins are destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, but others reach the Peyer's patches, where they activate B cells. These activated B cells proliferate, and sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cells shows high variability. 

To determine which process is responsible for this variability, we analyze the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptor to increase diversity. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after B cell activation.

- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect the variability of B cell receptors.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variability of the variable regions of the B cell receptor.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This is the initial process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region. However, this process has already occurred before the B cells encounter the antigen and proliferate in the Peyer's patches.

The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes after B cell activation suggests that the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in germinal centers.

Answer: A
