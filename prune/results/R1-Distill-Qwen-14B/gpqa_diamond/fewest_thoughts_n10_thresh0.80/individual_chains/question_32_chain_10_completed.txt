Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So, lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons in total.

Wait, let me think. So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, I need to calculate the energy of the RHIC when the speed is 0.96c. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy isn't just kinetic—it's the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy.

The formula for the total energy (gamma * m0c²) comes into play here. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me plug that in.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's compute (0.96)^2 first. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Take the square root of that, which is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate that precisely. 1 divided by 0.28.

Hmm, 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 3.5 times 0.28 is 0.98. Oh wait, 0.28 * 3.57 is roughly 1? Let me compute 0.28 * 3.5714: 3.5714 times 0.28.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So v = 0.96c → v²/c² = 0.9216. So 1 - that is 0.0784. The square root is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy is gamma * m0c². But wait, m0 here is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

What is the mass of Li-6? Well, the atomic mass of Li-6 is needed. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of its components. But maybe it's easier to look up the atomic mass. Alternatively, since I don't have exact values, perhaps I can use the fact that the mass number is about 6.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. For a nucleus, the rest mass energy is its mass times c squared. But to get the mass, I need the actual mass. So perhaps the mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Because Li-6 has a mass number of 6, so 6 u.

Wait, but each u is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So 6 u is 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 9.963e-27 kg.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me get the exact value. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.012 u. Because, wait, the exact value isn't just 6 u because of binding energy. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the approximation is sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number as 6, so 6 u.

Wait, but in reality, the mass of Li-6 is about 6.012 atomic mass units. Let me verify: Lithium-6 has a mass of approximately 6.012 u. So yeah, m0 is 6.012 u.

So, the mass m0 = 6.012 u.

Now, converting u into kg: 1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So m0 = 6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Let me calculate that.

6.012 * 1.66053906660e-27 = ?

Well, 6 * 1.660539e-27 = 9.963234e-27. Then 0.012 * 1.660539e-27 is 0.019926468e-27, which is 1.9926468e-29. Adding them together: 9.963234e-27 + 1.9926468e-29 = approximately 9.963234e-27 + 0.019926468e-27 = 9.98316e-27 kg. Wait, no, wait: 1.9926468e-29 is equal to 0.019926468e-27. So adding 9.963234e-27 + 0.019926468e-27 gives 9.983160468e-27 kg.

So m0 = 9.98316e-27 kg.

Now, the speed is 0.96c, so gamma is 3.5714 as before.

So the total energy E is gamma * m0 c².

Wait, but wait. c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute m0 c² first.

m0 c² = (9.98316e-27 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²) = 9.98316e-27 * 9e16 = 8.984844e-10 J.

But wait, that's the rest energy. Then multiply by gamma to get the total energy.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 8.984844e-10 J.

Compute 3.5714 * 8.984844e-10.

3 * 8.984844e-10 is 2.695453e-9.

0.5714 * 8.984844e-10 = let's compute 0.5 * 8.984844e-10 = 4.492422e-10, and 0.0714 * 8.984844e-10 ≈ 6.41e-11.

So 4.492422e-10 + 6.41e-11 = approx 5.1334e-10.

Adding that to the 2.695453e-9 gives 3.2088e-9 J.

Wait, but that's the total energy in joules. The problem asks for the energy in GeV, I think.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, which is 1.60218e-10 J.

So E is 3.2088e-9 J divided by 1.60218e-10 J/GeV.

That's 3.2088e-9 / 1.60218e-10 = approximately 20 GeV.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

3.2088e-9 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV = (3.2088 / 1.60218) * 10^( -9 +10 ) = (2.002) * 10^1 ≈20.02 GeV.

Wait, but let me do the exact calculation.

Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

m0 c² in GeV: Since 1 u c² is about 931.5 MeV (because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c²). So 6.012 u = 6.012 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.012 * 931.5 = 11.178 MeV. Total is 5589 +11.178 = 5600.178 MeV, which is 5.600178 GeV.

So m0 c² is approximately 5.600 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.600 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6.

3 *5.6 =16.8.

0.5714 *5.6 = 0.5 *5.6=2.8, 0.0714 *5.6≈0.40144. So 2.8 + 0.40144 = 3.20144.

So total is 16.8 +3.20144=20.00144 GeV. So approximately 20.001 GeV.

Wait, but the options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, 20 GeV isn't exactly an option. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I was a bit too approximate in my calculations.

Let me think again. Maybe I should compute the exact gamma value.

v = 0.96c → beta = 0.96.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28.

Wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

Wait, but maybe the exact value of m0 c² is more precise. Let's compute it again.

Li-6 has a mass of 6.012 u. So m0 c² is 6.012 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.012 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.012 *931.5 = 11.178.

So total is 5589 +11.178 =5600.178 MeV =5.600178 GeV.

So gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.600178 GeV.

Let me compute that exactly.

3.57142857 * 5.600178.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000178 =approx 0.000633 GeV.

So adding up:

17.85714285 +2.142857142 =20.0, plus 0.000633 gives about 20.000633 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0006 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the mass. Let me check again.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.012 u, correct? Wait, no, another thought: the mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy. Oh wait, but when using the mass in atomic mass units, it's the exact mass including binding energy. So 6.012 u is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for gamma was wrong. Let me recalculate gamma.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) where beta is 0.96.

1 - beta² =1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the atomic mass. Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I'm just a student, so I might not have the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass as 6 u, so 6 *931.5 MeV =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Wait, let's try that.

So m0c² =5.589 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute that.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589 = let me compute 0.5 *5.589 =2.7945.

Then 0.07142857 *5.589 ≈0.400.

Adding them gives 2.7945 +0.400=3.1945.

So total is 16.767 +3.1945=20. (16.767 +3.1945=20. (16.767+3=19.767; 19.767+0.1945=19.9615? Wait, maybe I should do more precise calculation.)

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7. So 4/7 *5.589 = (5.589 *4)/7.

5.589 *4=22.356.

22.356 /7=3.193714.

So E =5.589 *3.57142857 = let me compute 5.589 *3.57142857.

Alternatively, 3.57142857 is 25/7. So 5.589 *25/7 = (5.589 *25)/7.

5.589 *25=139.725.

139.725 /7= 19.9607142857 GeV.

So approximately 19.96 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options are exactly that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6 u but the actual isotope mass.

Wait, let me think again. The mass of Li-6 is 6.012 u. So 6.012 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.012 *931.5 = Let me compute 6 *931.5=5589, 0.012 *931.5=11.178. So 5589+11.178=5600.178 MeV=5.600178 GeV.

So m0c²=5.600178 GeV.

E= gamma * m0c² =3.57142857 *5.600178.

Let me compute 3 *5.600178=16.800534.

0.57142857 *5.600178: 0.5 *5.600178=2.800089.

0.07142857 *5.600178= approx 0.400013.

Adding 2.800089 +0.400013=3.200102.

Total E=16.800534 +3.200102=20.000636 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0006 GeV. But the options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419

So none of the options exactly match 20.0006. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. So why is there a discrepancy?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in using the mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects relativistic energy to be calculated using another approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the kinetic energy (K) instead of the total energy (E). Because sometimes in particle physics, when they say "energy", they sometimes refer to kinetic energy, especially in colliders.

Wait, what's the difference between kinetic energy and total energy?

Total energy E = gamma m0 c².

Kinetic energy K = (gamma - 1) m0 c².

Wait, if the question is asking for the total energy, then E is around 20 GeV. But if it's asking for the kinetic energy, then K = (3.5714 -1) *5.600178 GeV = (2.5714) *5.600178 ≈14.4 GeV. But looking at the options, none are close to that.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

In high-energy physics, colliders usually refer to the kinetic energy per particle. Wait, but sometimes the total energy is stated. So perhaps I should check both possibilities.

Wait, let's compute the kinetic energy.

K = (gamma - 1) m0c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

So K =2.57142857 *5.600178 GeV.

2.5714 *5.6 = 2.5714 *5 =12.857, 2.5714 *0.6=1.54284. Total 14.3998.

But 2.57142857*5.600178 exactly: 2.57142857 *5.6 = let's compute 2.57142857 *5=12.85714285, 2.57142857*0.6=1.54285714. Sum is 14.39999999 ≈14.4 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I should stick with the initial calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nucleus is a deuteron or something else. Wait, no, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6. So I think I did that right.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

v = 0.96c.

beta = 0.96.

So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

What is sqrt(0.0784)?

Well, 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

That seems correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the relativistic energy equation where E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

But when you have high speeds, the momentum p is gamma m0 v.

But for the energy, that's the same as gamma m0 c². So the initial approach was correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate everything precisely.

Let me compute E = gamma * m0 c².

Gamma =3.57142857.

m0 c² =6.012 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.012 *931.5 = let's compute exactly.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.012 *931.5 =11.178.

So 5589 +11.178=5600.178 MeV =5.600178 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.600178 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5.600178.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.600178.

Multiply 3.57142857 *5.600178:

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600178 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.000178 = approximately 0.000633 GeV.

So total for 0.600178 is 2.14285714 +0.000633=2.14349014.

So overall E =17.85714285 +2.14349014 =20.000633 GeV.

So about 20.0006 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but 20.0006 isn't very close to 20.132. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass or in the gamma calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses a different value for c, like 3e8 m/s, but that's unlikely to affect the precision here.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more precisely. Let's compute gamma again.

Beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -beta²) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28.

Wait, perhaps 0.0784's square root is not exactly 0.28.

Wait, wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So that's exact. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the mass of the nucleus. Maybe I should consider the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.012199 u. So 6.012199 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that.

6.012199 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.012199 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.002199 *931.5 → 0.002 *931.5=1.863, 0.000199 *931.5≈0.184. So 1.863 +0.184=2.047. So 9.315 +2.047=11.362.

So total m0 c² =5589 +11.362 =5600.362 MeV =5.600362 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.600362 GeV.

Compute this.

3 *5.600362 =16.801086.

0.57142857 *5.600362 → 0.5 *5.600362=2.800181.

0.07142857 *5.600362 → approximately 0.400026.

Add 2.800181 +0.400026 =3.200207.

Total E=16.801086 +3.200207=20.001293 GeV.

So approximately 20.0013 GeV.

Still, none of the options exactly match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so in the lab frame, the energy is the total energy, but sometimes in these problems, they consider the kinetic energy or perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let's see.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m0 c².

So K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.600362 GeV.

So, 2.57142857 *5.600362.

Compute 2.57142857 *5=12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.600362 → 2.57142857 *0.6=1.542857142, and 2.57142857 *0.000362≈0.000931.

So 1.542857142 +0.000931=1.543788142.

So K=12.85714285 +1.543788142=14.400931 GeV.

But the question is about the energy of the collider, which usually refers to the total energy per nucleus.

Wait, but the options are all around 20 GeV, so perhaps I should stick with the initial approach.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion is between proton and nucleus mass. Wait, no, the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the mass. Let me think again: the mass of Li-6 is 6.012 u. So 6.012 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.012 *931.5 = let me compute precisely: 6*931.5=5589; 0.012*931.5=11.178. Sum is 5600.178 MeV=5.600178 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the exact value of 1 u =931.494 MeV/c². So 6.012 u is 6.012 *931.494 MeV.

Compute that: 6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.012 *931.494=11.177928.

Sum:5588.964 +11.177928=5600.141928 MeV=5.600141928 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.600141928 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.600141928.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600141928 → Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714, and 3.57142857 *0.000141928≈0.000506.

So 2.14285714 +0.000506=2.14336314.

So E=17.85714285 +2.14336314=20.000506 GeV.

Hmm, same as before. So about 20.0005 GeV.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, option D is 21.419 GeV. That's higher than our calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again, but more accurately.

v =0.96c.

beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is calculated using the relativistic energy equation: E = gamma m0 c².

But perhaps m0 is the rest mass of a single nucleon, not the nucleus. Oh wait, no, the question says the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So the nucleus is moving as a whole, so its mass is the mass of the entire nucleus.

Wait, unless the problem is calculating the energy per nucleon. But that would be a different approach.

Wait, but the question says 'the energy of the RHIC' which is usually the total energy of the colliding nuclei. So perhaps each nucleus has energy E, and since RHIC collides two nuclei, the total energy is 2E, but the question is asking for E per nucleus.

Wait, but the options are single values, so perhaps it's the energy per nucleus.

Hmm. So perhaps I should proceed with the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.012199 u. So m0c²=6.012199 *931.494 MeV.

Compute that.

6.012199 *931.494 → let me compute this precisely.

6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.012199 *931.494 → 0.01*931.494=9.31494.

0.002199 *931.494 → let me compute 0.002 *931.494=1.862988.

0.000199 *931.494= approx 0.184 (since 0.0002*931.494=0.1862988).

So 1.862988 +0.184≈2.046988.

So 9.31494 +2.046988=11.361928.

So total m0c²=5588.964 +11.361928=5600.325928 MeV=5.600325928 GeV.

E=gamma *m0c²=3.57142857 *5.600325928 GeV.

Compute this:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600325928.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000325928≈0.001166.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.001166≈2.144023.

So E=17.85714285 +2.144023≈20.001165 GeV.

Still around 20.001 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I should consider another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as 0.96c, but I should calculate the total energy using the formula E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ), but I'm not sure if that would change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the rest mass energy correctly, but perhaps the question expects the calculation of the kinetic energy multiplied by gamma. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the relativistic momentum formula p = gamma m0 v.

But the energy is still gamma m0 c², which is what I used.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate E again.

E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.600325928 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.600325928.

Let me compute 3 *5.600325928=16.80097778.

0.57142857 *5.600325928 → 0.5 *5.600325928=2.800162964.

0.07142857 *5.600325928≈0.400023.

Adding 2.800162964 +0.400023=3.200185964.

So total E=16.80097778 +3.200185964=20.00116374 GeV.

So approximately 20.00116 GeV.

This is extremely close to 20 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I don't see how that would happen unless I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is different. Let me double-check the exact mass. Lithium-6 has a mass of approximately 6.012199 u, yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a collection of nucleons, each with their own gamma. No, that doesn't make sense because the nucleus moves as a whole.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the speed as a fraction of c and then the kinetic energy, but that still doesn't solve the discrepancy.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the problem expects the use of the relativistic formula for energy, but perhaps the velocity is given as a fraction, and they used a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total energy using the relation E = gamma m0 c², but with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.600178 GeV more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.600178.

Breaking it down: 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600178 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000178 =0.000633 GeV.

So 2.142857142 +0.000633=2.143490142.

Adding to the 17.85714285 gives 20.000633 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact gamma value without rounding. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

Gamma =1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Compute 1 - (0.96)^2 =1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So, perhaps the issue is with the number of significant figures. Perhaps the question expects more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.5714285714 *5.600178 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.600178.

Calculate 3.5714285714 *5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.600178 = ?

Compute 3.5714285714 *0.6 =2.14285714284.

3.5714285714 *0.000178 =0.000634285714284.

Adding:2.14285714284+0.000634285714284=2.14349142855.

Adding to 17.857142857: 17.857142857 +2.14349142855=20.00063428555 GeV.

So about 20.000634 GeV.

Still, it's around 20.0006 GeV, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as 0.96c, but perhaps there's an error in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute gamma as (1 -v²/c²)^-½.

v =0.96c → v²/c²=0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that the nucleus is Li-6. Let me think again. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li has atomic number 3, so the nucleus would be Li-6, as 3 protons +3 neutrons=6 nucleons. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the atomic mass including electrons. No, the mass of the nucleus is the mass of the protons, neutrons, and electrons are part of the atom, but in the nucleus, we only have protons and neutrons. So I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the use of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, but that would require knowing the other particle's energy as well. I think not, as the question states the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute m0 c² more precisely.

m0 =6.012 u.

1 u =931.494063 MeV/c².

So m0 c²=6.012 *931.494063 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494063=5588.964378 MeV.

0.012 *931.494063=11.17792876 MeV.

So total m0c²=5588.964378 +11.17792876=5600.142307 MeV=5.600142307 GeV.

E=gamma * m0c²=3.57142857 *5.600142307 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600142307 → 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000142307≈0.000507.

So total for 0.600142307 is 2.142857142 +0.000507≈2.143364.

E=17.85714285 +2.143364=20.00050685 GeV.

Still around 20.0005 GeV.

Hmm. There must be a mistake somewhere, but I can't find it. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass of the nucleus is not 6 u but uses the exact value including binding energy.

Wait, Lithium-6's exact mass is 6.012199 u.

So m0 c² =6.012199 *931.494063 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494063=5588.964378.

0.012199 *931.494063= let's compute:

0.01 *931.494063=9.31494063.

0.002199 *931.494063= approx 2.046988.

Adding:9.31494063 +2.046988=11.36192863.

So m0 c²=5588.964378 +11.36192863=5600.326307 MeV=5.600326307 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.600326307 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600326307 → 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000326307≈0.001166.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.001166≈2.144023.

E=17.85714285 +2.144023≈20.001165 GeV.

Still around 20 GeV.

I'm not sure where the discrepancy is. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I can't reconcile that with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.012199 u. So I think I used that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass in kilograms and not in atomic mass units. Let me try that.

m0 =6.012 u *1.66053906660e-27 kg/u =6.012 *1.66053906660e-27 =approx 9.983e-27 kg.

E= gamma * m0 c².

Gamma=3.57142857.

c=3e8 m/s.

So m0 c²=9.983e-27 kg*(3e8 m/s)^2=9.983e-27 *9e16=8.9847e-10 J.

E=3.57142857 *8.9847e-10 J=32.175e-10 J.

Now, convert J to GeV.

1 eV=1.60218e-19 J → 1 GeV=1.60218e-10 J.

So E=32.175e-10 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV=32.175 /1.60218≈20.08 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.08 GeV, still not matching the options.

Wait, wait, 32.175e-10 J is 3.2175e-9 J.

3.2175e-9 J /1.60218e-10 J/GeV=20.08 GeV.

So that's about 20.08 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options are close. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, which is close to 20.08 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for c and other constants.

But given the time I've spent, I think the correct approach is that the energy is approximately 20 GeV, and the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.012 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.012 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5.600178 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.600178 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
- \( 3 \times 5.600178 = 16.800534 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( 0.5714 \times 5.600178 \approx 3.200102 \, \text{GeV} \).

Adding these together:

\[
E \approx 16.800534 + 3.200102 = 20.000636 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.0006 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. While the exact calculation yields \( 20.0006 \, \text{GeV} \), minor discrepancies may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

Answer: C
