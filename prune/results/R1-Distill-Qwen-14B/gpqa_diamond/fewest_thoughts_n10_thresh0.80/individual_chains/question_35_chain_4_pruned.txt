Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. So, first, I think I should write down what Ay is. The problem says Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, h is Planck's constant. And S is a 2x2 matrix given as the first row being (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). 

Wait, let me write that S matrix out. So S would be:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So I can compute Ay by multiplying each element of S by c.

Let me compute that. The first row of Ay would be [0, -i * c], and the second row [i * c, 0]. So substituting c, the elements are 0, -i*(h/(4π)), i*(h/(4π)), 0.

So the matrix Ay looks like:
[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0      ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let me set that up. The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:
[ -a          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a          ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a^2 - [ (i*(-i) h^2)/(16 π²) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that product in the brackets: (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product becomes (1 * h²)/(16 π²) ). So the determinant equation becomes
