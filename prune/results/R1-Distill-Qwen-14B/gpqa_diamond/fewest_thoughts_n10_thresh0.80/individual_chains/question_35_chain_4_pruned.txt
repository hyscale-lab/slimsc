Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h over 4π, and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Oh wait, that looks familiar. Isn't S the Pauli Y matrix? I think the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? And S here is σy.

So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1, but let me think about how that scales here.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices, and each has eigenvalues ±1. Since Ay is a multiple of σy, let me write down the matrix first.

σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, multiplying by c = h/(4π), Ay becomes [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]].

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(Ay - λI) = 0. Let me set that up. The matrix Ay - λI would be [[-λ, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), -λ]]. The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)).

So, determinant is λ² - [ (i * (-i)) (h/(4π))² ].

Wait, i * (-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes λ² - (1 * (h²)/(16 π²)) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait a minute, so the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the real parts are just these values because they are real numbers. The imaginary parts are zero.
