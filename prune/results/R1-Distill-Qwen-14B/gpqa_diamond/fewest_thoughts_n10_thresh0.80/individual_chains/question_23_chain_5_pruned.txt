Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. I need to determine which of the given options are the possible products.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better. The benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached to a but-3-en-1-yl chain, which is substituted with two methyl groups on the second carbon.

So the structure is something like this: benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait no, that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, that's not possible because numbering starts from the end. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the substituents are on the 3rd position, but only four carbons in the chain. So the structure is CH2-CH
