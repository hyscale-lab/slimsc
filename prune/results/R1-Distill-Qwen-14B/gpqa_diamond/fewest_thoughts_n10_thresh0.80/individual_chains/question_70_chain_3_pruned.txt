Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, each representing different symmetry groups. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are part of molecular spectroscopy and structure determination, so I'll need to figure out what E's structure is first.

Let's break down the reactions one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So A + 8B → C. What could this be? Bright red product... that makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, maybe it's lead dioxide? No, that's dark. Alternatively, I've heard that when metals react with certain gases, they form oxides.

Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents sound like a stoichiometric number that's high. For example, the reaction of a metal with oxygen. Let me think, if A is a metal, say lead (Pb), and reacting with O2, but how would the stoichiometry work? Lead usually forms PbO2, which is lead dioxide. Let me check the reaction: 4Pb + 5O2 → 2PbO2. No, that's 5 moles of O2 per 4 Pb, so 5/4 per Pb, which is 1.25. Not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's another metal. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where a metal oxide is formed. Let's think about what forms a bright red product. Oh! I remember that when metals like iron or copper react with certain gases, they can form colored compounds. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and chlorine gas?

Wait, but the product C is used in another reaction. Let's look at the next reaction. C reacts with two equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2D → E. What's E? If D is a gas, perhaps a halogen? Wait, but D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D combine to make H, a solvent. Let me think about solvents: H could be something like H2O, but that's just a thought.

Wait, wait, another angle. Let's look at the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it produces A, F,
