Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when compounds absorb certain wavelengths of light, they emit others. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but let's think it through.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I think the energy of the emitted light relates to the energy gap in the molecule. Oh right, the energy of the photon emitted is equal to the difference between the energy levels of the molecule. So, the higher the energy, the shorter the wavelength of the emitted light.

But wait, the question is asking what color is absorbed, not emitted. Oh, right, because electrons get excited when they absorb light. So when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state to a higher one. Then, when it relaxes back, it emits a photon. The energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference between the states.

So the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. That means the energy gap is 2.3393 eV. So the compound must absorb a photon of that same energy. Because when it absorbs, it excites the electron, and then when it emits, it's the same energy.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes the energy could vary slightly, but I think in this case, the emitting energy is the same as the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has the same energy as the emitted?

But wait, what if the compound emits a photon when the electron drops from a higher energy state to a lower one. So the absorbed photon would be the energy that caused the excitation, which is the same as the energy gap. So the absorption would be at that energy.

Now, the next part is converting eV to wavelength. Because knowing the wavelength will tell us the color.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So λ = hc/E.

I remember the value of hc is about 1240 eV·nm. Oh, right, so λ (in nm) is approximately 1240 divided by E (in eV).

So let's compute that. 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's see. 2.3393 is roughly 2.34. So 1240 /
