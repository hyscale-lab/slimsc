Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh right, the interaction term is likely something like L = -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f, since the v might be a vacuum expectation value (but I'm not entirely sure if that's part of the interaction here). But for the decay, the important part is that the boson X couples to fermions via this term.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to determine which fermion pairs X can decay into, considering conservation laws and kinematics.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of the boson. Because in decay processes, the total energy needs to be sufficient to create the daughter particles.

So, I should list the possible fermions and their masses.

Fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), charged leptons (electron, muon, tau), and neutrinos. But wait, does the X boson couple to neutrinos? Looking back at the Lagrangian, the interaction is between X and ψ_f, which are fermions. But the coupling is proportional to λ f, where f might be the fermion type. But if the interaction only includes charged fermions, then neutrinos (which are neutral) wouldn't be involved. So X can decay into charged fermions, but not neutrinos. Because the interaction term would require the fermions to have charge, perhaps. Or maybe the term is written such that it couples to Dirac fermions, which include all charged leptons and quarks.

Wait, the term is ψ̄_f X ψ_f. So X is a scalar (since it's a boson) and the interaction is Yukawa-like. The coupling is proportional to X times the fermion field. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion has this interaction.

Now, the fermions available are all the quarks and charged leptons. But their masses vary.

So, to find allowed decays, I need to check which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Let me list the approximate masses:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV (negligible)
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos: superlight, but probably negligible, and maybe X doesn't couple to them.

So, the possible decay products would be pairs where the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV.

But wait, the fermions come in pairs, so each pair would be a quark and antiquark or a lepton and antilepton.

Let me consider each possible pair:

1. b quark pair (b b̄): Each b is about 4.5 GeV. So 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV, so decay into b b̄ is not allowed. So any option including b b̄ can't be correct.

2. s quark pair: s mass ~100 MeV each. 200 MeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So s s̄ is allowed.

3. u quark pair: u
