Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

First, the question gives a Lagrangian interaction term. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think I might be misreading that. Oh right, probably it's L(y) = -λ ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but maybe the 'f' indices are part of the fermion fields. So X is a bosonic field interacting with fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and we're to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

I remember that for a particle to decay into other particles, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into. Because in particle physics, the conservation of energy and momentum requires that the rest mass of the decaying particle is at least the sum of the rest masses of the products.

So, X is a boson with mass 6 GeV. Let me think about which fermions are light enough so that two of them can have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Fermions include quarks, leptons, etc. Let me list their masses. Wait, I should probably recall the approximate masses in GeV/c².

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But wait, the top quark is really heavy, around 173 GeV. So it's way above 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks.

Leptons: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ), and their neutrinos. Neutrinos are very light, almost massless. But the charged leptons have masses. Electrons are about 0.0005 GeV, muons about 0.1 GeV, taus about 1.77 GeV.

So, let's think about possible decay products. X can decay into:

- Fermion-antifermion pairs.

We need the sum of the masses of the fermion pair to be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but for some fermions, like electrons, their mass is negligible compared to 6 GeV. So X could decay into e+ e- because 2*m_e is almost zero, so it's definitely allowed.

Same with muons. 2*m_mu is about 0.2 GeV, way below 6. So mu+ mu- is allowed.

Taus are heavier, 2*m_tau is about 3.54 GeV. So that's allowed because 3.54 <6.

What about quarks? The masses vary.

Light quarks: u and d have masses about 2-5 MeV (million eV), which is
