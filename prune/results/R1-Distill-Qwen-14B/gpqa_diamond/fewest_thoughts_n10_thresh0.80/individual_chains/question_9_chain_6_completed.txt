Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me try to think this through.

First, I need to remember what C3H symmetry means. Oh right, C3H is a type of symmetry operation. Wait, C3H... wait, maybe it's a miswrite. Oh wait, no, I think C3H refers to a point group. Or is it a type of symmetry element? Let me think. Oh, I think C3H is a cyclic group with a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe it's C3v symmetry. No, wait, C3H could be a specific notation. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a molecule with threefold rotational symmetry, perhaps along with some other symmetry element.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in organic chemistry, when a molecule has a symmetric structure, like when parts are arranged in a way that can be rotated in 120-degree increments, it would have C3 symmetry. But the 'H' partâ€”maybe that's indicating a horizontal mirror plane? Or perhaps it's a specific symbol. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should look up the definition of C3H symmetry, but since I can't, I'll make an educated guess.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is about whether the molecule has a three-fold axis of rotation. So, a C3 axis. If a molecule has a three-fold axis, then the point group would be something like C3 or D3h, depending on other symmetry elements.

Looking at the options, I have four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two others with long names. Let's analyze each.

First option is triisopropyl borate. Structure-wise, I think triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO. The boron is at the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. So, the structure is trigonal pyramidal because boron has a trigonal planar arrangement but with a lone pair, making it trigonal pyramidal. Wait, no, wait. Boron typically has three bonding pairs and no lone pair in such compounds. So, the structure is trigonal planar. But wait, if the three substituents are all the same, then the molecule would have a C3 axis. So, if all three isopropyl groups are the same, then yes, a three-fold rotation axis would exist. So, triisopropyl would have C3 symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about C3H symmetry. Hmm. Not sure. Let me move on and check the other options.

Quinuclidine is another option. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, right? It's a bridge structure with a seven-membered ring. The structure is a bicyclo[3.3.1]heptane, I think. The molecule has a chair-like structure, similar to norbornane. Now, symmetry-wise, does quinuclidine have a three-fold axis? I remember that norbornane (which is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) has a C2 axis, but quinuclidine is a different structure. Wait, quinuclidine is also known as adamantane's derivative? Or maybe not. Let me think about its structure. It's a bicyclo with three bridges, perhaps. The molecule has a three-fold axis? Wait, I'm not so sure. Maybe it's C2h symmetry or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic structure. I'm not certain, but I don't think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. So probably not option D.

Now, looking at the third and fourth options, which are both long names, probably indicating polycyclic compounds.

The third option is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let's try to visualize. The name suggests a structure with three fused furan rings (trifuran), with some numbering. The substituents are benzene rings at certain positions. But I'm not sure how the substituents are arranged. The presence of three benzene rings might disrupt symmetry, but maybe the molecule has some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a symmetric arrangement, but I'm not certain.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So, similar structure but with phenyl groups attached. The numbering might imply a different arrangement. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, perhaps this molecule has a three-fold axis.

Wait a second, maybe looking at the substituents helps. For the third option, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c''], perhaps the benzene rings are attached in a way that the molecule could have three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a triangular fashion around the central structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation, such as each benzene group being in a position that's 120 degrees apart from each other.

Wait, thinking about triphenylene derivatives. Triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetrical way, forming a triangular structure. If this molecule has a similar arrangement, perhaps the substituents are symmetrically placed, leading to C3 symmetry.

Looking back at the options, the third option is benzo... and the fourth is triphenyleno. So, the fourth option probably has a triphenylene-like structure, which is symmetric.

Wait, what is triphenylene? Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric triangular shape, leading to a high degree of symmetry, including C3 symmetry.

So, if the fourth option is a triphenyleno derivative with a trifuran system, then perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically, leading to C3 symmetry.

But wait, the question is about C3H symmetry. Hmm. Or perhaps it's C3v or D3h symmetry. Well, perhaps the presence of multiple substituents arranged symmetrically would give a higher symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the first option, triisopropyl borate, has a trigonal planar structure with three identical substituents. So, the molecule would have a C3 axis. Because all three isopropyl groups are the same, any rotation by 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. So, that would give it a C3 symmetry. But would that be C3H?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the 'H' part. C3H symmetry might relate to a three-fold axis with a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the H denotes that it's a chiral center or something else. Wait, no, H in the point group is for a horizontal mirror plane. So, for a molecule to have C3H symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, let's think about each option again.

Triisopropyl borate: The boron is in the center with three identical isopropyl groups. The structure is trigonal planar. So, it's a flat molecule. Thus, a horizontal mirror plane would be possible. If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane (like the plane of the molecule) would exist. So, if it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, it would belong to the C3h point group. So, this molecule might have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I'm not so sure. Its structure is more three-dimensional. It's a bridge structure, so I don't think it's planar. So, maybe no horizontal mirror plane. So, perhaps C3 symmetry is not present.

The other two options: they have benzene rings attached. If they're arranged symmetrically, perhaps each of the three substituents is placed symmetrically. For example, if the substituents are at 120-degree positions, that would allow for a three-fold rotation. But whether they have a horizontal mirror plane depends on the structure.

Wait, if the molecule is planar, then the plane could be a horizontal mirror. For instance, if the benzene rings are all in the same plane, then a mirror plane could exist.

Hmm. Let's think about the third option: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. So, this is a trifuran, which is three fused furan rings. The substituents are benzene rings attached at certain positions. If each benzene is attached in a way that's spaced 120 degrees apart, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis. For example, if each benzene is attached to a position that's one-third around the central structure, then rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth option, triphenyleno..., has a more symmetric structure. Triphenylene itself is symmetric, so maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that preserves C3 symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the first option, triisopropyl borate, is the one with C3h symmetry. Because, in that molecule, the three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically. So, any rotation by 120 degrees would leave the molecule looking the same. Also, the molecule is planar, so the plane bisecting the boron would serve as a horizontal mirror plane. So, that would make it have both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, thus C3h.

Wait, but in reality, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. So, trigonal planar geometry implies C3v symmetry, I think. Because trigonal planar has a three-fold rotation axis and three mirror planes, each bisecting a pair of substituents. So, the point group would be C3v. So, if the question is about C3h symmetry, that's different. So, maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is another molecule.

Let me think again about the other options.

The fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. So, it's a trifuran with triphenylene substituents. Triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule. So, if the substituents are attached symmetrically, the overall molecule could have C3 symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each phenyl group is in a position that's 120 degrees apart. So, a three-fold rotation would map the structure onto itself.

In that case, the molecule would have a C3 axis. If it's planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would also be present, making it C3h.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not planar, so the horizontal mirror plane is not present.

This is tricky. Maybe I should think about the structures.

Triisopropyl borate: (i-Pr)3B. The structure is trigonal planar, with B in the center. So, three identical substituents. The trigonal planar geometry would have C3v symmetry. So, it has a three-fold rotation axis and three vertical mirror planes. So, it wouldn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it would belong to C3v, not C3h.

So, option C is triisopropyl borate, which is option C. So, if the question is about C3h, then option C isn't correct.

Wait, but the options list is:

A) triphenyleno[...]
B) benzo[...]
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So, if the correct answer isn't C, then perhaps another option.

Now, looking back at the question, the options are A, B, C, D. The question is which has C3h symmetry.

So, if triisopropyl borate is C3v, then it's not C3h. So, maybe none of the others have C3h. But I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the 'H' in C3H refers to a horizontal mirror plane, but the molecule is non-planar. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 'H' isn't a mirror plane but a different symmetry element. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the molecule having three identical substituents arranged symmetrically, which would give C3 symmetry regardless of the mirror plane.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to identify which molecules have a three-fold rotation axis, regardless of other symmetry elements. So, the question is about C3 symmetry, not necessarily C3h.

If that's the case, let's reevaluate.

Triisopropyl borate has three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around the central atom. So, it has a three-fold rotation axis. So, it would have C3 symmetry. So, it would fit the question if the question is about C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth option is a tricyclic structure with three identical substituents.

Wait, but the name of the fourth option is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... Hmm, the substituents are phenyl rings attached at positions 1,2-c; 5,6-c'; 9,10-c''. So, if each of the three substituents is a phenyl group attached in a symmetrical fashion, then the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis.

In that case, the fourth option would have C3 symmetry, making it the correct answer.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Maybe considering the number of substituents and their symmetry.

Another thought: Quinuclidine has a structure with three equivalent bridges, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's more like a chair structure with two-fold symmetry.

Wait, I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis. Let me think. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a norbornane derivative with an additional bridge, making it a tricyclic structure. So, perhaps it has a three-fold axis. Alternatively, maybe it's more symmetric than that. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno[...]trifuran has three identical substituents, leading to a three-fold axis.

Wait, another approach: looking for a molecule with a three-fold axis, regardless of the 'H' part. Let's assume that the question meant C3 symmetry and not C3H. So, which of the options have a three-fold axis?

Triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, so option C would be the answer. But earlier I thought that it's C3v, which is a different point group.

Wait, but what's the actual point group for (i-Pr)3B? The molecule is trigonal planar, which is C3v. So, it has a three-fold rotation axis and three vertical mirror planes. So, the point group is C3v, not C3h.

But the question is about C3H symmetry, which I think is a typographical error and meant C3 symmetry. Or perhaps it's about a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, which is C3h.

Wait, C3h is a point group that includes a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, in order for a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold axis that is perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane, and the mirror plane must bisect the molecule.

So, considering each option again:

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The molecule is trigonal planar. So, the three-fold axis is in the plane of the molecule. A horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. So, the molecule would have a horizontal mirror plane as well as a three-fold axis. So, the point group would be C3h.

Wait, but I thought that trigonal planar molecules belong to C3v. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the point groups.

Wait, point groups are determined based on the symmetry elements. C3v has a three-fold axis and three vertical mirror planes. C3h has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, so if the molecule is planar, and the three-fold axis is in the same plane as the mirror plane, then it's C3h.

Alternatively, maybe I should refer to the character tables. But since I can't, I have to think.

In C3h, the three-fold axis is perpendicular to the horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must be symmetrical in such a way that a rotation of 120 degrees plus a reflection in the horizontal plane leaves it unchanged.

So, triisopropyl borate is planar and has a three-fold axis in the plane. So, the horizontal mirror plane would be the plane of the molecule. Thus, it would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, its point group is C3h.

Wait, but trigonal planar structures usually have C3v. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, trigonal planar geometry is for molecules like BF3, which is C3v. So, for (i-Pr)3B, it's similar. So, it has a three-fold axis, three mirror planes, but no horizontal mirror plane. So, it's C3v. So, not C3h.

Then, which option has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane?

Looking at the other options.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis, but whether it has a horizontal mirror plane depends on the structure.

Option B: benzo[...]. Similar to A but with different substituents.

Option D: quinuclidine. I'm not sure if it has a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, let's think about triphenylene. Triphenylene is a planar molecule with three benzene rings arranged in a symmetric triangular fashion. So, it's planar and has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, its point group is C3h.

So, if the fourth option (option A) is a triphenylene derivative, perhaps it inherits the C3h symmetry.

Wait, the fourth option is triphenyleno[...]trifuran. So, the central part is a trifuran, with triphenylene substituents. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule as a whole has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, the benzo[...] option (option B) might not have such symmetry because the substituents are benzene rings attached in a way that breaks three-fold symmetry.

So, perhaps the fourth option, option A, has C3h symmetry.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate, but earlier I thought it was C3v.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option C: triisopropyl borate, because it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, leading to C3h symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I thought that's not the case. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth option is the correct one.

Wait, let me think about the counting of substituents. Triphenylene has three benzene rings, each connected to a central ring in a symmetric way. So, the substituents are arranged at 120-degree positions around the central ring.

If the fourth option is a triphenylene derivative with a trifuran, perhaps the substituents (like the phenyl groups) are arranged symmetrically, leading to a three-fold axis.

If the central structure is symmetric, then the entire molecule would have a three-fold axis.

But whether it has a horizontal mirror plane depends on whether the substituents are placed symmetrically above and below the plane. If the substituents are all in the same plane, then a horizontal mirror plane would exist.

So, perhaps option A has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a non-planar molecule, in which case the mirror plane might not exist.

Hmm, I'm not certain, but based on the names, perhaps the fourth option is the correct one.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A) triphenyleno[...]
Option B) benzo[...]
Option C) triisopropyl borate
Option D) quinuclidine

In the third and fourth options, the substituents are attached to a trifuran system. So, the trifuran is a central structure with three furan rings fused together. The substituents are attached at certain positions.

The fourth option's substituents are triphenylene. So, the substituents are attached in a way that's symmetrical.

So, if each substituent is placed symmetrically at 120 degrees apart, then the molecule has a three-fold axis.

But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to be certain.

Wait, the question is which of the following has C3H symmetry. So, it's about the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Between the options, triisopropyl borate is planar and trigonal planar, which is C3v, not C3h. So, if the question is about C3h, then none of the options would have it, which can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another approach: think of the number of symmetry elements.

C3h symmetry includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must have both elements.

So, looking for a molecule that's flat (planar) and has three-fold symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate is flat, trigonal planar, with a three-fold axis. So, if it has a horizontal mirror plane, it would be C3h. But trigonal planar is C3v, which includes three vertical mirror planes.

Wait, but wait. In the case of trigonal planar, the three substituents are in a plane, and the three-fold axis is in that plane. So, the mirror planes are vertical, passing through each substituent and the opposite side. So, the horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. But, in that case, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, no. Because in the trigonal planar case, the mirror planes are vertical, not horizontal. So, the plane of the molecule isn't a mirror plane. So, triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry, not C3h.

So, perhaps none of the options have C3h symmetry. But that can't be the case. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option A because it's a triphenylene derivative, which is symmetric. Triphenylene itself is planar and has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, giving it C3h symmetry. So, if the substituents in option A are arranged in the same symmetric way, the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

So, bringing it all together, I think the fourth option (option A) is the correct answer.


To determine which molecule has **C3H symmetry**, we analyze the options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C3H symmetry** refers to a molecule having a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). This symmetry implies the molecule must be planar, with substituents arranged symmetrically around a central axis.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option C: Triisopropyl Borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate ((i-Pr)3B) has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around the central boron atom. This gives it a three-fold rotation axis (C3). However, trigonal planar molecules like this belong to the **C3v** point group, which includes three vertical mirror planes but no horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **C3H** symmetry.

2. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure with a bridge-like arrangement. Its symmetry is lower, and it does not have a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not exhibit **C3H** symmetry.

3. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule has a trifuran core with benzene substituents. The substituents are not arranged symmetrically enough to give a three-fold rotation axis. Additionally, there is no horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **C3H** symmetry.

4. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule features a trifuran core with triphenylene substituents. The triphenylene group itself is a symmetric structure with three benzene rings arranged in a triangular fashion, giving it a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. If the substituents are symmetrically attached to the trifuran core, the entire molecule inherits **C3H** symmetry. This makes it the most likely candidate for having **C3H** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone** is the molecule with **C3H** symmetry.

**Answer: A**
