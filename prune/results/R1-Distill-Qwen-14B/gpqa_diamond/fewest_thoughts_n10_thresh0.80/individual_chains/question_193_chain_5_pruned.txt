Okay, I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, the question says that astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, each with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, the formula is parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance. Wait, no, wait. Parallax (π) is inversely proportional to distance (d), so π = 1/d. Or wait, actually, distance d is equal to 1 divided by parallax, so d = 1/π. That makes sense because the closer a star is (smaller d), the larger its parallax (larger π), since parallax is measured in arcseconds and decreases with distance.

So, if the number of stars N varies as 1/π^5, that can be written as N ∝ 1/π^5. But since π = 1/d, substituting that in, π^5 would be (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So 1/π^5 would be d^5. Because 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So that's the number per unit distance, right?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. So the number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/π^5. Since π = 1/d, 1/π is d. So 1/π^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. Oh, but wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, the number of stars increases rapidly. But the question is about the change per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using calculus. The number of stars N is proportional to d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant. The change in N per unit distance would be the derivative dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance. So the change per unit distance is proportional to r^4? Because d here is distance r.

Wait, but looking back at the question, the way it's worded: "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps they're asking for the rate of change, which is the derivative. So the rate is dN/dr. Since N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ 5 r^4, so the change is proportional to r^4.

So looking at the options, option C is r^4, option B is r^5, which would be the N itself. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the number of stars in a region is given as N ∝ 1/π^5
