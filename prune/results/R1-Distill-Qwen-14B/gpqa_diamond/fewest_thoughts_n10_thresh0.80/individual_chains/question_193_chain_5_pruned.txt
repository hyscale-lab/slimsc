Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, the formula given is number of stars N = 1/(plx)^5. But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit distance. So I think I need to relate parallax to distance first.

Parallax plx is equal to 1/(distance in parsecs), right? So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. Oh wait, actually, I think the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So if distance r increases, plx decreases.

So plx = 1/r. Therefore, 1/(plx)^5 would be (r)^5. Because plx is 1/r, so (1/(plx))^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait. The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But substituting plx with 1/r, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Hmm, I think that means the differential change, like the number per unit distance. Or maybe it's the density? Or perhaps it's the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr? Because when you're counting stars in a region, you're considering a volume, I suppose.

Wait, maybe I should think about the volume of a sphere. The volume between two spheres with radius r and r+dr is about 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that volume depends on the density and the volume. If the number of stars per unit volume (density) is proportional to r^5, then the total number in that shell would be density multiplied by volume.

Wait, let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to r^5. So in a region at distance r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But if you're looking at a range dr, the number of stars in that range would be the number per unit volume multiplied by the volume.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. So if N(r) is the number of stars at distance r, then perhaps the number in a thin shell dr is N(r) * 4π r² dr. But the given relationship is N varies as 1/plx^5. So let me substitute plx as 1/r: so N(r) = k * r^5, where k is some constant.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: the question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C * (1/plx)^5, where C is a constant. Since plx =
