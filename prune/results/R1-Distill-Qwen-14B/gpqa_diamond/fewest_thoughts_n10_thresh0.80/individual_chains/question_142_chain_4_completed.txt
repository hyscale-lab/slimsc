Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what's the question exactly?

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is equal to 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors in three dimensions, which probably correspond to the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. Each qubit can be represented as a point on the unit sphere in 3D space. The density matrix for a pure state is a vector from the origin to a point on the unit sphere. But what about mixed states? I think for mixed states, the density matrix doesn't correspond to a single point on the sphere but is instead represented probabilistically.

But wait, this given ρ looks like a mixture of the |0> and |1> states. Let me compute it. Let me write out the matrices.

The |0><0| matrix is a 2x2 matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 at (2,2) and 0 elsewhere. Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element is 1/2.

So ρ is:
[0.5 0]
[0 0.5]

Wait, that's the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5. So ρ = I/2.

I remember that the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a 3D vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to our given ρ, which is I/2. So if I set (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2, then r·σ must be zero.

What does that mean for r? Because σ·r is σx r_x + σy r_y + σz r_z. For this sum to be zero for all σ, each component must be zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. So r is (0,0,0), which is point (0,0,0).

Wait, so the Bloch vector is at the origin. That makes sense because this state is completely mixed, right? It's the maximally mixed state. So in the Bloch sphere, the origin represents the completely mixed state, which is a maximally uncertain state—like a classical 50-50 coin.

So looking at the options:

Option C is (0,0,0), which is exactly what we got. So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a 3D vector. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we see that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This means all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, so \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

In the Bloch sphere, the origin corresponds to the completely mixed state, which matches the interpretation of this density matrix. Among the options provided:

- **A)** \(r = (1,1,0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \(r = (0,0,1)\): Incorrect, as this would represent a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not a mixed state.
- **C)** \(r = (0,0,0)\): Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state.
- **D)** \(r = (1,1,1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \(\mathbf{r} = (0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
