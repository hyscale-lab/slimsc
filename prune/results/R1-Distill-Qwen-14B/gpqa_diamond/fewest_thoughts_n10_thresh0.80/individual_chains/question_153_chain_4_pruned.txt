Okay, so I've got this Michael addition reactions problem, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually enolate, I think. Right, enolate ions attack the beta carbon of the carbonyl.

Let me look at the three reactions given and figure out what's happening in each.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH to give product A. So, what's dimethyl malonate? I recall that malonate is a di-carboxylic ester, so dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. I think it can act as a nucleophile here because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That structure would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (or maybe 2 and 3?), with a p-tolyl group on the 3rd carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-... so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the double bond is between C2 and C3, right? So the structure is CH2-CH-(p-tolyl), but wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-CH-(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Oh wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-R, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be the substituent on the third carbon. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-OCH3. Or maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the alpha carbon (the CH2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Michael reaction involves the nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. When NaOEt is present, it's a base, so it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate then attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So the acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the
