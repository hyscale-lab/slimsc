Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the conductor is uncharged, so initially, there's no charge inside it. But then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Now, since the conductor is a spherical one, I remember that charges inside a cavity of a conductor will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so if there's a +q in the cavity, the inner surface must have an induced -q charge, right? And then the outer surface would have +q to balance, making the total charge zero again. Wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so if the inner cavity has +q, the inner surface induces -q. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge of the conductor is zero. Hmm, but wait, no, wait. The conductor's net charge is zero because it's uncharged. So the inner surface has induced -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the conductor's total charge zero. That makes sense.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, the question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, the centers are separated by a distance s, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, no. Let me read that again. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, the conductor's center is at one point, and the cavity's center is s away from that. So the point P is located at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. The angle theta is between l and s. So if I imagine the conductor and the cavity, the cavity is off-center by s. So the point P is outside, and its position relative to the cavity's center is l, with the angle theta between the line connecting the conductor's center to the cavity's center (length s) and the line from the cavity's center to point P (length l).

Now
