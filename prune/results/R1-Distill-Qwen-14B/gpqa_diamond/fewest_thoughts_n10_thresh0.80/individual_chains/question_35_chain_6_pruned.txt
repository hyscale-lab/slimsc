Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, the problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/4π, right? And S is a specific matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I should write that down.

So S looks like:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π). So Ay would be:

[ 0   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))  0 ]

Wait, but I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-½ particles are usually multiples of the Pauli matrices. Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1/2 for spin, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because of the constants involved.

Wait, let's think about the eigenvalues. The operator Ay has matrix elements as above. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, it should have two eigenvalues. The general approach is to find the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let me set up the matrix (Ay - aI):

[ -a     -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ]

Calculating each part: (-a)^2 is a². The second term: (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] wait wait, let me make sure. The (1,2) element is -i c,
