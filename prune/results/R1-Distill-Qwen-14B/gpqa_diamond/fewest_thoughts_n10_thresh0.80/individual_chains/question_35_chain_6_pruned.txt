Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators have certain properties, especially in quantum mechanics.

So the problem states that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c multiplied by matrix S. And c is h/(4π), right? Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the equation says Ay = c * S. So c is a constant, which is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Oh, that's interesting. So S looks like:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, that reminds me of the Pauli matrices. Oh right! The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall: σy is actually [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, right? So S is σy.

Now, the operator A_y is c multiplied by σy. So I should write out A_y as:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

But wait, the eigenvalues of A_y will be determined by this matrix. Since A_y is proportional to σy, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 multiplied by the proportionality constant. Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by a constant, the eigenvalues are scaled by that constant.

So S (σy) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, A_y has eigenvalues c * (+1) and c * (-1). Because A_y = c S.

So let's compute that. c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a would be h/(4π) * 1 and h/(4π) * (-1). So a = ± h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or something, but that doesn't seem right. Because the eigenvalues are real numbers here, right? Because S is Hermitian, so A_y is Hermitian since c is real. Therefore, eigenvalues are real.

Wait, wait. Wait, the options are talking about the imaginary parts. Hmm. Oh, wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is a Hermitian matrix. So A_y is also Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real. So any option suggesting the eigenvalues have imaginary parts can't be correct. Looking at option A: it says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be right because eigenvalues are real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That would imply eigenvalues are complex, which they aren't. So B is wrong. Option C and D are about eigenfunctions and other operators.

Wait, so the eigenvalues of A_y are a = ±h/(4π). So I think the correct eigenvalues are real. So, looking at the options, none of the A or B options are correct because they mention imaginary parts, which isn't the case.

Wait, but let me double-check. S is σy, which indeed has eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y are ±h/(4π). So, for example, the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

So looking at the options, none of the options A or B are correct. So the correct eigenvalues are real numbers, ±h/(4π). Therefore, any option that claims imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is wrong. So A
