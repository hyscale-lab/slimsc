Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. And I need to find the minimum volume of the acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.

Wait, I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with an acid, it's a neutralization reaction. The hydroxide (which is a base) will react with the strong acid to produce water and a salt. So Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl (a monobasic strong acid) would form FeCl3 and water.

The reaction equation should be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Right? Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH- ions, so it needs three H+ ions to neutralize each OH-.

So the first step is to calculate how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. I think I need to find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let me calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16.00, and Hydrogen (H) is 1.008.

So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1.008). Let's compute that: 3*(17.008) = 51.024. Adding to Fe's 55.85 gives 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol. So the molar mass is approximately 106.87 g/mol.

Now, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.87. Let me see, 106.87 goes into 0.1 about 0.0009358 times. So approximately 9.358e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ (from HCl), the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028075 moles. So about 0.0028075 moles of HCl needed.

But wait, the HCl is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So volume (in liters) = moles / Molarity. So volume = 0.0028075 / 0.1 = 0.028075 liters. To convert to cm^3, since 1 liter is 1000 cm^3, that's 28.075 cm^3. But wait, the options don't have exactly 28 cm^3. Looking at the options:

Option C says 28.05 cm^3. Close enough. So the volume of acid needed is about 28.05 cm^3. So that's the first part of the question.

Now the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. After the reaction, we have FeCl3 dissolved in water. FeCl3 is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So the solution should be acidic because the Fe^3+ ion hydrolyzes in water.

The Fe^3+ ion will undergo hydrolysis: Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. To find the pH, I'll need to calculate the concentration of H+ ions from this hydrolysis.

First, let's find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm^3 (0.1 liters). Moles of Fe^3+ are same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009358 mol.

So concentration [Fe^3+] = moles / volume (in liters) = 0.0009358 / 0.1 = 0.009358 M.

Now, I need the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Hmm, I'm not sure of the exact K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. I think it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can find the K using the hydrolysis reaction.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Wait, but I don't remember the exact K value. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between K and the solubility of Fe(OH)3. Hmm, but I'm not certain about that approach.

Wait, another approach: The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered stepwise. The first step is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+. The second step is Fe(OH)^2+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)2+ ... but maybe it's easier to consider the overall reaction.

Wait, perhaps I can find the K value by knowing the solubility of Fe(OH)3. The solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 is known, but I'm not sure of the exact value. I think the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is around 6e-38. Wait, but that's for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water.

Wait, no, the Ksp is for the dissolution reaction: Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq). So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in this case, the solution is acidic, so OH^- is low. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the K for the hydrolysis reaction using Ksp and other equilibria.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me think again.

When FeCl3 is dissolved in water, the Fe^3+ ions hydrolyze to form H+ ions, making the solution acidic. The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But I don't know K. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate it to the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but in this case, it's acting as a weak acid (since Fe^3+ is hydrolyzing).

Wait, another approach: The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered through the formation of Fe(OH)3. Let me think. The solution after reaction is FeCl3. So the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

Wait, perhaps I can find the K value for the hydrolysis reaction by using the relation between K and the Ksp. Alternatively, perhaps I can look it up, but since I can't access the internet right now, I'll have to proceed with what I remember.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the pH by considering the hydrolysis reaction. Let me try to set up the equation.

Let x be the concentration of H+ produced per liter. Wait, but each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+ ions. So the hydrolysis reaction produces 3 H+ per Fe^3+.

But wait, the initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M. Let's denote the change as follows:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+
Initial (M): 0.009358    0            0
Change: -y               +y           +3y
Equilibrium: 0.009358 - y, y, 3y.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the stoichiometry is 1 Fe^3+ gives 3 H+.

Wait, perhaps I should let x be the concentration of Fe(OH)3 produced. Then, [H+] = 3x, and the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 - x.

But considering that x is likely very small compared to 0.009358, we can approximate 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358.

So K = (x)(3x)^3 / (0.009358) = (x)(27x^3) / 0.009358 = (27 x^4 ) / 0.009358.

But what is K? I'm a bit stuck here because I don't remember the exact K value for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can find K using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is given by Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. Let's say that in pure water, the solubility (s) of Fe(OH)3 is such that [Fe^3+] = s and [OH^-] = 3s. So Ksp = s*(3s)^3 = 27 s^4. So Ksp = 27 s^4.

I think the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.0 x 10^-38. So 6e-38 = 27 s^4 → s^4 = 6e-38 / 27 ≈ 2.222e-39 → s ≈ (2.222e-39)^(1/4). Let me compute that.

What's the fourth root of 2.222e-39? Well, 1e-36 is (1e-9)^4. 2.222e-39 is 2.222e-3 * 1e-36. So the fourth root would be (2.222e-3)^(1/4) * 1e-9.

Wait, 2.222e-3 is 0.002222. The fourth root of that is approximately 0.002222^(0.25). Let's calculate that.

0.002222 is 2.222e-3. The square root is around 0.04714, and square root again is about 0.0686. So around 6.86e-2 * 1e-9 = 6.86e-11 M. So s ≈6.86e-11 M. So in pure water, Fe(OH)3 dissolves to give [Fe^3+] ≈6.86e-11 M and [OH^-] ≈2.058e-10 M.

But in our case, the solution is much more concentrated. So the solubility in this case is different because the solution is acidic, which shifts the dissolution equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the K for the hydrolysis reaction in terms of Ksp and the acid dissociation.

Wait, let's consider the hydrolysis reaction again: Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But what is K in terms of Ksp?

Wait, Ksp is for Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3OH^-.

We can write the hydrolysis as Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+, so that's the reverse of the Ksp reaction but with H+ instead of OH-.

Wait, perhaps we can write Ksp as [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

In the hydrolysis equation, [OH^-] is from water. But in an acidic solution, [OH^-] is low, so perhaps we can relate H+ and OH- via Kw.

So, Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14 at 25°C.

So [OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+].

Substituting into Ksp: [Fe^3+][ (1e-14/[H+]) ]^3 = 6e-38.

So [Fe^3+] = (6e-38) * [H+]^3 / (1e-42) ) = (6e-38 / 1e-42) ) [H+]^3 = 6e4 [H+]^3.

Wait, that's [Fe^3+] = 6e4 [H+]^3.

But in our case, [Fe^3+] is 0.009358 M. So 0.009358 = 6e4 * [H+]^3.

Wait, solving for [H+]^3: [H+]^3 = 0.009358 / (6e4) = 9.358e-3 / 6e4 = approx 1.5597e-7.

So [H+] = cube root of 1.5597e-7.

Cube root of 1e-7 is about 4.64e-3. 1.5597 is about 1.56, so cube root of 1.56 is about 1.16. So 1.16 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.41e-3 M.

Wait, that's H+ concentration. So pH = -log(5.41e-3) ≈ 2.266.

Wait, but wait a second, let's do that calculation more accurately.

Wait, [H+]^3 = 0.009358 / (6e4) → 0.009358 / 60000 = 0.009358 /6e4 = 9.358e-3 /6e4 = 1.5597e-7.

Taking cube root: 1.5597e-7 → approximately 5.39e-3 M.

So pH = -log(5.39e-3) → log(5.39e-3) = log(5.39) + log(1e-3) → log(5.39) ≈ 0.7319, so total is 0.7319 -3 → -2.2681 → pH ≈ 2.268.

But wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again. Because I think I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, [H+]^3 = (0.009358) / (6e4) → 0.009358 is 9.358e-3.

Wait, 9.358e-3 /6e4 = (9.358 /6) * 1e-7 → approx 1.5597 * 1e-7 → 1.5597e-7.

So cube root is (1.5597e-7)^(1/3). Let me compute that more accurately.

Cube root of 1.5597e-7 is same as cube root of 1.5597 multiplied by cube root of 1e-7.

Cube root of 1.5597 is about 1.16, because 1.16^3=1.56 (1.16 *1.16=1.3456, *1.16 ≈ 1.56).

Cube root of 1e-7 is 1e-2.333..., because (1e-7) = 1e-21/3 → 1e-7. So, 1e-7^(1/3) = 1e- (7/3) → 1e-2.333... = approx 4.64e-3.

So 1.16 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.39e-3 M. So [H+] is about 5.39e-3 M, so pH is about 2.266.

Looking at the options, none of them have a pH around 2.27. Let's see the options again.

Option C: pH 2.04; volume 28.05 cm^3.

Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm^3.

Hmm, my calculation gave pH about 2.27, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction produces H+ ions, but the solution also comes from the acid added. Wait, the acid used is HCl, a strong acid, which would contribute a lot of H+ ions. Wait a minute, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier in my approach.

Wait, when you add HCl to Fe(OH)3, the reaction is neutralization, producing FeCl3 and water. The HCl provides H+ ions which neutralize the OH- in Fe(OH)3.

So the moles of H+ from HCl required to neutralize Fe(OH)3 are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. Oh wait, but when you add HCl, it's a strong acid; it dissociates completely. So after the neutralization, the solution contains FeCl3, which is a strong electrolyte, so it will dissociate completely into Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions.

But the solution also contains excess H+ from the strong acid that was added. Wait, because the HCl added is in excess beyond just neutralizing the Fe(OH)3. Wait, no. Wait, in the problem, it says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare the solution." So I think the acid is just enough to neutralize the Fe(OH)3, not in excess. Because if you add only the amount needed for neutralization, then the solution would just contain FeCl3, which is a weak acid (since Fe^3+ hydrolyzes). But if you add more acid, the solution would be more acidic, but the minimum volume is the stoichiometric amount needed for neutralization.

Wait, no. Wait, when you add a strong acid to a hydroxide, I think the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So the H+ comes from the acid. So the moles of H+ needed is 3 times moles of Fe(OH)3.

Earlier, I calculated that to be about 0.0028075 moles, requiring 28.075 cm^3 of 0.1 M HCl. So that's correct.

But wait, after adding exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid (HCl) needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, the solution will contain FeCl3. But that's a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, so it will hydrolyze to produce an acidic solution. So the pH depends on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So my earlier approach is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the K calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it using the hydrolysis equilibrium more carefully.

Wait, another approach: The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as a reaction where Fe^3+ donates a proton. The hydrolysis produces H+ ions, which make the solution acidic.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M. Let me denote [H+] as x. But each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+ per molecule, so perhaps the relationship is more complex.

Wait, but the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = ([Fe(OH)3][H+]^3) / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K. So perhaps I can find K using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and the K of water's ion product.

Wait, since Fe(OH)3 is sparingly soluble, the Ksp is known, but in the hydrolysis reaction, Fe(OH)3 is a product, so perhaps the K for hydrolysis is K = Kw^3/(Ksp) ?

Wait, let me think. The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

The autoionization of water is H2O ↔ H+ + OH- with Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So, from Ksp, [Fe^3+] = Ksp / [OH^-]^3.

In the hydrolysis reaction, [H+] is related to [OH^-] by Kw = [H+][OH^-] → [OH^-] = Kw/[H+].

Substituting into [Fe^3+] from Ksp: [Fe^3+] = Ksp / ( (Kw/[H+])^3 ) ) = Ksp * [H+]^3 / Kw^3.

So [Fe^3+] = (Ksp / Kw^3) * [H+]^3.

Wait, that's an expression for [Fe^3+] in terms of [H+].

Wait, but in our case, [Fe^3+] is 0.009358 M, so:

0.009358 = (Ksp / (Kw^3)) ) * [H+]^3.

We can solve for [H+]^3.

Given that Ksp is 6e-38 and Kw is 1e-14.

So Ksp/Kw^3 = (6e-38) / ( (1e-14)^3 ) ) = 6e-38 / 1e-42 = 6e4.

So 0.009358 = 6e4 * [H+]^3 → [H+]^3 = 0.009358 / 6e4 = 9.358e-3 /6e4 = 1.5597e-7 → [H+] = cube root of 1.5597e-7 ≈5.39e-3 M.

So pH is -log(5.39e-3) ≈ 2.266.

But the options don't have a pH around 2.27. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm^3. Option B is pH 2.69 and 30.09 cm^3.

Hmm, my calculation is about 2.27, which isn't matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in Ksp value. Maybe I got the Ksp wrong.

Wait, I think I might have used the wrong Ksp value. Let me check: I thought Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is around 6e-38, but perhaps it's a different order of magnitude. Let me see.

Wait, I recall that Fe(OH)3 has a Ksp around 6.0e-38, which is what I used. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe my assumption that the hydrolysis reaction's K is Ksp/Kw^3 is incorrect. Or perhaps I set up the equation wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's write the hydrolysis as Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But from Ksp, [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = Ksp → [Fe^3+] = Ksp / [OH^-]^3.

In the hydrolysis equation, substitute [Fe^3+] with Ksp/[OH^-]^3, and [OH^-] = Kw/[H+].

So:

K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / ( Ksp / [OH^-]^3 )

= [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 [OH^-]^3 / Ksp.

But [Fe(OH)3] is the concentration of the solid, which is constant, so it can be considered as part of K. Alternatively, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of [H+].

Let me try again.

We have [Fe^3+] = (Ksp) / [OH^-]^3.

But [OH^-] = Kw / [H+], so:

[Fe^3+] = (Ksp) / ( (Kw/[H+])^3 ) ) = (Ksp * [H+]^3) / (Kw^3).

So, [Fe^3+] = (Ksp / Kw^3) * [H+]^3.

But in our case, [Fe^3+] is 0.009358 M.

So 0.009358 = (6e-38 / (1e-14)^3) ) * [H+]^3.

Wait, (1e-14)^3 is 1e-42. So 6e-38 / 1e-42 = 6e4.

So 0.009358 = 6e4 * [H+]^3 → [H+]^3 = 0.009358 / 6e4 = 1.5597e-7.

So [H+] ≈ (1.5597e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.39e-3 → pH ≈2.266.

But again, that's not matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the acid is just enough to neutralize Fe(OH)3. Wait! Wait a second. Because when you add a strong acid to Fe(OH)3, the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

But the solution's pH depends on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+, but the acid added (HCl) contributes to the H+ concentration beyond what's needed for neutralization. Wait, no—because if you add exactly the required amount of H+ (stoichiometric), then the solution would have no excess H+ from the acid, only that from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But if you add more acid, then there would be excess H+ from the acid, making the solution more acidic.

Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So that would imply adding exactly the amount needed for neutralization. So the solution would have Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions, and the pH is due solely to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But according to my earlier calculation, the pH is around 2.27, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate [H+] again. Let's compute 1.5597e-7^(1/3) accurately.

The cube of 5e-3 is 1.25e-6. Wait, 5e-3 is 0.005. 0.005^3 = 1.25e-7.

Wait, 5.39e-3: 5.39^3 is approximately 156. So 5.39e-3^3 = (5.39)^3 * 1e-9 → 156 *1e-9 = 1.56e-7. Which matches 1.5597e-7.

So [H+] is approximately 5.39e-3 M. So pH is -log(5.39e-3) → which is approximately 2.266.

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different Ksp value. Let me check if Fe(OH)3's Ksp is 6e-38 or 6e-37. Because if Ksp is 6e-37, then the calculation would change.

Wait, if Ksp is 6e-37, then Ksp/Kw^3 = 6e-37 / 1e-42 = 6e5.

Then [H+]^3 = 0.009358 / 6e5 = 0.009358 /600000 = 1.5597e-8.

Cube root of 1.5597e-8 is approximately 2.5e-3, because (2.5e-3)^3 is 1.5625e-8.

So [H+] ≈ 2.5e-3 → pH ≈ 2.6.

Which is close to option B's pH of 2.69.

But I thought Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38. Perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. I think it's about 6.0×10^-38.

So perhaps the correct pH is around 2.27, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that after neutralization, the solution has both Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the strong acid. No, wait, the minimum volume is just enough to neutralize, so no excess H+.

Or perhaps the mistake is in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles: mass is 0.1g. Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol,

O: 16.00 g/mol,

H: 1.008 g/mol.

So Fe(OH)3: 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.845 +3*(17.008)=55.845 +51.024=106.869 g/mol.

Moles = 0.1 /106.869 ≈ 0.0009358 mol → correct.

So the moles of H+ needed is 3 * 0.0009358 = 0.0028074 mol.

Volume of HCl: 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L → 28.074 cm³ → which matches option C's volume of 28.05 cm³.

So the volume part is correct. Now, the pH part must be incorrect. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is not completely neutralized. But no, because the question states to dissolve it, implying complete neutralization.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution volume isn't 100 cm³. Because when you add the HCl, the total volume may increase. But the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume after adding HCl is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the problem says: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume."

Wait, that's ambiguous. It could mean that the total solution volume is 100 cm³ after adding the acid. Or perhaps the volume of the solution is 100 cm³, which includes the acid added.

Wait, the problem states: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So when I calculated the moles of H+ required, I assumed that the solution's volume is 100 cm³. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, in my earlier calculation, I considered the FeCl3 concentration as 0.009358 /0.1 → because moles / volume in liters.

So that part is correct.

So back to the pH. If my calculation is giving a pH around 2.27, but the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ but also from the excess H+ from the acid. But the question says it's the minimum volume, so the acid is exactly the required amount to neutralize Fe(OH)3. So no excess H+ from HCl.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrolysis approach. Let me think of another way.

Let me consider that FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte and dissociates completely: FeCl3 → Fe^3+ + 3Cl^-.

The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

Let me denote the change as x. So at equilibrium:

Fe^3+: 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358 (since x is small).

H+: 3x.

Fe(OH)3: x.

So K for the reaction is:

K = (x)(3x)^3 / (0.009358) = (27x^4) / 0.009358.

But what is K? It's the same as the hydrolysis constant, which I don't have.

Wait, but I can find K using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and Kw.

We have the equation for Fe(OH)3 dissolution:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- → Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

In the hydrolysis, Fe^3+ produces H+ and Fe(OH)3.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction would be:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But from the Ksp equation, [Fe^3+] = Ksp / [OH^-]^3.

Substituting into K's expression:

K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) * [OH^-]^3 / Ksp.

But [Fe(OH)3] is the concentration of the solid, which is a constant, so it can be considered part of K. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express K in terms of Kw.

Wait, [OH^-] = Kw / [H+]. So:

K = [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 [OH^-]^3 / Ksp.

= [Fe(OH)3] ( [H+][OH^-] )^3 / Ksp.

But [H+][OH^-] = Kw, so:

K = [Fe(OH)3] (Kw)^3 / Ksp.

But [Fe(OH)3] is the solubility, which is same as x in our earlier setup. But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write:

K = (Kw^3) / Ksp.

Because:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3/[Fe^3+] = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) * ([OH^-]^3 / [OH^-]^3 ) / [Fe^3+] )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps K is Kw^3 / Ksp.

So K = (1e-14)^3 / (6e-38) ) = 1e-42 / 6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = approximately 1.6667e-5.

So K ≈1.6667e-5.

So K = (27 x^4) / 0.009358 = 1.6667e-5.

So 27 x^4 = 1.6667e-5 * 0.009358 → 1.6667e-5 * 9.358e-3 = approx 1.563e-7.

So x^4 = 1.563e-7 / 27 → 5.789e-9.

x = (5.789e-9)^(1/4) → approx cube root of sqrt(5.789e-9). Wait, square root of 5.789e-9 is about 7.609e-5. Cube root of that is approx 4.24e-2. So x ≈ (5.789e-9)^(1/4) → let me compute that accurately.

Wait, 5.789e-9 is 5.789 * 1e-9.

The fourth root of 5.789 is about 1.55, and fourth root of 1e-9 is 1e-2.25 → 5.623e-3.

So x ≈1.55 *5.623e-3 ≈ 8.72e-3.

Wait, wait, but this is x, which is the concentration of Fe(OH)3 produced. Then [H+] =3x → 3 *8.72e-3 ≈ 0.02616 M.

So [H+]≈0.02616 M → pH = -log(0.02616) ≈ 1.58.

Wait, that's about pH 1.58, which is even lower than before. But that can't be right, as the options don't have that. So perhaps I messed up the calculation of K.

Wait, wait, K is Kw^3 / Ksp. Let me compute that again.

Kw is 1e-14. Kw^3 = (1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp is 6e-38. So Kw^3/Ksp = 1e-42 /6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = 1.6667e-5.

So K ≈1.6667e-5.

So back to the equation:

27 x^4 = K * [Fe^3+] → 27 x^4 =1.6667e-5 * 0.009358.

Compute 1.6667e-5 * 0.009358:

1.6667e-5 * 9.358e-3 = (1.6667 *9.358) ) e-8 → 15.63e-8 → 1.563e-7.

So 27 x^4 = 1.563e-7 → x^4 = 1.563e-7 /27 → 5.789e-9.

x = (5.789e-9)^(1/4) → let's calculate this.

Take the natural log: ln(5.789e-9) ≈ ln(5.789) + (-9)*ln(10) → approx 1.756 + (-9)*2.3026 → 1.756 -20.723 → -18.967.

Divide by 4: -4.74175.

Exponentiate: e^-4.74175 ≈ 8.7e-3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5.789e-9 is a very small number. Let me compute the fourth root accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

The fourth root of 5.789e-9 is the same as (5.789e-9)^(0.25).

I'll compute it as:

Take the square root twice.

First sqrt(5.789e-9) → sqrt(5.789) is about 2.406, so 2.406e-4.5 → no, wait, sqrt(5.789e-9) = sqrt(5.789) * 1e-4.5 → 2.406 * 3.162e-5 → approximately 7.609e-5.

Then sqrt(7.609e-5) → sqrt(7.609) is about 2.758, and sqrt(1e-5) is 1e-2.5 → 3.162e-3.

So 2.758 * 3.162e-3 ≈ 8.72e-3.

So x ≈8.72e-3 M.

Then [H+] = 3x ≈0.02616 M → pH = -log(0.02616) ≈ 1.58.

But this is way lower than any of the options. So perhaps my approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for weak acid hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I should model Fe^3+ as a weak acid with a certain K value. Let me think: Fe^3+ can act as an acid, donating protons. The reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

The K for this reaction would be K = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+]/[Fe^3+].

But I don't know this K value. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it from the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and other known constants.

Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 =6e-38.

The hydrolysis reaction can be linked to the Ksp and the autoionization of water.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis can be considered in steps. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be calculated using the formula for a salt of a weak base and a strong acid.

The formula is pH = ½ (pKa - log C), but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, another approach: the solution contains Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes to produce H+.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3/[Fe^3+].

But I don't know K. If I can find K, I can solve for [H+].

Alternatively, using the relation K = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 =6e-38.

So [OH^-]^3 = Ksp/[Fe^3+] → [OH^-] = (Ksp/[Fe^3+])^(1/3).

Then, [H+] = Kw/[OH^-] → [H+] = Kw / ( (Ksp/[Fe^3+])^(1/3) ) ) = Kw^(1) * ( [Fe^3+]^(1/3) ) / ( Ksp^(1/3) )

So [H+] = (Kw^3 * [Fe^3+] )^(1/3) / Ksp^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me plug in the numbers.

Kw =1e-14.

[Fe^3+] =0.009358 M.

Ksp =6e-38.

So [OH^-] = (6e-38 / 0.009358 )^(1/3).

Compute 6e-38 / 0.009358 → 6e-38 /9.358e-3 → approx 6.407e-36.

[OH^-] = (6.407e-36 )^(1/3) → cube root of 6.407e-36.

Cube root of 6.407 is about 1.858, and cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12.

So [OH^-] ≈1.858e-12 M.

Then [H+] = Kw/[OH^-] =1e-14 / 1.858e-12 → approximately 5.38e-3 M.

So pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈2.266.

Again, same result as before. So perhaps the answer should be around pH 2.27, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is not given, but among the options, the closest is option C (pH 2.04) or option B (2.69).

But according to the calculations, the volume is approximately 28.05 cm³, which matches option C's volume. However, the pH isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me double-check the reaction.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ +3H2O. So 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g /106.87g/mol ≈0.0009358 mol.

Moles of H+: 3 * 0.0009358 =0.0028075 mol.

Volume of HCl (0.1 M): 0.0028075 / 0.1 =0.028075 L → 28.075 cm³. So that's correct.

So the volume part is correct for option C.

But pH is not matching any option. So perhaps the mistake is in the Ksp value. Let me see if Fe(OH)3's Ksp is different.

Wait, I think I might have the Ksp value wrong. Let me check again. Actually, the correct Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6.0×10^-38.

Wait, but another source says Ksp is 1.6e-38. Let me try with Ksp=1.6e-38.

So Ksp=1.6e-38.

Then, K = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 /1.6e-38 =1e-42 /1.6e-38 =6.25e-5.

So K=6.25e-5.

Then, K =27x^4 / 0.009358 → 6.25e-5 = 27x^4 /0.009358 → 27x^4=6.25e-5 *0.009358 →approx 5.849e-7 → x^4=5.849e-7 /27 →2.167e-8.

x= (2.167e-8)^(1/4) → sqrt(sqrt(2.167e-8)).

sqrt(2.167e-8) is about 4.655e-4. Then sqrt(4.655e-4) is about 0.02158.

Wait, [H+] =3x= 3 *0.02158=0.0647 M → pH=-log(0.0647)=1.19.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ksp is 1.1e-34, which I've seen in some references.

Wait, let me try Ksp=1.1e-34.

K = (1e-14)^3 /1.1e-34 =1e-42 /1.1e-34 ≈9.09e-9.

Then, K=27x^4/(0.009358) →9.09e-9 = 27x^4/(0.009358) →27x^4=9.09e-9 *0.009358 ≈8.48e-11 →x^4=8.48e-11/27 →3.139e-12.

x= (3.139e-12)^(1/4) → cube root of square root.

sqrt(3.139e-12)= approx 5.6e-6. sqrt(5.6e-6)= ~2.37e-3.

[H+]=3x=7.11e-3 → pH=-log(7.11e-3)=2.146.

Which is close to option B's pH of 2.69, but not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Let's think of the solution as a hydrolysis of Fe^3+ leading to [H+]= sqrt(3*Kw*C), where C is concentration. But I'm not sure about this approach.

Wait, perhaps we can use the formula for a hydrolysis of a salt of a weak base:

pH = ½ (pKw - pKb + pC), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the pH calculation might not match any option, but the volume part is correct, so the correct option is C: 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But my calculation is pH around 2.27, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but due to a miscalculation in Ksp, the pH comes out to 2.04.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the Fe^3+ solution is a weak acid and calculate the pH using the formula for a weak acid.

The formula is [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C), but this assumes that Ka is much smaller than C, which is not always the case.

But I don't know Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation:

Ka = Kw^3 / Ksp.

So Ka = (1e-14)^3 /6e-38 →1e-42 /6e-38 → 1.6667e-5.

So Ka=1.6667e-5.

Then, for a solution of Fe^3+ at 0.009358 M, the [H+] can be found using the formula for a weak acid:

Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA].

But Fe^3+ is the acid, so HA is Fe^3+, A- is Fe(OH)^2+, and H+ is from water.

But the reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

So for this reaction, Ka = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+]/[Fe^3+].

Assuming that x is much smaller than initial concentration, [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.009358.

So:

Ka ≈ x^2 / 0.009358 → x^2 = Ka *0.009358 → x = sqrt(1.6667e-5 *0.009358).

Compute 1.6667e-5 * 0.009358 →1.6667e-5 *9.358e-3 →1.563e-7.

x = sqrt(1.563e-7) → approx 1.25e-3. So [H+] =1.25e-3 → pH=2.90.

But this doesn't match any option either.

I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should look at the options again. The volume part is 28.05 cm³, which is option C. The pH part in option C is 2.04, which is lower than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is not only FeCl3 but also some excess HCl. But that would require adding more than the stoichiometric amount of HCl, which isn't the case here since we're looking for the minimum volume.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer solution, but that's not the case here because Fe(OH)3 is fully neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximations.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3/[Fe^3+] = (Kw^3)/Ksp.

So, K = (1e-14)^3 /6e-38 =1e-42/6e-38=1.6667e-5.

So,

1.6667e-5 = ( (x) (3x)^3 )/(0.009358 - x ).

Assuming x is small compared to 0.009358, we can approximate 0.009358 -x ≈0.009358.

So,

1.6667e-5 ≈ (x *27x^3)/0.009358 → 27x^4 = 1.6667e-5 *0.009358 →27x^4= 1.563e-7 → x^4=5.789e-9 →x= (5.789e-9)^(1/4)= approx 8.72e-3.

So [H+] =3x=0.02616 M → pH=1.58.

Again, this doesn't match any option. I'm clearly missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not 100 cm³ yet. Because when you add the HCl, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.0009358 mol /0.1 L = 0.009358 M, which I used.

Alternatively, perhaps the HCl is 0.1 M, but when you add V cm³ of it, the total volume becomes (100 + V) cm³, but the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, implying V is the only volume, so the total volume is 100 cm³. So my earlier approach is correct.

Hmm. Given that I'm stuck and the time I've spent, perhaps I should choose the option that matches the volume calculation and see what the pH would be.

The volume is 28.05 cm³, which is option C.

The pH calculated by me is around 2.27, but option C has pH 2.04. So perhaps the correct answer is C.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a strong monobasic acid (e.g., HCl) is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.87 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.87} \approx 0.0009358 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of H⁺ required
From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are required per mole of Fe(OH)₃. Thus:
\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.0009358 \approx 0.0028075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate volume of 0.1 M HCl required
The volume of 0.1 M HCl needed is:
\[
\text{Volume (cm}^3\text{)} = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Molarity of HCl}} = \frac{0.0028075}{0.1} \approx 28.075 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]
This matches the volume in **Option C**.

### Step 4: Calculate pH of the resulting solution
After neutralization, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+.
\]
The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3}{\text{Total volume (L)}} = \frac{0.0009358}{0.1} \approx 0.009358 \, \text{M}.
\]

The equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ is related to the solubility product (\(K_{sp}\)) of Fe(OH)₃ and the ion product of water (\(K_w\)):
\[
K = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{sp}}.
\]
Given \(K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14}\) and \(K_{sp} = 6 \times 10^{-38}\), we calculate:
\[
K = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-14})^3}{6 \times 10^{-38}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-42}}{6 \times 10^{-38}} \approx 1.67 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Using the hydrolysis equilibrium:
\[
K = \frac{[\text{Fe(OH)}_3][\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]},
\]
and assuming \([\text{Fe(OH)}_3] \ll [\text{Fe}^{3+}]\), we approximate:
\[
K \approx \frac{[\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]}.
\]
Substituting values:
\[
1.67 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^3}{0.009358}.
\]
Solving for \([\text{H}^+]\):
\[
[\text{H}^+]^3 = (1.67 \times 10^{-5})(0.009358) \approx 1.563 \times 10^{-7}.
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] = (1.563 \times 10^{-7})^{1/3} \approx 5.39 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log(5.39 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.27.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated volume of 28.075 cm³ matches **Option C**. However, the calculated pH of 2.27 does not match any option exactly. Among the given options, **Option C** provides the closest match for the volume and a reasonable pH value of 2.04.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
