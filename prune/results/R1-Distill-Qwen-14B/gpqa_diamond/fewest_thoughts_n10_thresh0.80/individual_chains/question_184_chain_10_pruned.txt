Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which reaction sequence will lead to the desired product: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I should probably sketch the structure to understand it better. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering? In benzene, the numbering starts such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, if it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro, that would look like a meta arrangement for some of them, but I need to be precise.

Wait, let me think. The substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, it's a tri-substituted benzene with substituents in the 1, 2, 3 positions. Hmm.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So, I need to perform a series of reactions to introduce these substituents in the correct positions.

The main reactions I'm considering are electrophilic substitution reactions, such as nitration, sulfonation, alkylation, and perhaps some elimination or substitution reactions.

Let me outline the substituents needed:

- Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1.
- tert-Butyl group (C(CH3)3) at position 2.
- Nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.

Wait, but wait. The product is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me imagine the ring: positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent to each other. So, the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, all three substituents are meta to each
