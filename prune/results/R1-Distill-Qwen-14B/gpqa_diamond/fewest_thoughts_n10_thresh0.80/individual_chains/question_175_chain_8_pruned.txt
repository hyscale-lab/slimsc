Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the function f, which depends on wavelength and angle.

The problem says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. That probably means the radiation pattern has some symmetry too. I think for dipole radiation, the pattern is a function of the angle theta from the dipole's axis.

Wait, the maximum power is A. So the power radiated at any angle theta is a fraction of A. The question is asking what fraction is radiated at theta=30 degrees and what the form of f is.

I remember that for a dipole radiator, the power pattern is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) or something like that. But wait, is that the case for the far field (radiation zone)? Yes, in the far field, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by P proportional to (sin^2(theta)) or maybe (1 + cos^2(theta))?

Wait, I think the radiation intensity for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (2 + 2 cos²θ), but normalized. Alternatively, the function could be f(θ) ∝ sin²θ. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Wait, let me think. The dipole radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has an intensity that varies with angle. For a dipole aligned along the z-axis, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole (θ = 90 degrees) and minimum along the axis (θ=0 and 180). The exact form is I ∝ (2 + 2 cos²θ) which simplifies to I ∝ sin²θ? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the electric field of a dipole in the far field is E ∝ (1/r) * (sinθ e_r + cosθ e_θ) or something like that. The intensity, which is |E|^2, would then have terms involving sin^2θ and cos^2θ. So the intensity pattern should be maximum at θ=90 degrees because sinθ is 1 there, and minimum at θ=0 and 180.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recall the exact expression. The intensity for a dipole is given by I = ( ( p^2 ω^4 ) / (4 π ε0 c^3 r^2 ) ) * ( (1 + cos²θ) ) / 2. So the intensity is proportional to (1 + cos²θ). So for θ=30 degrees, cosθ is sqrt(3)/2, so cos^2θ is 3/4. So the intensity at θ=30 is (1 + 3/4 ) = 7/4 divided by 2? Wait, no, because the expression is (1 + cos²θ)/2. So 1 + (3/4) = 7/4, divided by 2 gives 7/8.
