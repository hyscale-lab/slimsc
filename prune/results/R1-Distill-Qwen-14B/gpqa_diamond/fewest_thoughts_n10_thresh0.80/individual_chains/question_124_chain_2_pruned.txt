Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, so the main thing here is probably the relationship between the particles' speed (or their Lorentz factor) and the distance they travel before decaying. Because particles decay, only a fraction of them make it to the detector's walls. The problem must be about the time it takes for the particles to reach the walls versus the time they take to decay.

Wait, right, in particle physics, the lifetime of a particle as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, and the observed lifetime is gamma times tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, the particles' lifetime is gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime.

But how does this relate to the distance they can travel? Well, the distance is velocity multiplied by time. At ultra-relativistic speeds, the velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance, L, that a particle travels before decaying is approximately c multiplied by gamma times tau. 

Wait, but in this problem, the particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel to reach the inner walls is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters.

So, particles that live longer (have a larger gamma) will have a higher chance of reaching the walls. Because the further they can go, the more likely they are to reach the detector's edge before decaying.

But wait, the problem says that when the Lorentz factor is 20, only one third of the particles reach the walls. So, when the Lorentz factor increases, more particles should reach the walls. Because their lifetime is longer, so they have a higher chance of reaching the 30-meter mark.

So the question is, what gamma would result in two
