Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods have a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We're supposed to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming the same albedo for all.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L)/(16πσ) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ) * (1/r)^(1/2), but maybe I can simplify it. Wait, another way: the equilibrium temperature scales with the square root of ( (1 - albedo) / (distance^2) ), but since all planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out. So the main factor is the distance.

But wait, how does the orbital period relate to the distance? Oh, Kepler's third law! The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P^2 ∝ a^3. So a ∝ P^(2/3). 

So the distance is proportional to P^(2/3), right? So to find the ratio of the distances between Planet_4 and Planet_2, I can take their period ratios to the (2/3) power.

The periods are given as 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5 for the five planets. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, Planet_3 is 2.5*P1, Planet_4 is 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is 5*P1.

Wait, no, the ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, meaning each planet's period is that multiple of the first planet. So Planet_2's period is 2 units, Planet_4 is 3.5 units. So the ratio of their periods is P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

Since a ∝ P^(2/3
