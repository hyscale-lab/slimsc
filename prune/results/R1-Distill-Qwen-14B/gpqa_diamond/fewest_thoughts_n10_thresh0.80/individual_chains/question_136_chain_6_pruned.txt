Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm, I've studied some vector calculus before, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll need to recall the relevant concepts.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². Wait, radially means it's pointing along the radius, right? So in spherical coordinates, the field has components only in the radial direction and zero elsewhere. So f(r) is a vector that points radially outward or inward, depending on the sign, but the magnitude is 1/r².

The question is about finding the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So I need to compute ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of the sphere.

I remember that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. The divergence theorem states that ∫∫∫ (∇ · F) dV = ∫∫ F · n dA, where n is the outward normal vector to the surface. So here, the volume integral of divergence equals the flux through the surface of the sphere.

Wait, but in this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R, so the surface is a sphere of radius R. So if I can compute the flux through that surface, I can find the volume integral.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the divergence directly. Let's think about that.

In spherical coordinates, for a vector field that depends only on r and is purely radial, the divergence is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r), where F_r is the radial component of the field. Since in this case, F is f(r), and it's radial, so F_r = 1/r², and the other components F_θ and F_φ are zero.

So, let's compute the divergence. So,

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r )

f_r is 1/r², so plug that in:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Simplify inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) = 1. So,

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (1) 

The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = 0.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin where r=0. Because at r=0, the function isn't defined. So f(r) has a singularity at the origin. That might mean we need to think about this
