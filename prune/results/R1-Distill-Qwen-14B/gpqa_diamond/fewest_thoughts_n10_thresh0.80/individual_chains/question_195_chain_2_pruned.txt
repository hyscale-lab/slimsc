Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

So, the setup is that there's a star with 1.5 times the Sun's radius. A planet with Earth's radius is orbiting this star in a circular path. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the planet's orbital period is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet, which has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm. Wait, transit and occultation events. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose the planet's light (if it's reflecting or emitting, like in infrared). For both events to happen, the planet must pass both in front and behind the star relative to us. But how does that relate to orbital periods?

I think it's about orbital periods and the possibility that the second planet can both transit and be occulted. Wait, but for the second planet to be occulted, it must be behind the star from our perspective. So the two planets' orbital periods must be such that their orbital positions allow this. Maybe the second planet's orbital period is longer than the first, but not too much longer.

Wait, wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the orbital periods and the alignment of the planets. For both transits and occultations to be possible, the second planet must sometimes be in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). But how does the orbital period of the second planet affect this?

Oh, right! The transit and occultation events happen when the two planets are in conjunction and opposition with respect to each other as seen from Earth. So, the orbital periods of the two planets must be such that these positions are possible within the same system.

Wait, but the problem says the second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation events. So for that planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star. And for it to be occulted, the planet must pass behind the star. Both events require that the planet's orbit allows it to be in those positions relative to the star and
