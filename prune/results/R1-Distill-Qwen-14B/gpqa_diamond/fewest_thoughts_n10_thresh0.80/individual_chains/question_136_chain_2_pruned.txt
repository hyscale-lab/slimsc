Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r). The field falls off radially as 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. The integral is over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface of the field. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

Wait, but wait. The divergence theorem says that ∫(∇·f) dV = ∫(f · n) dA, where n is the outward unit normal vector on the surface. So if I can compute this flux, I don't have to compute the divergence and integrate it everywhere inside.

But in this case, f(r) is given as having a magnitude of 1/r² and only radial component. So in spherical coordinates, f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, because it's only radial and the magnitude is 1/r². 

So the flux through the sphere would be f · n multiplied by the surface area. But n is the radial unit vector, which is the same as r̂. So f · n is the radial component of f, which is (1/r²) r̂ · r̂ = 1/r².

Wait, but wait, the radius of the sphere is R. So on the surface of the sphere (r = R), the magnitude of f is 1/R², and it's pointing radially outward, same as n. So the flux is f(r) * R² (because the area element on a sphere is R² sinθ dθ dφ, but when multiplied by the component, it's (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ).

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The flux is ∫ f · n dA over the sphere. Since f is radial and n is the same as f's direction at the surface, the dot product is just f(r) at the surface times the area element.

So f at r=R is (1/R²) r̂. The surface area element in spherical coordinates is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So the flux becomes ∫ [ (1/R²) r̂ · r̂ ] * R² sinθ dθ dφ. Since r̂ · r̂ is 1, this simplifies to ∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ = ∫ sinθ dθ dφ. 

Wait, integrating sinθ dθ from 0 to π gives 2, and integrating dφ from 0 to 2π gives 2π. So 2 * 2π = 4π. So the flux is 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, this flux is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of f. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π. So the answer should be 4π, which is option A.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is the vector field f(r) = (1/r²) r̂? Because sometimes, when dealing with fields like the electric field of a point charge, the divergence isn't zero except at the origin. Oh wait, but f(r) here is given, and
