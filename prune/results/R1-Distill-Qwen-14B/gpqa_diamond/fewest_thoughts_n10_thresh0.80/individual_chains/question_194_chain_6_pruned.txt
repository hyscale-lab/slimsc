Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE) where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, let me think. Each spin has two possible states, +1 and -1. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. I need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each to find the partition function.

But maybe there's a smarter way than brute-forcing all 8 states. Let me think about the symmetry of the problem. The energy depends on the product of pairs of spins. So the energy depends on how many pairs are aligned or anti-aligned.

Wait, each term in the energy is S_i S_j. If S_i and S_j are the same, their product is +1. If different, it's -1. So each S_i S_j term is either +1 or -1. The energy is -J times the sum of these three terms.

So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me define each term as a product. Let me calculate each possible state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider how many pairs are aligned. Because each pair contributes either +1 or -1. Let me think about the possible values of the sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote this sum as H. So H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

I should find all possible values of H for all possible spin configurations.

Each spin is ±1, so each of the three terms in H can be ±1.

Wait, let's think about the possible cases. How can the sum H vary?

But wait, perhaps it's easier to find the possible values of H based on the number of +1 terms. Let me see. H can be -3, -1, +1, +3.

Wait, let's see:

If all three products are +1, H=3 → E = -J *3.

If two products are +1 and one -1, H=1 → E = -J *1.

If one product is +1 and two are -1, H= -1 → E= J*1.

If all three products are -1, H=-3 → E=3J.

Wait, but wait: H is the sum of three terms, each ±1. So the possible H values are 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, no. Let me check:

For example, if all three S are the same, say all +1:

S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1 → H=3.

If two are up, one down, for example S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So H=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Wait, no: 1 -1 -1 = -1. So H is -1.

Similarly, if two are down and one up: Let's see S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3=+1. H = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

Wait, so when all three are same (all up or all down), H=3 or H=-3?

Wait, all down would be S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then each product is (-1)(-1)=+1. So H=3 again. So E
