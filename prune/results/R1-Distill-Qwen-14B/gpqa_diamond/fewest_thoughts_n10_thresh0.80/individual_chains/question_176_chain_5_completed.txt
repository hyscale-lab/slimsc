Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that might not be right. Oh wait, no, wait, the state vector is a column, so the elements are -1, 2, 1, arranged vertically. So it's a 3x1 matrix.

Then there are two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as square matrices. I remember that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (which are the possible measurement outcomes) are real.

The operator P's matrix has first row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

And operator Q's matrix is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). Wait, that's interesting. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. Oh wait, no, wait, because the matrix is diagonal, the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries. So possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The question is: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "just after the measurement of P"—so the order is: first measure P, then measure Q. So the state after measuring P will be an eigenstate of P corresponding to the outcome of that measurement. Then, measuring Q on that new state will give us the outcome for Q.

But wait, no, wait a minute. Let's make sure. The question says: measure Q just after measuring P. So the sequence is: measure P, then measure Q. So the initial state is (-1,2,1) as a column vector. Then someone measures P, which collapses the state to an eigenstate of P. Then, in that new state, they measure Q, which could give another outcome.

But the question is specifically about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So we need to find the probability that when you first measure P, you get 0, and then measuring Q on the resulting state you get -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is first measured with P, and if P gives 0, then the state is projected into the eigenspace of P for eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on that state would have some probabilities. But wait, the state after P=0 measurement is a specific eigenstate of P. Or is it a superposition if the eigenspace is more than one-dimensional?

Hmm, perhaps I should find the eigenvalues of P and their corresponding eigenvectors.

So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of operator P.

Operator P's matrix is:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

We can write this as a matrix:

[ 0      1/√2     0 ]
[1/√2    0      1/√2 ]
[ 0      1/√2    0 ]

I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Let's denote the matrix as P.

The eigenvalues are the solutions to det(P - λI) = 0.

So the characteristic equation is:

| -λ      1/√2      0   |
|1/√2    -λ       1/√2 | = 0
| 0       1/√2    -λ    |

To compute this determinant, I can expand it. Let me write it out.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to use a formula for 3x3 determinants.

Alternatively, perhaps a smarter approach. The matrix P looks symmetric, so it's diagonalizable, and perhaps has some symmetries.

Another approach: notice that the matrix might have a particular structure. For example, perhaps it can be viewed as a tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal, and 1/sqrt(2) on the off-diagonal, but no, wait the diagonal isn't all zeros. Let me recount.

Wait, the (1,1) element is 0, (2,2) is 0, (3,3) is 0. So the diagonal elements are all zero. So the matrix is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix.

In this case, the structure is similar to a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal is zero, and each off-diagonal (immediately above and below the main diagonal) is 1/sqrt(2). So, for a 3x3 matrix, this kind of structure often leads to eigenvalues that are symmetric around zero.

For such matrices, the eigenvalues are known. For a 3x3 matrix with zero diagonal and a on the off-diagonal, the eigenvalues are a*sqrt(2), 0, -a*sqrt(2). Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Wait, for a 3x3 matrix where all off-diagonal elements are a, and diagonal are zero, the eigenvalues are (sqrt(3)) a, 0, and -sqrt(3) a. Let me check.

Wait, in our case, a = 1/sqrt(2). So the eigenvalues would be (sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ), 0, and -(sqrt(3)/sqrt(2)).

Wait, let me compute for a 3x3 matrix where all the off-diagonal elements are a and diagonal are zero.

The matrix would look like:
0 a a
a 0 a
a a 0

The eigenvalues are known for this case. For such a matrix, the eigenvalues are (2a), (-a), (-a). Because the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant is (−a)^2*(2a) − a^3* something? Wait, perhaps a better way is to find the eigenvalues.

But in our case, the matrix isn't exactly like that. Our matrix P has 1/sqrt(2) on the off-diagonal, but in a different pattern.

Wait, no. Wait, in our matrix, the (1,2) and (2,3) elements are 1/sqrt(2), but the (1,3) element is zero. Wait, actually, the structure is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm. So it's not a fully symmetric off-diagonal. So perhaps the eigenvalues are different.

Another approach: perhaps the matrix can be written as a sum of Pauli matrices or something similar, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just compute the determinant.

So the determinant is:

| -λ     (1/√2)   0     |
(1/√2)  -λ     (1/√2) |
0       (1/√2)  -λ     |

So, expanding this determinant:

= -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
    - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 ) ] 
    + 0 [ ... ] (the third term is zero)

So,

= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] 
    - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ) ]
    + 0

= -λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2 )

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ^3 + (λ)/2

Second term: (1/√2)(λ/√2 ) = (1/2) λ

So the determinant is:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ

Set this equal to zero: -λ^3 + λ = 0 ⇒ λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = ±1.

Ah, now that's simpler. So the eigenvalues of P are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, that's interesting. So P can have eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but wait: the determinant was -λ^3 + λ = 0 ⇒ λ(λ² - 1) = 0 → λ = 0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

So when you measure P, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

So first, when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on that state will give the probability for each of Q's eigenvalues.

But wait, our initial state is (-1, 2, 1)^T. We need to find the probabilities.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. Find the eigenstates of P for each eigenvalue, especially for eigenvalue 0.

2. Express the initial state as a linear combination of P's eigenstates. The coefficient of the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue 0 will give the amplitude, and the square modulus gives the probability of measuring 0 when measuring P.

3. Once we have the eigenstate of P (for 0), we can then find the probability of measuring -1 for Q in that state.

Alternatively, perhaps the state after measuring P=0 is an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, when you measure Q, the state is an eigenstate of P, but not necessarily of Q. So we'll need to find the overlap between that state and the eigenstates of Q.

Wait, but let me proceed step by step.

First, let me find the eigenvectors of P for each eigenvalue.

Starting with λ=0.

For λ=0, we solve (P - 0 I) x = 0.

So the matrix P itself:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 → 0 x1 + (1/√2) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 → equation 1: x2 = 0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) → (1/√2) x1 + 0 x2 + (1/√2) x3 = 0 → x1 + x3 = 0.

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 → 0 x1 + (1/√2) x2 + 0 x3 = 0 → x2 =0.

So from equation 1 and 3, x2=0.

From equation 2, x1 = -x3.

Let x3 = t, then x1 = -t, x2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form t*(-1, 0, 1)^T.

We can normalize this vector. The length squared is (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 2 → so the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

So the eigenstate for P=0 is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1)^T. Let's denote this as |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

We need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. That is, the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.

The eigenvector is |v> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

The amplitude is the inner product <v | ψ>.

Compute <v|ψ> = (-1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

The probability is |amplitude|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, that's not possible. The probability can't be 2 because probabilities are at most 1.

Wait, that indicates a mistake somewhere. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the initial state |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1)^T, and the eigenvector |v> is (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is:

( (-1) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 * 0) + (1 * (1/sqrt(2)) )

= (1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is sqrt(2), so the probability is (sqrt(2))² = 2. But that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.

Ah, so I must have made a mistake. Maybe I messed up the normalization of |v>.

Wait, let me recheck the normalization of |v>. The vector is [-1, 0, 1], right? So the length squared is (-1)^2 + 0^2 + (1)^2 = 2. So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2)) * [-1, 0, 1], which is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ].

So that part is correct. So when I compute the inner product, I should get:

(-1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (1/sqrt(2)) * 1

= (1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Wait, but sqrt(2) is about 1.414, which when squared is 2. So the probability is 2. That's impossible because probabilities can't be more than 1.

Wait, that must mean I made a mistake. Because the initial state is not normalized. Oh wait, the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1)^T. That's a vector, but is it normalized? Let me check.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the initial state is not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, meaning their norm is 1. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, which complicates things.

Wait, but perhaps the initial state is not required to be normalized. Because in the problem statement, the state is given as (-1,2,1), so perhaps the initial state is not normalized, but we can proceed.

Wait, but when calculating probabilities, the state should be normalized, perhaps. Hmm, perhaps I should normalize the state before proceeding.

So the initial vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, and its norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

But the problem didn't mention whether the state is normalized. Hmm, this complicates things. Because if the state is not normalized, the probabilities would be based on the unnormalized state.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state is always a unit vector. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, and we're supposed to normalize it before proceeding.

So to avoid confusion, let's proceed with the normalized state.

So the initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so we should normalize it:

|ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So now, when calculating the inner product with |v>, which is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T, the inner product is:

( (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) )

= (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) ) + 0 + (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) )

= (1 +1 ) / (sqrt(12)) )

= 2 / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= 1/sqrt(3).

So the amplitude is 1/sqrt(3), and the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3. That's the first part.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenstate |v>, which is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

Now, we measure Q on this state. What is the probability that Q gives -1?

The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, since it's diagonal.

The eigenvectors of Q are:

For Q=1: [1, 0, 0]^T.

For Q=0: [0, 1, 0]^T.

For Q=-1: [0, 0, 1]^T.

Wait, because Q is diagonal, its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.

So, the state after measuring P=0 is |v> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

We can express |v> as a linear combination of Q's eigenstates.

|v> = ( -1/sqrt(2) ) |e1> + 0 |e2> + (1/sqrt(2)) |e3>.

Where |e1> = [1,0,0], |e3> = [0,0,1].

So when we measure Q in this state, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q corresponding to the components.

The probability of each outcome is the square of the modulus of the coefficient in front of each eigenstate.

So the coefficient for Q=1 is -1/sqrt(2). The modulus squared is (1/2).

The coefficient for Q=0 is 0. So probability zero.

The coefficient for Q=-1 is 1/sqrt(2). Modulus squared is 1/2.

So when measuring Q after P=0, the probabilities are:

P(Q=1) = 1/2,

P(Q=0) = 0,

P(Q=-1) = 1/2.

But the question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

So the total probability is the probability of P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0, which is 1/2.

So the joint probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check this.

Another approach: the probability is the modulus squared of the amplitude for the combined event.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is not normalized, but I think we normalized it earlier, so the calculation should proceed correctly.

So the answer is 1/6, which is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequence of measurements and the associated probabilities.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Operator \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \(\det(P - \lambda I) = 0\). The determinant calculation yields:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( P \) are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is found by solving \( (P - 0I)x = 0 \). The normalized eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Normalize the Initial State
The initial state is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( |\psi_{\text{normalized}}\rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( |v\rangle \). The amplitude is:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left|\langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle\right|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to the eigenstate \( |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 5: Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \), and its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors:

\[
|e_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |e_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |e_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state \( |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix} \) can be expressed as:

\[
|v\rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)|e_1\rangle + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)|e_3\rangle.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the coefficient of \( |e_3\rangle \):

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Joint Probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

**Answer: D**
