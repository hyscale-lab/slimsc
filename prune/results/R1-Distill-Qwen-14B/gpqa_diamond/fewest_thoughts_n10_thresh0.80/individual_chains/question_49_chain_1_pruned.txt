Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements and some specific reactions. Let me read it carefully.

The question has three parts: reactions leading to products A, B, and C. I need to match each product with the given options A, B, C, or D.

First, I'll look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A

Hmm, okay. I remember that when amines and alcohols are involved with methoxy groups and heat, it might be a Claisen or Cope rearrangement. Wait, Claisen is for allyl vinyl ethers, right? Or maybe it's the Oppenauer oxidation? No, Oppenauer is for ketones to alcohols. Wait, the problem says these are sigma-tropic rearrangements, so Claisen and Cope are examples.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Structure-wise, that's a molecule where the amine (NH2) is attached to a carbon which has two methoxy groups (OCH3) and another carbon. So it's like HOCH2-C-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (OCH3)2CH-NH2? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but if it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then it's OCH3 groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure would be (OCH3)2CH-NH2. So that's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon.

But then, what happens when it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under acidic conditions and heat? But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons
