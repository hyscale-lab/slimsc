Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that both planets have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period means it's closer. Also, the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2. But both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius as Planet_1's host. Interesting.

Wait, I think the probability of transit is given by the formula P = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (1/(a^2)), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's more about the orbital distance and the star's size. Oh no, wait. The transit probability formula is actually based on the geometry of the system. The probability (p) that a planet transits is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly (R_star / a). Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is proportional to (
