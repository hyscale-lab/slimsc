Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, given some specific parameters.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, and both have circular orbits. 

The host stars are also different. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, how is that possible? I thought more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so it might have expanded but not as much as a main-sequence star. So same size but different masses.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula I recall is something like (R_planet / R_star) squared divided by (something else), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is planet radius, R_s is star radius. But wait, also, the probability depends on the orbital distance. Oh right, another factor is the ratio of the star’s radius to the orbital distance. Because the planet has to be in the right part of the sky for us to see it transit. The formula I think is (R_s / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet’s orbit.

Wait, so the transit probability P is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) / (something else? Or is it just that? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but wait, no, maybe it's (R_s / a) multiplied by another factor. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, which is (R_s / a), and then multiplied by the probability
