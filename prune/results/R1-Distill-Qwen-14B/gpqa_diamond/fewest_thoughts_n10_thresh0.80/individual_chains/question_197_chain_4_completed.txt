Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product. The options are four different compounds, so I need to deduce what X is and then what happens when it reacts in those conditions.

First, let me look at the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data are given, so I should analyze those to figure out the structure of X.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so X must have an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a broad singlet. A peak around 10 ppm is likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. But wait, broad usually means it's exchanging, like in an -OH group. But sometimes, a carbonyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom might cause a downfield shift, but I'm more thinking -OH here.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – these are typical for para-substituted aromatic protons. The doublets suggest there are two sets of equivalent protons on the aromatic ring, which is common in para-substituted benzene derivatives.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – a multiplet, maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen or a carbonyl. Or perhaps a CH group in a branched chain. The integration is 1H, so maybe a CH connected to something else.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – another multiplet, perhaps another CH2 group, maybe part of a chain.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a doublet for 3H. That sounds like a methyl group attached to something that's next to a CH, maybe a carbonyl or an oxygen. Wait, a doublet for a methyl suggests it's next to a CH with two protons. Or perhaps it's a geminal di-substitution? Wait, no, if it's a CH connected to a CH3, then the CH3 would be split into a doublet if the CH has neighboring H's. Hmm.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a triplet for 3H, which is usually a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together: the aromatic part is a para-substituted benzene. The substituents would be something that gives the other signals.

In the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak suggests an -OH group, but wait, if X has a carbonyl (from IR at 1720), maybe it's a ketone and an -OH elsewhere? Or perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: if the IR has a strong 1720 cm-1 peak, that's a good indicator. A carboxylic acid has a carbonyl around 1700-1725 cm-1, but also, the broad peak around 2500-3400 would make sense for the -OH. So maybe X is a benzoic acid derivative.

But wait, the NMR doesn't show a broad peak that's very downfield. The peak at 10.5 is a broad singlet, which aligns with a carboxylic acid's -OH. So perhaps X is a substituted benzoic acid.

But then, the other part of the molecule must have a substituent. Let's think about the NMR peaks beyond the aromatic region.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say, for example, CH2-CO-... Or maybe an allylic position. Alternatively, it could be part of an ethyl or propyl chain attached to the ring.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) suggests a CH2 that's adjacent to something. Maybe it's part of a propyl chain attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. If the benzene is para-substituted, with a group that includes a carbonyl and a chain.

Suppose the substituent is a group like -CO-R, where R is some alkyl chain. Let's say R is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a propanoic acid group attached to the benzene.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, so if it's a carboxylic acid, that's possible. So if it's a para-substituted benzoic acid with an alkyl group attached, then the substituent is a COOH group and another substituent on the ring.

Wait, no. Wait, the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1720, so that fits. So X could be a benzoic acid with a substituent on the benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Let me think about substituents that cause such shifts. A strong electron-withdrawing group like nitro would cause downfield shifts. But if it's a substituent like a methyl group, which is electron-donating, that would cause upfield shifts for the adjacent protons. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, if there's an electron-withdrawing group (like COOH) at one position, that would deshield the adjacent protons, shifting them downfield. So in para-substituted benzoic acid, the ortho protons are downfield.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If the substituents are at the para positions, then the substituents would be both at the 1 and 3 positions? No, para is 1 and 4 positions, right?

Wait, no. Wait, in benzene, substituents at para positions are across from each other, like 1 and 4. So, if the benzene has two substituents, like a COOH at position 1 and another group at position 4, then the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and para positions relative to the substituents.

Wait, but in this NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the structure must have two substituents on the benzene ring, each in the para position relative to each other. Wait, no. Wait, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, then each substituent has two ortho and two meta positions. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and another substituent is attached elsewhere. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that causes the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet. For example, if the substituent is a carbonyl group (like COOH) in the para position, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets. So, for example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. But without another substituent, that might not be the case. Alternatively, if there's a substituent at position 1 and another substituent at position 4, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the ring has only two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think of a substituent that would cause that. For example, if the substituent is a group that is itself symmetrical, like a methyl group, but in the para position. Wait, but a methyl group in the para position would cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think: benzene with a substituent at position 1 (like COOH) and another substituent at position 4 (like something else). Then, the aromatic protons would split into two sets of doublets.

But wait, maybe the substituent is a single group that is itself causing the splitting. For example, if the substituent is a group that's not symmetrical, but attached in such a way that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a disubstituted benzene where the substituents are in the para positions. For example, if the benzene has two substituents, each in para positions, but that would require four substituents perhaps? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's a substituent that's in the para position, and another substituent in the meta position. No, that would complicate the symmetry.

Wait, maybe the structure isn't a benzoic acid. Let me think again. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could also be an ester. The broad peak in the IR from 3400–2500 cm-1 could be from an alcohol, but maybe it's an O-H from an ester, but no, esters don't have O-H. Then, maybe it's an acid. The 1720 peak aligns with a ketone too. So it could be a ketone.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is more suggestive of an -OH group, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. So putting that together, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

So the structure might be something like 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, options C and A have benzoic acids or similar.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Hmm, that's a substituted propanoic acid.

Let me think about the NMR data again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene adjacent to the carbonyl. For a propanoic acid, the CH2 next to COOH would be around 2.3-2.5 ppm as a triplet. But here it's 2.9, which is higher. So maybe it's not a propanoic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent on the benzene is a chain with branching. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to something else. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a terminal methyl (CH2CH2CH3). So perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, let me think. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid. That would fit option C.

Let me think about the NMR signals for 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid.

The aromatic protons would be in two doublets because of the substituents. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm would correspond to the protons ortho and para to the substituents. Wait, but benzoic acid has a COOH group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. So the ortho and para protons would be deshielded, leading to downfield shifts. So if the COOH is in position 1, and the substituent is in position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and would be downfield. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and possibly upfield. Wait, but the substituent in position 4 is a sec-butyl group, which is electron-donating. That might cause the protons adjacent to it to be upfield.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact shifts. Let me think about the substituent's effect. The COOH group is in position 1, and the substituent is in position 4. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The protons in positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to the substituent. Protons 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to the substituent.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is an electron-donating group. So the protons adjacent to it (positions 3 and 5) would be more shielded (upfield shifted), while those further away (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded.

So in the NMR, the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) would be positions 2 and 6 (each as a doublet due to coupling with adjacent protons), and the upfield doublet (7.2 ppm) would be positions 3 and 5.

That fits with the data given: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So that works.

Now, looking at the substituent's NMR signals. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, no, wait. sec-Butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me correct that. The sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that can't be right. Wait, but wait, butyl groups can be primary, secondary, or tertiary.

Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a primary group. sec-Butyl would be (CH2)2CHCH2-? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 (straight chain)
- iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2- (the branching is on the second carbon)
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but wait, that's not possible because it would have only three bonds from the second carbon. Oh wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would require the butyl group to have four carbons. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, butyl is four carbons. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon group attached through the second carbon. So it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain as -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that’s three carbons. Hmm, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, no, that's more like a tertiary group. Wait, no, maybe I should draw it.

The correct structure for a sec-butyl group is:

The main chain is four carbons, attached via the second carbon. So, it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, but that's only three carbons. Oh wait, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHCH2- but I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the NMR signals for the substituent.

The substituent's NMR data:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): maybe a CH group adjacent to the benzene ring. If it's a sec-butyl group, the CH would be the central carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let's think about that. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene ring.

The NMR of an isobutyl group would have:

- The CH(CH3)2 group: the CH would be a septet (coupled with two CH3 groups), but wait, no. Wait, in an isobutyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)2), the CH2 next to the ring would be split into a quartet (coupled with the CH), and the CH would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR data given, I don't see a triplet for 2H. Instead, I see a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H). That's the terminal methyl group of an ethyl chain. So the substituent must have an ethyl chain attached to something else.

Wait, the substituent has a chain that includes a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a -CH2CH2CH3 group, so a propyl chain perhaps. But the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the middle CH2 of a propyl group.

Wait, let me think. Let's imagine the substituent is a propyl chain. So maybe something like CH2CH2CH3 attached to the ring. But that's a primary propyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 or CH group. The doublet implies that this methyl is adjacent to a CH with two other protons. So perhaps a structure like CH(CH3)CH2- something.

Wait, let's think about the substituent chain. The substituent could be a butyl group with a branch. For example, a sec-butyl group would have a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- structure attached to the ring. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the substituent would have a chain that includes:

- A CH2 group attached to the ring (maybe)
- A CH group connected to two CH2 groups and a methyl.

Wait, let me think about the protons.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH connected to two CH2 groups and a benzene.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group adjacent to the CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to the CH.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, so perhaps a CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the substituent would be:

CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-CH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the substituent as -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-, which is a isobutyl group. But that would give a CH(CH3) group, which would have neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH2, but that might not explain the 1.4 ppm doublet.

Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch, such as a sec-butyl group. In that case, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain attached through the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH2CH3). No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, but that would have three methyl groups attached to a central carbon.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR signals.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group with neighboring protons. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH connected to a CH2 and a CH3.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group next to another CH2 or CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, maybe part of an ethyl chain.

So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures in the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)- attached to position 4.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon substituent: the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2CH3. So the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, which is a four-carbon group (butyl) attached through the second carbon (so it's a sec-butyl group).

So the substituent's structure is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Now, let's think about the NMR signals for this substituent.

The CH2 group attached to the ring (position 4) would be a triplet, as it's adjacent to a CH group which has two protons. Wait, no, the CH2 next to the CH would be split into a quartet because it's next to a CH with two protons. But wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group.

The substituent would have the following structure: benzene ring - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - .

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, that would be a three-carbon chain, but butyl is four carbons. So perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but that's five carbons. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an iso-butyl group.

Wait, the iso-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

So, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show the CH2 group (attached to the ring) as a triplet (coupled with the CH group), and the CH would be a septet (coupled with two CH3 groups). But in the NMR data provided, I don't see a septet. So this might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let's think about the substituent being a propyl group attached through an oxygen, but that's not indicated by the IR data.

Wait, let's go back to the NMR data.

The substituent's signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group.

So, the substituent has a CH connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2CH3 group, and that CH is also connected to a CH3 group.

Wait, that would make the substituent:

R-O-C(R1)(R2) ?

No, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol group, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, maybe it's a butyl group where the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The terminal CH3 (0.9, t, 3H).
- The CH2 next to CH(CH3) would be a quartet (coupled with the CH), so around 1.7 ppm as a quartet.
- The CH group would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2 groups), around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.
- The methyl group attached to the CH would be a doublet (coupled with the CH), at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

That seems to fit the NMR data.

So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Specifically, it's a secondary butyl group, a sec-butyl group.

So, putting it all together, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's option C.

Now, the reaction: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when red phosphorus is used with HI, it's typically for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but more commonly, it's used in the hydrolysis of esters or for cleavage of certain functional groups. Wait, no, wait. Another reaction comes to mind: the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl and Hg. But red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but wait, no, another reaction.

Wait, no, wait. Another possibility: when an ester reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But in this case, X is a benzoic acid already, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the reduction of a carboxylic acid to an alcohol. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, another thought: I think that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it forms an acyl iodide. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydroiodic acid formation. For example, in the Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that typically involves formic acid and HCl.

Wait, wait, wait. Another reaction is the conversion of carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides using PCl5, but that's with phosphorus pentachloride. Red phosphorus might be used in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride using thionyl chloride, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, but that's for carbonates. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, no. Alternatively, when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it might form an acyl iodide. Wait, yes, I think that's the case. For example, RCOOH + P + HI → RCOI + PHO.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but with HI, it would form an acid iodide.

So, if X is a benzoic acid (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), reacting with red phosphorus and HI would form the corresponding acid iodide, RCOI. Then, the acid iodide might undergo further reactions, but wait, the question is about the final product. Or perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait a minute. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group. Wait, but red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the reduction of ketones to alkanes, but that's more the Clemmensen reduction. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is called the HWE (Hoffman-Walden) rearrangement, but that's for amines.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyl iodide. Wait, but X is a benzoic acid, so maybe the -COOH group is converted into an iodide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the -OH in the carboxylic acid with an iodide, forming a carboxylic acid iodide. But I'm not entirely sure about the conditions.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The carboxylic acid reacts with HI to form an acyl iodide, which would have the structure RCOI.

Wait, but the options don't include an acyl iodide. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C) and it reacts to form an acyl iodide, then the product wouldn't be any of these options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: Maybe the reaction isn't about the benzoic acid part, but about the substituent.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also cleave certain functional groups. For example, in the presence of a carbonyl group, perhaps it leads to the formation of an alcohol. Wait, but X has a carbonyl (from the benzoic acid). Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, if the carbonyl group is reduced, the benzoic acid would become benzyl alcohol. But that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, another possibility: if the carbonyl group is a ketone rather than a carboxylic acid. Let me reevaluate that.

If the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a ketone, then X would have a ketone group. Then, the 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR would be something else. But 10.5 ppm is very high, which is more indicative of an -OH group. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the 1720 cm-1 is an ester. Then, the 10.5 ppm peak would be an -OH from an alcohol. But if X is an ester, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could be a hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.

But then, looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, which would fit that. But that would mean X is an ester, and then after hydrolysis, it becomes the acid. But the question is about the product after the reaction, so perhaps that's the case.

Wait, let me think again. If X is an ester, like R-O-CO-R', then after hydrolysis with H2O/HI and red phosphorus, it would form R-OH and R'COOH. But in the options, option C is a benzoic acid, so perhaps the ester was RCOOR', and upon hydrolysis, it becomes RCOOH. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by an iodide. But then, the product would have an iodide, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is cleavage of the ester group. For example, if X is an ester, then treatment with HI could lead to cleavage. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, which upon heating, would lose CO2 and form an alkyl iodide. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group of the benzoic acid to a methylene group, turning the acid into a benzyl alcohol derivative. But that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a good leaving group, HI could displace it. But the substituent in X is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a good leaving group. Unless the substituent is something else.

Wait, let me think again about the structure of X. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's try to reevaluate the NMR data.

The 1H NMR data for X:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid.

8.0 (d, 2H), 7.2 (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.

Then, the other signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
1.7 (m, 2H)
1.4 (d, 3H)
0.9 (t, 3H)

These suggest a chain with a branching or a substituent. Perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group. Wait, but the 0.9 triplet would correspond to a -CH2CH2CH3 group.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a propyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Then, the NMR would have:

The CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

The CH(CH2CH3) would have a methyl group at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), but wait, that's not possible because the CH2CH3 would give a triplet.

Hmm, perhaps it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. For example, a secondary butyl group.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's chain could be -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2.

So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the NMR would have:

The CH2 group attached to the ring would be a triplet (coupled with the CH), around 2.3 ppm, but the given data shows 2.9 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, let me think about option C again: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If that's the case, then the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

The substituent's structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent has:

- CH2 (attached to ring)
- CH (with two CH2CH3 groups attached?)

Wait, no, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the CH group is connected to CH2CH3 and CH2-.

Thus, the substituent's NMR would have:

- The CH2 group (attached to the ring) as a quartet (coupled with the CH group), probably around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH group as a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2), around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The CH(CH2CH3) group: the CH2CH3 would be split into a triplet, but in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps the CH2CH3 is split into a doublet due to coupling with the CH group.

Wait, but the CH2CH3 is at the end of the chain, so it would be a triplet if coupled with a CH2 group. But the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which fits a terminal methyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to the ring.

So, the structure would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, that would be an isobutyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-, which would be a 2-methylpropyl group.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

But given the data, the substituent in X is likely a sec-butyl group, making option C the correct structure for X. Then, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, if X is a benzoic acid, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would form the corresponding acid iodide: RCOI. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the acid group and replacing it with something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzoic acid, and it reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's undergoing a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide. But that doesn't fit any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, but that would require a carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester, but X is a carboxylic acid, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in identifying X. Maybe X isn't a benzoic acid but a ketone.

If the IR's 1720 cm-1 is a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak must be something else. But 10.5 ppm is very high, which is more typical for an -OH group. So perhaps the 1720 is an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another angle: The IR data has a strong peak at 1720, which could be a ketone. The broad peak between 3400–2500 could be from an alcohol. So X could be a benzaldehyde derivative with an alcohol group. But I don't see any aldehyde protons in the NMR (the aromatic protons are at 8 and 7.2, and the other peaks don't include a strong peak around 9-10 ppm for an aldehyde).

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an -OH from an alcohol, but then the 1720 would be a ketone.

So, X would have a ketone group and an alcohol group attached to a para-substituted benzene.

Wait, but the NMR shows 10.5 ppm as a singlet, which could be an -OH group, but the NMR integration is 1H, so perhaps a phenol group. But the IR would show a broad peak in that region. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton, but that's usually a singlet around 9-10 ppm.

Wait, but the integration is 1H, so perhaps it's a single proton. Aldehyde would be a singlet, but in this case, the peak is broad. So maybe it's an -OH from a phenol.

But then, the IR would show O-H stretching around 3200-3600 cm-1. The IR data includes 3400-2500, which could cover that.

But if X is a phenol with a ketone group, then the structure would be something like 4-phenylphenol with a ketone substituent. But that doesn't explain the other NMR peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group. Hmm, not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to proceed with the earlier assumption that X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and see what the reaction would do.

If X is a benzoic acid, then treating with red phosphorus and HI would likely lead to the formation of the acid iodide, RCOI. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, but that would form R-I, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the -COOH group. If X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction converts it into benzene. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol. But that would require a reducing agent, and I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI are used for that.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, which then undergoes further reactions. But again, the options don't show an acyl iodide.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again to see which one would result from the reaction.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, but X is reacting, so the product can't be X itself. So option C is X, so the product must be one of the others.

Wait, that changes things. So, if X is option C, the product must be one of A, B, or D.

So, the reaction is X (option C) treated with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or amines, but in this case, X is a benzoic acid.

Wait, another reaction: perhaps the benzoic acid is undergoing some kind of substitution or elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the -COOH group into a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, but that's not relevant to the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the removal of the acid group, releasing CO2 and forming a benzene ring with the substituent being a sec-butyl group. But then, the product would be 4-sec-butylbenzene, which is option B or D.

Looking at option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Structure would be isobutyl at position 1 and methyl at 4. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, substituents at 1 and 4 positions: a sec-butyl and a methyl.

But earlier, X has a para-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl group and a COOH group at position 4.

Wait, no. X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have substituents at position 4 (COOH) and position 1 (sec-butyl)? No, because benzoic acid is at position 1 (the COOH is at position 1), and the substituent is at position 4.

Wait, no. 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4. So the structure is:

Positions 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4 (sec-butyl), 5, 6.

So, the benzene has substituents at positions 1 and 4.

Now, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH group is transformed into something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the carboxylic acid with an iodide, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is being converted into an iodide via the formation of an acyl iodide.

But then, after that, perhaps elimination happens.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent where the COOH has been replaced by an iodide. But that would require substitution, which is unlikely for a benzoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, turning the COOH into a CH2-I. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the benzene ring, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an aryl iodide via Ullmann coupling, but that typically requires a catalyst like copper and isn't done with red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction conditions again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but more commonly, they're used to form hydroiodic acid, which can be used for various substitutions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the carboxylic acid group to form an alkene. But without a β-hydrogen, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but with HI, it would form an acyl iodide, which could then undergo elimination.

Wait, but how does that help? Let me think.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it forms 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl iodide. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol.

Wait, reduction of carboxylic acid would typically require more vigorous conditions, like LiAlH4. But red phosphorus and HI might not do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by an iodide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a disubstituted benzene with substituents at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl).

But X has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So if the COOH is replaced by a methyl group, perhaps that's the product.

But under what reaction conditions would a carboxylic acid be converted into a methyl group? That would require a reduction, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is removed completely, leaving just the sec-butyl group. But then the product would be just the benzene ring with the sec-butyl group, which isn't one of the options except option B or D.

Wait, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which has substituents at positions 1 (isobutyl) and 4 (methyl). That doesn't align with X's structure.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). But X has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the COOH group with a methyl group. But I don't know of a reaction that does that with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into a methylene group, leading to benzene with a CH2 group, but that doesn't fit the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the COOH group but about the substituent. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the reaction conditions break that down.

But I don't see how that would happen. Red phosphorus and HI are more likely to react with functional groups like carbonyls or nitriles, not alkanes.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, but that would have a different IR signature.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the substituent. But I don't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that requires a different setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in identifying X.

Let me reevaluate X's structure.

IR: 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (likely ketone or ester or acid).

The broad peak between 3400-2500 cm-1 suggests O-H or N-H. If it's O-H, then X could be a carboxylic acid, phenol, or alcohol.

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely a carboxylic acid -OH.
- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.
- 2.9 (m, 1H): perhaps a CH adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 (m, 2H): a CH2 group.
- 1.4 (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 (t, 3H): a terminal CH3.

So, the substituent is a chain with a branching.

If the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 (isobutyl group), then the NMR would have:

- CH2CH(CH3)2: the CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with CH), around 1.7 ppm (2H).
- The CH would be a triplet (coupled with two CH3 groups), around 2.9 ppm (1H).
- The CH3 groups would be septets, but I don't see that in the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-.

So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But that would be a pentyl group, which is longer than necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but that would be a 3-pentyl group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, but that would be -(C(CH3)3).

In that case, the substituent would be a single peak for the CH groups, but the NMR doesn't show that.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps I should conclude that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, but I'm not sure what the product would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, which then undergoes elimination to form an alkene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the acid to a primary alcohol, turning the COOH into CH2OH. But again, the options don't show that.

Wait, another thought: when a benzoic acid reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it could form an aryl iodide. For example, the -COOH group could be replaced by an iodide via some substitution mechanism. But I'm not certain about this.

If that's the case, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with an iodide at position 1. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is removed, and the product is just benzene with a methyl group, but that's not the case.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again.

If X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction replaces the -COOH with a methyl group, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D (but option D has 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would imply substituents at 1 and 4, which isn't the case here).

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a methyl group where the COOH was. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would have substituents at 1 (methyl) and 4 (sec-butyl). That would be option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But how would that happen? How would a benzoic acid turn into a methyl group upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI?

I'm not sure, but perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, which would require a strong reducing agent. But I don't know if red phosphorus and HI can do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide, which is then subjected to some elimination or displacement, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the initial analysis, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely forms an acyl iodide, but since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction doesn't change X, which can't be right because the question asks for the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent. For example, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the reaction replaces the CH2 group with something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a bromide or chloride, and the reaction replaces it with iodide. But the substituent in X is a sec-butyl group, which is an alkyl group, not a halide.

Hmm. In the absence of a clear reaction pathway, I'll have to make an educated guess.

If X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction leads to the formation of 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group where the acid was, that would be option D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the acid to an alcohol, making X into 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, but that's not applicable.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C, but that can't be because X is the starting material. So, the product must be something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the -COOH group with a methyl group. So, X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) becomes 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

But I'm not sure how that reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, but that would require a different reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the acid group but the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, but that's not supported by the data.

I think I've exhausted all options, and the most plausible product is option C, but since X is the starting material, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. Perhaps this is a Fittig reaction, where aryl halides are coupled. But X doesn't have a halide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an aryl iodide. So, X's -COOH group is replaced by iodide, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)benzene-1-iodide. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the acid group, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with the substituent being the sec-butyl group, but that would leave the product as 4-sec-butylbenzene, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the acid to a methyl group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D.

But I'm not certain about this.

Given all this confusion, I think I'll have to go with option C as X and option C as the product, but that can't be right because X is the starting material.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the reaction doesn't change the substituent but the acid group.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacting with red phosphorus and HI might form the acid iodide, but that's not an option. So the product isn't among the options, which can't be the case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but X is already a carboxylic acid. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid, which would be option C. But then X would be the ester, and the product would be option C, which is the acid.

But the question says X has the given spectroscopic data. So, perhaps X is the ester, and the product is the acid.

But looking at the IR data, the 1720 cm-1 peak could be an ester carbonyl. Then, the broad peak would be from an alcohol or phenol.

But then, the NMR would have an ester group, which typically shows up as a singlet around δ 4 ppm for the ester oxygen adjacent to a CH3. But in the given NMR, there's no such peak. So perhaps that's not the case.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But since that's X, the product must be something else. So perhaps I've made a mistake in identifying X.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the acid group, leaving the substituent. So, X is option C, and the product is 4-sec-butylbenzene, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct product is option B or D.

But I'm really stuck. I'll have to make a guess. I think the correct answer is option C, but the product must be something else.

Wait, another angle: The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) can also be used to cleave esters into carboxylic acids and alcohols. So, if X is an ester, the product would be the corresponding acid (option C). But then, X would be the ester, and the product would be option C. But the question says X has the given data, which would include the ester signals, which I don't see.

Hmm.

Well, after all this, I think the correct answer is option C, but I'm not certain about the reaction outcome. However, since the options don't include an acyl iodide, I think the reaction must be something else. Perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide, but that's not an option either.

Given all this, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option D.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H or N-H group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong absorption consistent with a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid, ketone, or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain.

### Structure of Compound X:
Based on the spectroscopic data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The para-substituted benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)) explains the NMR signals for the CH, CH₂, and CH₃ groups.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for reactions involving carboxylic acids, such as forming acyl iodides or undergoing substitution reactions. However, none of the options provided match the expected products of such reactions (e.g., acyl iodides). Instead, the reaction appears to result in a product where the carboxylic acid group is replaced by a methyl group, forming **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This structure does not match the spectroscopic data or the reaction conditions.
2. **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure implies a disubstituted benzene with an isobutyl group at position 1 and a methyl group at position 4, which does not align with the structure of X or the reaction.
3. **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: This is the structure of Compound X, not the product of the reaction.
4. **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure matches the expected product when the carboxylic acid group in X is replaced by a methyl group.

### Conclusion:
The reaction converts the carboxylic acid group in X into a methyl group, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** as the final product.

Answer: D
