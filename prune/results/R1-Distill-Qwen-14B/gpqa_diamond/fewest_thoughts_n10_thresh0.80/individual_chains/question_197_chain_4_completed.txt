Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy yet. But I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

The compound X has some IR and NMR data, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. Okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the spectroscopic data. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H (like in carboxylic acids or alcohols) or maybe N-H, but since there's no nitrogen in the options, probably O-H. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or acid. The other peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching.

Now the NMR. The 1H NMR has several signals. Let me list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton. But wait, carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, but they are usually broad. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Probably aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift suggests they're next to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, maybe the other two aromatic protons. So this would fit a para-substituted benzene where two protons are deshielded (downfield) and two are more shielded. Wait, but if the substituent is electron-withdrawing, the ortho and para protons would be deshielded. Hmm. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, the ortho protons would be more deshielded than the para. Wait, maybe this is a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Like a para-substituted group which is an EWG.

Wait, but looking at the shift. 8.0 ppm is higher than 7.2. So maybe the 8.0 is the more deshielded (ortho to EWG), and the 7.2 is the para? Or perhaps it's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached or something else. Hmm.

Other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a methylene or a CH group adjacent to something, like an oxygen or a carbonyl. Maybe a CH next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons as a multiplet. Maybe a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom or a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet. That's typical for a methyl group adjacent to a CH group, like in an isopropyl group (CH(CH3)2). So maybe this is a CH(CH3)2 group, where the CH is split into a triplet but here it's a doublet? Wait, no. Wait, wait. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet with 3H, so that's a CH3 group attached to something. If it's a doublet, perhaps it's attached to a CH group that's split into a triplet. Wait, maybe it's an isopropyl group. For example, a group like CH(CH3)2, where one CH3 is attached to a CH that's connected to something else.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, the structure might have a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720 cm-1). The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm which could be a carboxylic acid proton. So perhaps the structure is a phenyl ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an acid.

Wait, but if the IR has a peak at 1720, which is higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700 but can vary). Wait, wait, carboxylic acids have broad IR around 2500-3300 (for O-H) and a strong peak around 1700. But if the peak is at 1720, that might be a ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde. But the IR has a peak around 1610 and 1450, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching.

Wait, so the IR has O-H (3400–2500), which is a broad region, and a strong C=O at 1720. So if it's a carbonyl, and the O-H is there, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 1700, but maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but if the compound has a carboxylic acid group, the NMR would show a broad singlet around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm peak. So that suggests a carboxylic acid.

So, thinking about the structure, perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative. Let's imagine a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carboxylic acid. The substituent would be at a certain position on the ring.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, the two doublets each have 2H, which would fit a disubstituted benzene in the para positions. So perhaps a benzene ring with two substituents, one being a carboxylic acid and the other something else. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another group. Let's think about that.

Wait, let's think about the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3 group. Wait, that's an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl group attached to a chain. For example, maybe it's an aryl ketone with a chain attached.

Wait, if the substituent is a ketone, like Ar-CO-R. The IR would have a strong C=O around 1720. The 10.5 ppm peak would be something else, but wait, if it's a ketone, then the O-H is from where? Hmm, that's confusing. Because if it's a ketone, where's the O-H? Maybe the 10.5 peak isn't an O-H then. Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from somewhere else.

Wait, but if the IR shows a peak at 3400–2500, which is a broad region, it's probably an O-H stretch. So that would suggest the presence of a hydroxyl group. So if the compound has both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group, perhaps it's a benzoic acid. But then the substituent on the benzene would be a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm signals are for the aromatic protons. If the substituent is a carboxylic acid group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, the adjacent protons (ortho and para) would be deshielded. So, in a para-substituted benzoic acid, the ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 3, but in a monosubstituted benzoic acid, the ring would have only the COOH group. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring in para positions. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that's attached to the ring, and that group has a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a benzoyl group attached to another group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent like -COO-R or -CO-R, but that doesn't seem to fit the O-H peak.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester or a ketone with another group. Hmm, but not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe the compound isn't a benzoic acid but a phenol with a carbonyl group. But phenols have O-H peaks around 5 ppm in NMR, but the 10.5 ppm is more like a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a phenyl ketone with an adjacent hydroxyl group. But that might not fit the data.

Wait, let me think again. The NMR shows 1H as a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is likely a carboxylic acid. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group. The NMR's aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern. So, for benzoic acid, the ring has the COOH group in position 1. The adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6) would be ortho, and the para would be position 4. Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, two substituents at positions 1 and 3, but that's meta. Alternatively, substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para). Hmm, but if it's a monosubstituted benzene, the splitting might be different.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and the ring has another substituent in the meta or ortho. Wait, no, that might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group that's itself a substituent with a benzene ring. Wait, perhaps the compound is a diaryl ketone? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a methyl benzoate or ethyl benzoate, but that doesn't fit the O-H peak.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a phenyl propionate or similar, but again, not matching the O-H.

Wait, maybe it's an aromatic ketone with a side chain that includes a hydroxyl group. For example, something like 4-phenylpropan-2-ol, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the other NMR signals again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or a ketone. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group attached to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a carbonyl group connected to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2CH2CH3? Wait, not sure. Let me try to sketch it.

Another possibility is that the substituent on the benzene is a ketone group (CO-) attached to a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH2-O-CO- group. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoic acid group with a chain.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's think about that structure. The benzene ring would have a substituent in position 4, which is a sec-butyl group, and a carboxylic acid group in position, say, 1?

Wait, no. Wait, for benzoic acid, the COOH is attached directly to the benzene. So the substituents would be the COOH group and another group in the para position, which would be position 4.

Wait, no. The benzene has six positions. If the COOH is at position 1, the para position would be position 4. So a substituent at position 4 would be opposite the COOH.

So the structure would be 4-(substituent)-benzoic acid.

So in option C, it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has the COOH group in position 1 and a sec-butyl group in position 4.

But wait, the NMR shows a couple of signals that might correspond to the substituent. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH of the sec-butyl group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the adjacent CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the methyl group attached to the CH, and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the ethyl group.

Wait, what's a sec-butyl group? It's a four-carbon group attached via the second carbon. So, CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait.

Wait, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, no. Let me clarify: butyl groups. The four carbons. The straight chain is CH2CH2CH2CH3. The substituent can be in different positions. A sec-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's think of butyl as having four carbons. The "sec" refers to the position of attachment. For sec-butyl, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)– attached to the benzene. So the substituent is a CH2 group, then a CH group attached to two CH2CH3 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as:

The benzene ring is attached to a group like -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait.

Alternatively, the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–. So the substituent is (CH2CH(CH2CH3)– attached to the ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)– group, making it a sec-butyl group.

So in the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Now, let's analyze the NMR for that structure.

The aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern. The COOH group is an electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded, appearing downfield. The para proton (position 4) would be in a different environment. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent affects the adjacent protons. But if there are two substituents, their combined effects would influence the NMR.

Wait, in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, there are two substituents on the benzene: COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4, which are para to each other.

The aromatic protons would be in positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. The ring is now 1,4-disubstituted. The substituents are COOH and sec-butyl. The COOH is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) protons. Wait, position 4 is where the sec-butyl is attached, so the para position from COOH would be position 4, which is already substituted. So the ortho positions to COOH are 2 and 6, which would have lower electron density, so their protons would appear downfield.

The substituent at position 4, the sec-butyl, is an electron-donating group (since it's an alkyl group), which would shield the adjacent protons. So the protons at positions 3 and 5 would be ortho to the sec-butyl group, which is electron-donating, so their protons would be more shielded, appearing upfield.

So in the NMR, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (downfield, around 8.0 ppm) and positions 3 and 5 (upfield, around 7.2 ppm).

That matches the NMR data: two doublets, each integrating to 2H, at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So that fits.

Now, the other signals in the NMR:

The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is the COOH proton, which is broad because of hydrogen bonding.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That would be the CH group in the sec-butyl substituent. The CH group is connected to two CH2 groups. Because it's a CH connected to two CH2's, the protons on that CH would be a multiplet. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the two CH2 groups next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of the substituent. Wait, actually, the sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–. So the CH is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, which means the CH is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps:

The substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)– attached to the benzene. So the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is a four-carbon chain, attached via the second carbon. So the structure is benzene-CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, that's not correct because the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, maybe it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but no, that's isobutyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–. So, the substituent is a four-carbon group attached via the second carbon. So, for benzene, the substituent is attached to the benzene as CH2CH(CH2CH3).

So, in the NMR, the CH group (the one attached to two CH2 groups) would have protons that are split into a multiplet. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is likely the CH group. The adjacent CH2 groups would be split into their own multiplets. The CH2 next to the benzene (the first CH2) would be at around 1.7 ppm (m,2H). The CH2 attached to the CH would be another CH2, but wait, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3), so the CH is attached to two CH2 groups: one from the benzene and one from the CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3), so the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

In that case, the CH2 group attached to the benzene (the first CH2) would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH group. The CH group has three protons, but wait, no, the CH is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that's not right. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the NMR signals.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 group attached to a CH. That CH3 is a doublet, implying it's attached to a CH which is split by neighboring protons. So perhaps the CH group is in an isopropyl arrangement. For example, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group attached to the ring. No, that's a tert-butyl.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3), which would have the following groups:

- CH2 attached to benzene.

- CH attached to CH2 and CH2CH3.

So the CH group (the one in the middle) would have neighboring protons from the CH2 and the CH2CH3. So in the NMR, its protons would be split into a multiplet, possibly a triplet or more complex.

The CH2 attached to the benzene would be next to the CH group and would have two protons. The CH2CH3 group is a terminal ethyl group, giving a triplet at around 0.9 ppm.

So in the NMR:

- The CH group (the one in the middle) would have a triplet or multiplet. But in the data, it's at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). Hmm, but wait, that's 1H, which suggests only one proton. That can't be right because the CH group has three protons. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So the substituent is a (CH3)2CH-CH2 group attached to the ring. Wait, that's a isoamyl group, not a sec-butyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH in position 1 and a sec-butyl in position 4.

The substituent (sec-butyl) would have the structure:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

So the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

Now, let's look at the NMR:

The substituent's CH2 (attached to the benzene) would have two protons. The CH (attached to two CH2 groups) would have three protons. Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could be the CH2 attached to the benzene. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH group, but that doesn't make sense because the CH has three protons. Unless the CH is split into a multiplet but integrated as 1H. That doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure. Maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a different substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a simple alkyl group but something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus is typically used in the Hinsberg reaction, which is used to determine if a compound is an amine or a sulfonic acid. Wait, but in this case, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be a substitution.

Wait, another thought: when a compound with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it typically undergoes a reaction where the carbonyl is converted into a hydroxyl group. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction? No, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hinsberg test, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the Hinsberg reaction uses benzene sulfonyl chloride to determine if a compound is an amine. But perhaps in this case, the reaction is a substitution of a leaving group.

Wait, but the starting material has a carbonyl group. Another possibility is that the starting material is a nitrile, which when treated with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze to an amine. But the IR doesn't show a peak around 2200 cm-1, which is typical for nitriles. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alkyl halide. Wait, but the IR doesn't show a peak for C-Cl (around 550-850 cm-1) or C-Br (around 600-650 cm-1), so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the compound has a carbonyl group, and the reaction is a reduction. Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are more likely to be involved in substitution reactions, perhaps with good leaving groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of an ether or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride from a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But without knowing the exact reaction conditions, it's hard to say.

Wait, but let's think about the product options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is the same as the starting material, so that's probably not it. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid; that's a different structure. Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is another toluene derivative.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is converting a ketone to an alcohol. Wait, but the starting material has a carboxylic acid, so maybe the reaction affects a different part.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzoyl chloride or some other compound with a good leaving group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. Wait, if the starting material is a nitrile, the reaction would form an amine. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another angle: the IR and NMR indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid. If the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a substitution where the acid is converted into something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI are the typical reagents for that; usually, it's thionyl chloride or other chlorinating agents.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by something else. But without a leaving group in the starting material, I'm not sure.

Wait, what if the starting material is a benzyl chloride or some other benzene derivative with a leaving group attached. But the IR doesn't show a peak for C-Cl, which would be around 550-850 cm-1.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR and IR. The IR shows a strong C=O at 1720, which I thought was a ketone or ester, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that peak would be around 1700. So perhaps the 1720 is more indicative of a ketone, and the 10.5 ppm peak is not a carboxylic acid but something else.

Wait, that would change things. If the C=O is a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak could be an alcohol proton. But then the IR's 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad region, which could correspond to an O-H stretch from an alcohol or maybe an amine. But the options don't include amines, so probably an alcohol.

So the structure would have a ketone group and an alcohol group. But how does that fit with the NMR?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group attached to the ring, and there's a ketone elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzyl alcohol with a ketone substituent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone and an ethyl group. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a methyl benzoate ester. But then the IR would have a peak around 1740 cm-1, which is typical for esters. The 1720 is a bit lower, but possible.

If it's an ester, the NMR would have a triplet for the ethyl group, which is present at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be the CH3 attached to the O in the ester. Wait, but esters typically have a triplet for the CH3 adjacent to the oxygen. Hmm, but in the NMR data, the 1.4 is a doublet, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. But the IR would have a peak around 2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde's C-H stretch, which isn't present here.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is a ketone. Let's consider that. The IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1 for a ketone. The 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR could be an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it's an acidic proton, but not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is an O-H from an alcohol. So the structure would have a ketone and an alcohol group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a ketone and an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-O-R group, which is an ester. Then the NMR would have a triplet for the R group, which is present here. But the IR peak at 1720 would fit an ester.

Wait, an ester's carbonyl is usually around 1740-1720 cm-1, which fits. The O-H in the ester is not present, so the IR peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 must be from another group. But if it's an ester, the O-H would be from where? Maybe it's an alcohol elsewhere.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the reaction. The starting material reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but I don't see a nitrile in the starting material.

Alternatively, another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI is the conversion of a carbonyl group into an alcohol. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, a ketone could be reduced to an alcohol. But I'm not certain about the exact conditions.

Wait, another reaction: when a ketone is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo a substitution. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. But without a leaving group in the starting material, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, which would be replaced by iodide. But without seeing the starting structure, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a carbonyl group. For example, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative, the aldehyde group could be replaced by iodide under certain conditions. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl, but that's not the same as red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, maybe it's a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, which uses Al alcoholates to reduce ketones, but again, the reagents don't match.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of a ketone. But I don't think that's standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen of the ketone acts as a leaving group, but that's unlikely without a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of an enol ether from a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus more on the reaction and less on the structure. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, another angle: the starting material has a carbonyl group, and the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by iodide. So, for example, if the starting material is a ketone, the reaction could produce an iodide. Alternatively, if the starting material is an ester, the oxygen could be replaced.

But getting back to the options, let's see:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a COOH group. If the reaction replaces the COOH group with a COOH iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into something else, like an acid chloride, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting a ketone into an alcohol, but without knowing the starting structure, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. For example, if the starting material has a substituent with a good leaving group, then HI could substitute it with an iodide. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. Wait, but with HI, that's more of a hydrohalogenation.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group. For example, if the starting material is a ketone, HI could add across the carbonyl, forming a gem-dihalide. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a haloform reaction, which converts a methyl ketone into a carboxylic acid and a methyl iodide. But the starting material doesn't seem to be a methyl ketone based on the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Crossed Cannizzaro reaction, but that's for aldehydes and requires a strong base, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl group is replaced by iodide. For example, if the starting material is a benzoyl chloride, but that's not indicated in the data.

Hmm, maybe I should look for the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about what each option would form.

If the starting material is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacting with HI and red phosphorus: perhaps it's forming an acid chloride, but without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the acid into an iodide. But how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by iodide. But that would require the COOH to be a good leaving group, which it isn't under normal conditions. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is introducing an iodide into the side chain.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material has a carbonyl group and an adjacent hydrogen, the reaction with HI could add across the carbonyl, forming an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition, but that's more about conjugated systems.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option and see what reaction would lead to it.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material is, say, 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the aldehyde group to a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is introducing a substituent.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try another approach. Let's think about what the reaction with red phosphorus and HI does. I recall that it's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but without a nitrile in the starting material, that's probably not it.

Another use of HI with red phosphorus is in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes. Wait, but if the starting material is an alcohol, the reaction would oxidize it to a carbonyl group.

Wait, that could be the case. For example, if the starting material is a secondary alcohol, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would oxidize it to a ketone.

But according to the NMR data, the starting material has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reaction isn't affecting that part but another part.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a secondary alcohol with a carbonyl group elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is cleaving a C-O bond. For example, if the starting material is an ether, the reaction could break it into two fragments. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution on an aromatic ring. For instance, if the starting material has a halogen substituent, the reaction could replace it with an iodide. But the NMR doesn't show any signals indicative of halogens, so perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the options again. The question is to find the product after the reaction. Let's consider each option:

Option C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. If the starting material is a benzoic acid with a different substituent, perhaps the reaction changes the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding iodide to the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a CH2 group, the reaction could convert it into CH2I. But none of the options seem to reflect that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is introducing an iodide group into the structure. For example, if the starting material has a hydrogen at a certain position, the reaction could substitute it with iodide. But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group in the starting material is replaced by iodide. For example, if the starting material is a benzyl chloride, the reaction would substitute it with iodide, forming benzyl iodide.

Hmm, but the starting material's NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of a chlorinated compound, so that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But if the starting material is an ester, then the product would be the corresponding acid. But option C is a benzoic acid, so perhaps that's the case. But then the starting material would have to be the ester.

Wait, let's think. If the starting material is the ester, say, methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then hydrolysis with HI and red phosphorus would convert it into the carboxylic acid, which is option C. But that would mean the starting material is the ester, which I'm not sure about.

But looking at the NMR data, the starting material has a peak at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which could be a CH3 from an ester group (like OCH3). But the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which is more typical for a CH3 attached to a CH, not an oxygen. So maybe it's not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reaction converts it into an alcohol. But then the product would be a secondary alcohol, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative with a substituent that includes a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent but does something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction reagent (red phosphorus and HI) is known to be used in the Hinsberg reaction to test for amine types. But since the options don't include amines, perhaps it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a carbonyl oxygen with iodide. For example, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde, the reaction would produce benzaldehyde iodide. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is introducing an iodide into a side chain. For example, if the starting material has a CH2 group, the reaction could substitute a hydrogen with iodide, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding iodide to the side chain. For example, if the starting material has a CH2CH2 group, the reaction could substitute a hydrogen with iodide, but that's not reflected in the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the most plausible option based on the NMR and reaction.

The NMR suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid (10.5 ppm), a para-substituted benzene, and a substituent with a CH group, CH2 groups, and ethyl group.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be introducing iodide into the structure, but given the options, perhaps the product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but the product is the same as the starting material. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent changes. For example, if the substituent is a bromide, it could be replaced by iodide. But none of the options reflect that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group, and the reaction replaces it with a larger group, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is converting a ketone into an alcohol. If the starting material is a ketone, the reaction would produce a secondary alcohol. But the options don't show any alcohols.

Wait, but option B and D are toluene derivatives. So perhaps the starting material is a toluene derivative with a substituent, and the reaction adds an iodide.

Wait, the options B and D have substituents like isobutyl and methyl groups attached to benzene. So perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen on the benzene ring is replaced with an isobutyl group.

But that doesn't fit with the starting material's NMR, which has a substituent that's more complex than a simple methyl.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is adding an ethyl group somewhere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could be a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, where an alkyl halide is used to add an alkyl group to the benzene ring. But the starting material would need to be an aromatic compound with activating groups, and the reaction would introduce a new substituent.

Given that the starting material's IR and NMR suggest a substituted benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction is adding an iodide to the benzene ring.

But I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the data.

The NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that includes a chain with ethyl and isopropyl groups. The IR suggests a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone or ester. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be introducing iodide into the substituent.

Looking at the options, option C is the same as the starting material, so that's probably not the product. Option A is a propanoic acid derivative, which might not fit the NMR.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with an isobutyl and methyl group. But the starting material's NMR doesn't suggest a simple methyl substituent.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Again, similar to B but with a different substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding an iodide to the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a CH2 group, the reaction could substitute a hydrogen with iodide, forming a CH2I group. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group in the substituent is replaced by iodide. For example, if the substituent is a CH2Br, it would become CH2I. But without seeing the starting structure, it's hard.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but I'm not sure why the reaction would leave it unchanged. Maybe the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but does something else. But I can't think of what.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted into iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be adding iodide to the side chain. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2 group, the reaction could substitute a hydrogen with iodide, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. If the starting material is a ketone, the reaction could reduce it to an alcohol. But the options don't have any alcohols.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the NMR and IR data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't change it, so the product is the same as the starting material. But that doesn't make sense as an exam question.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the reaction. Maybe the reaction is converting a nitrile group into an amine, but without a nitrile in the starting material, that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the carbonyl oxygen. For example, if the starting material is a benzaldehyde, the reaction would substitute the aldehyde oxygen with iodide, forming benzaldehyde iodide. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting a ketone into an alcohol. So if the starting material is a ketone, the product would be an alcohol. But the options don't have any alcohols.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But if the starting material is an ester, the product would be the acid, which is option C. So that's a possibility.

So, if the starting material is the ester, the reaction would hydrolyze it to the acid, which is option C. Therefore, the product is option C.

But wait, the IR of the starting material has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more consistent with an ester than a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, and upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it's hydrolyzed to the acid.

But then the NMR would show a triplet for the ester's CH3 group, which is at 1.4 ppm (d,3H) in the starting material. That doesn't fit with an ester, which would have a triplet around 1.2 ppm.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If the starting material is an ester, like methyl benzoate, the NMR would have a triplet for the CH3O group. But in the given NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which is more indicative of a CH3 attached to a CH, not an O.

So perhaps the starting material isn't an ester but a ketone with an alcohol group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a secondary alcohol with a ketone group, and the reaction oxidizes the alcohol to a ketone, but that doesn't fit the options.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the NMR and IR data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI probably doesn't change it, but none of the options make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the acid into a different compound, but I can't figure out which.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the acid to form an anhydride, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the COOH group is replaced by iodide, but that's not likely.

Another possibility: if the starting material has a bromide or chloride in the substituent, the reaction would substitute it with iodide. For example, if the substituent is CH2CH2Br, it would become CH2CH2I. But without knowing the substituent, it's hard to say.

In the given options, option C has a sec-butyl group. If the starting material had a bromide in that substituent, the reaction would replace it with iodide. But I don't see any indication of that in the NMR.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by iodide, but that would form a mono-iodinated benzene, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding iodide to the side chain, making it a longer chain. But again, none of the options reflect that.

I think I'm out of ideas. Based on the data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction doesn't change it, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting a ketone to an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a cleavage of a double bond, but the IR doesn't show a peak for a C=C stretch except for the aromatic ones.

Hmm, I think I'll have to go with option C as the product, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else, and the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving Compound X, which has given IR and NMR data, reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis of the spectroscopic data and the reaction conditions leads to the following conclusions:

### Spectroscopic Data Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - Peaks at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - A strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or a related compound.
   - Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**, **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**, **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**, and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These signals suggest the presence of a chain containing a CH group, CH₂ groups, and an ethyl group, likely part of a sec-butyl substituent.

### Reaction Analysis:
- The reaction involves **red phosphorus and HI**, which is commonly used for hydrolysis or substitution reactions. However, the exact mechanism and its effect on the starting material are unclear without additional details. The starting material appears to remain unchanged based on the data provided.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   - This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the sec-butyl group indicated by the signals at 2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   - This structure is inconsistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group (indicated by the 10.5 ppm peak) and the NMR signals for a sec-butyl group.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   - This structure matches the NMR data, including the para-substituted benzene, the carboxylic acid group, and the sec-butyl substituent. The IR data also supports the presence of a carboxylic acid and a carbonyl group. The reaction does not appear to alter the structure, leaving it unchanged.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   - This structure is inconsistent with the presence of a carboxylic acid group and does not match the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
Based on the spectroscopic data and the reaction conditions, the starting material is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not change the structure, making **Option C** the correct answer.

Answer: C
