Alright, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The options are four different formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the spectral data given.

First, let's read the problem again carefully. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring—so two substituents attached to the benzene. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester oxygen. So, the IR data tells me that one of the substituents is an ester group, probably an -OOCR group or something similar.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It says there are six signals. Let's categorize them:

1. Two signals for aromatic H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern will determine the number of distinct aromatic protons. For a para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, leading to two sets of aromatic protons (each set being equivalent). But wait, in the case of two different substituents, the symmetry could vary. Hmm, I should think about the substitution pattern.

Wait, so if it's a disubstituted benzene, the substituents could be in positions para, meta, or ortho. Let's consider the possibilities. 

But the NMR shows two aromatic signals. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two types of H environments. For a di-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the ring's symmetry would determine the number of signals. If the substituents are in para positions, the ring is less symmetrical than if they were in ortho or meta. Let me think: for a para substitution, the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs. Like, each substituent would be opposite, so the Hs adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent. Wait, no—if the substituents are different, then the Hs next to substituent A would be different from those next to substituent B. So in that case, each substituent would cause a different environment. So for a para-disubstituted benzene with two different groups, the aromatic protons would split into two groups. Each substituent
