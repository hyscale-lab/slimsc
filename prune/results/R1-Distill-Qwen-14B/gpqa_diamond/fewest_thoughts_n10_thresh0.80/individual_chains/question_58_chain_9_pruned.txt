Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when the energy is high. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what does regularization mean again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite loop integrals or other infinities that pop up. It's a way to make the calculations finite so you can renormalize them. So regularization is about handling these infinities before you absorb them into redefined parameters.

Now, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a well-known theory that's quantized and has loop corrections. I remember that in QED, you have processes like electron self-energy where you get divergences, so you need to regularize, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. These divergences are handled through renormalization—like the famous story of electrons having a "bare" mass and charge, and the observed ones are after considering the divergences.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It also involves loops and divergences, especially at high energies. I think QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work better. But wait, does it require regularization? I think it does because it's a non-abelian gauge theory with loops that can cause similar divergences as QED. So regularization is needed there too.

Superstring Theory—oh, that's a theory where particles are modeled as strings. It's a candidate for a theory of everything. Strings are extended objects, so maybe the divergences that occur in point particles are different. I heard that in string theory, the higher-order terms don't produce the same kind of divergences because of the stringy nature. Or wait, maybe they inherently cancel due to the way string interactions work. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization because the divergences are absent or handled differently.

Classical Electrodynamics (Classical ED) is the non-quantum version. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the same kind of infinities from loop diagrams because there are no loops in the classical theory. But wait, in classical ED, you can have issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge or the self-energy of a charge. These are sometimes handled with concepts like the principle of regularization, but wait, that's in the context of quantizing the theory. So in the classical theory itself, do you need regularization? I'm not so sure. Or perhaps the question is pointing to something else.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization, not which is free of divergences in any context. Regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So classical theories wouldn't require regularization because they don't have the loop integrals and such.

So let's go through the options:

A) Superstring Theory: Since it's a quantum theory, but maybe it doesn't need regularization because the underlying structure (strings) prevent
