Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

So the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, we'll observe brightness variations as the spots come into view and then move away. The question says that this situation can look like an exoplanet in terms of the light curve. They're asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if there were no spots?

Hmm, wait. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is what's important here. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. 

But in this case, the star itself has spots that affect the brightness. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to vary. The question is essentially saying that this effect of the spots on the light curve should have the same amplitude as if a planet were transiting. So we need to find the exoplanet's radius relative to the star's radius such that the transit depth (the dip in brightness) is the same as the maximum dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but the star's spots are cooler. So when the spots are facing towards us, the star appears slightly dimmer than when the unspotted area is visible. So the dip in brightness is due to the spots being cooler. But the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet would cause the same amplitude. So the amplitude is the difference between the star's maximum and minimum brightness.

Let me think about how the spots affect the observed flux. The star's total brightness is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area. The flux from each portion depends on their temperature.

The star's effective temperature is Teff = 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K.

The filling factor is 20%, which means 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. So 0.2 of the surface is spots, and 0.8 is normal.

The flux from a star (or any blackbody) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4. So the total flux without any spots would be F0 = σ*(6000)^4.

But with spots, the total flux F is F = (0.8 * F0) + (0.2 * F_spots), where F_spots = σ*(5000)^4.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Wait, no—since the star is rotating, different parts of the star's surface are visible. The way the question describes it, the star has one hemisphere with spots—so when it's viewed edge-on, the spots come into view and then go away as the star rotates. So the variation in brightness would be due to the spots moving in and out of the observer's line of sight.

Wait, but in reality, the spots would rotate into and out of view depending on the rotation period. But perhaps the star is observed in such a way that the maximum brightness variation is when the spots are either fully visible or fully hidden, depending on the rotation phase.

Wait, no. The star's brightness variation would be periodic with the rotation period. The amplitude of the variation would depend on the change in flux due to the spots being visible or not. Let's model it.

Without any spots, the star's flux is F0 = σ*(6000)^4 * (Surface Area). But when spots are present, the flux is F = (unspotted area * F0) +
