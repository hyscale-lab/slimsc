Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Oh right, stereoisomers include things like cis-trans isomerism and optical isomers.

The problem has two parts: part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. So the options are four, each pairing possible answers for A and B.

The compounds given are benzoquinone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and dimethyl fumarate.

Let me tackle part A first. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different isomers, right? Like in ketones and aldehydes, or maybe in some amino acid structures. Wait, but when does a compound not show tautomerism?

Benzoquinone. I think benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, a diketone. Wait, wait, no, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Oh, wait, no. Benzoquinone is actually a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. So, like o-benzoquinone, which is 1,2-benzoquinone, or p-benzoquinone (1,4). In any case, it has two ketone groups on the benzene ring.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groupsâ€”so every other carbon is a ketone. So, 1,3,5-cyclohexane trione.

Wait, which of these can show tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen between two atoms, like between O and C or N and C. So, in a ketone, can it tautomerize? Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, tautomerism is more common in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups. Wait, like in diketones or something else. For example, in o-diketones, maybe.

Benzoquinone: it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, in the case of 1,2-benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are adjacent. That might allow for tautomerism. Because the hydrogen from the benzene ring (if any) could shift. Wait, wait, but in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons. So, perhaps there's a possibility of keto-enol tautomerism? Or maybe not, because the molecule is already a diketone; maybe it doesn't undergo tautomerism.

Wait, I'm
