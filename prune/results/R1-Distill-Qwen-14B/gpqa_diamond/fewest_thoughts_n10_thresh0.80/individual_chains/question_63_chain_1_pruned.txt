Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will take the molecule to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state. I think that refers to the state with the lowest possible energy for the molecule. So the current state is the ground state. When it absorbs a photon, it'll move to the next state with the lowest energy—probably the first excited state.

Hmm, I remember that the energy levels in a diatomic molecule like this involve both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the model used here is the rotation-vibration model, which, if I'm not mistaken, combines both rotational and vibrational energies. Or maybe it's the non-rigid rotor model which allows the bond length to change slightly, affecting the moment of inertia. Right, the non-rigid rotor is an extension of the rigid rotor model where the bond isn't perfectly rigid.

But the question is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next. In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = (ħ² * (J)(J+1)) / (2I), where J is the rotational quantum number. For the rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, and the next state is J=1. But wait, if the molecule is in its fundamental state, that's the state with the lowest energy, which would be the ground vibrational state (n=0) and ground rotational state (J=0).

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "next state with the lowest possible energy." Let me think. The energy states are quantized both in rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 (vibrational ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). The next state could be either increasing J or increasing n. But since the problem is about a photon absorption, which usually involves transitions between vibrational states, but sometimes rotational as well.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The next state would be the first excited state, which would have the next highest energy. So I think it's the next energy level, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. So I have to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next higher state.

Wait, but the options are all about momentum, not energy. So I need to find the photon's momentum that would cause the molecule to transition from the ground state to the next higher state.

But wait, photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. Because for photons, E=pc. So if I can find the energy difference between the two states, I can find the momentum.

So the problem reduces to finding the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state, and then using E = pc to find p.

But which transition are we considering? Let me think. The molecule is in its fundamental state. So that's the state with the lowest
