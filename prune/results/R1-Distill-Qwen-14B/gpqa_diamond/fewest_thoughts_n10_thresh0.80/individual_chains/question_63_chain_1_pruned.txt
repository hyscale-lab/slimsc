Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations, but this mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think includes both rotation and vibration. The question is about the momentum a photon must have so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest energy state. Wait, the fundamental state for a diatomic might mean the state with the lowest vibrational and rotational energies. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh wait, for the vibration part, the fundamental state is usually the first vibrational state, n=0, right? Or wait, no, wait— the ground state is n=0, so the fundamental state is n=0. But the question is about absorbing a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in the ground state, and it's going to the next state, which must be the first excited state.

But wait, the problem says it can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so it's considering both rotation and vibration. Hmm, the non-rigid rotor model — I think that's sometimes called the rotation-vibration coupling model, where the rotation and vibration are considered together. But wait, another thought: the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, while the non-rigid rotor (or vibrating rotor) allows for bond length changes, hence coupling rotation and vibration. So the energy levels would be a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

But the question seems to be about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So the molecule is in its fundamental state (probably the lowest vibrational state, n=0, and the lowest rotational state, J=0) and needs to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next state with the lowest energy would be the next higher energy state. But which one? Because each state can be characterized by quantum numbers. For a diatomic, the energy levels are given by both rotational (J) and vibrational (n) quantum numbers.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) * J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. And for the harmonic oscillator (vibrational model), E_vib = ħω(n + 1/2). So the total energy is the sum of these two. But the problem says it's using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the Morse potential model, which includes both rotation and vibration, and the energy levels are more complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering a non-rigid rotor where the bond length can vary, so the moment of inertia isn't fixed.

Wait, but the question is about the photon's momentum. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule gains energy. The photon's energy must match the transition from the current state to the next higher state. So the energy of the photon should correspond to the difference between the initial and final states.

But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state with the lowest possible quantum numbers. So for rotation, J=0 (since that's the lowest). For vibration, n=0 as well. So the molecule is in the state (J=0, n=0).

The next state with the lowest possible energy—what's the next state? The next higher energy state. But which one is higher in energy: increasing J or increasing n? Because the energy levels for rotation and vibration are different.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) hν. So if the molecule is in (J=0, n=0), the next higher state could be either J=1, n=0 or J=0, n=1. Which one has lower energy?

We need to compare the energies of these two possible transitions.

Let me compute the energies. Let's first find the rotational constant B.

The rotational constant B is given by (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μr², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I should convert this into kilograms because the units for Planck's constant are in SI units. Let me think.

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Then B = (ħ²)/(2I). ħ is hbar, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2064e-46) = (1.112e-68)/(2.4128e-46) ≈ 4.61e-23 J s².

Wait, no, let me compute that again. Wait, 1.112e-68 divided by 2.4128e-46 is approximately (1.112 / 2.4128) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J s². Wait, no, wait: 1e-
