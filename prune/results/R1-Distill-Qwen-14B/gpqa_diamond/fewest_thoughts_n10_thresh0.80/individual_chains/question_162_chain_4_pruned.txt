Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric in terms of x and y? Or maybe it's a coordinate system that's embedded in some higher dimension? I'm not sure, but I'll proceed.

Wait, pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D Minkowski space, but in this case, maybe it's a 2D surface with an induced metric. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a 2D surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the metric is conformally flat because it's in the form of (something) times (dx² + dy²). The something is the conformal factor. So the area element in a conformally flat metric is just the conformal factor times dx dy. So the area would be the integral of the conformal factor over the region where the metric is defined.

So the metric is given by ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - x² - y²). To find the area, I need to integrate this factor over the region where the denominator is positive, because otherwise the metric would be singular or imaginary.

So 4 - x² - y² must be greater than zero. That implies x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Because 4 is 2 squared, so the maximum x² + y² is 4.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Hmm.

Wait, when you have an integral like this, it's often easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

The integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute that. The θ integral is straightforward: it's 2π. So the area is 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the radial integral. Let me set u = 4 - r², so du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr.

Wait, but when r=0, u=4, and when r=2, u=0. So the integral from r=0 to r=2 becomes the integral from u=4 to u=0 of [32/(u)] * (-du/2).

Wait, let's see. The integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. Let's rewrite it as 32 ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r². Then, du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr. So, the integral becomes:

32 * ∫ [1/u ] * (-1/2) du.

But wait, the limits when r=0, u=4, and when r=2, u=0. So the limits would go from u=4 to u=0. So the integral becomes:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 of (1/u) du.

Which is the same as 32*(1/2) ∫ from 0 to 4 of (1/u) du because the negative flips the limits. So 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4.

Wait, but the integral of 1/u from 0 to 4 is divergent because as u approaches 0, 1/u
