Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. Let me try to break down the information given.

First, there's a bright-red substance A1. It decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oxygen-freeze point (ɷF) of A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what ɷF means. Wait, maybe it's the melting point or something else? Oh wait, ɷF sometimes stands for the oxygen-freezing point, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, could it be the fluorine content percentage? Maybe. So A2 is a compound with 31.96% fluorine by mass?

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. When it reacts with xenon, perhaps it's acting as an oxidizing agent, maybe converting xenon into a higher oxidation state, like XeF4 or something.

Then there's A3, which can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So Y is being reacted with fluorine to form A3. So A3 is another binary compound of Y and F.

Next, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. I'm not sure what that means yet.

The question is about the molecular weight of A4. The options are ranges: 140-160, 220-240, 160-180, 110-130.

Wait, let's think about possible elements Y. The compounds are binary with fluorine. Five such compounds are known. I'm trying to think of an element that forms five binary fluorides. Let's see:

Possible candidates: perhaps Y is chlorine? Or maybe another halogen. Wait, chlorine has several fluorides, but maybe not five. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen? Wait, no, oxygen tends to form more oxides. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The bright-red substance A1 that decomposes into A2 and F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent, but maybe A1 is a compound. Wait, fluorine in higher oxidation states? Hmm.

Wait, what about ClF3? No, not red. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF3 or something else. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So A1 is
