Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a certain reaction. Let me break it down.

First, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. So the numbering goes like 1, 2, 3, etc., around the ring.

At position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is a CHO group. And at position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH₂=CH- group. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the substituent is 5-vinyl, which would be attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the structure would have a ring with double bonds, and these substituents attached.

Wait, the base structure is cyclohex-3-ene. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 on the ring. So the ring is like 1, 2 (with a formyl), 3 (double bond to 4), then 5 (with vinyl), and 6. So positions 2 and 5 are across from each other, I think.

So the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group at C2 and a vinyl group at C5. Plus, there's a carboxylic acid group somewhere—wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Because in cyclohexenecarboxylic acid, the numbering starts so that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. So position 1: COOH, position 2: CHO, position 5: CH₂CH₂ (vinyl is CH₂=CH- so maybe it's -CH₂CH₂- but actually, vinyl is -CH₂CH₂- group attached via the double bond? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is -CH₂CH₂- attached to the ring. Wait, no,
