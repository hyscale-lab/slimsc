Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius, so it's a solid at room temperature but just barely. 

Another clue is that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, that makes me think of something like a strong base or maybe a reducing agent. 

So, let's think about each part. Let's start with the gas W. Its molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule is probably something like H2O because H has 1 proton and O has 8. Wait, no, because H2O has H (1 p, 0 n) and O (8 p, 8 n). So each H contributes 1 p and 0 n, O has 8 p and 8 n. Total protons: 2 + 8 = 10, neutrons: 0 + 8 =8. Oh, that's not equal. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. Maybe NH3? NH3 has 1 N (7 p, 7 n) and 3 H (each 1 p, 0 n). So total protons: 7 +3*1=10, neutrons:7 + 0=7. Not equal. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Carbon has 6 p and 6 n (since C-12 is the usual isotope). O has 8 p and 8 n. So CO2 would have 6+8*2=22 p and 6 + 8*2=22 n. Oh wait, so each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So the molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. That fits. But wait, CO2 is a gas, but when would it be released from a reaction?

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CH4? No, because then protons would be 6 (C) +4*1 (H) =10. Neutrons would be 6 (C) +4*0=6. Not equal. So wait, maybe the gas is something else. Another thought: maybe it's H2 (but that's 2 p, 0 n). Doesn't fit. Or O2: 16 p and 16 n? No, O2 would have 16 p and 16 n (since each O is 8 p, 8 n). So two O atoms would make 16 p and 16 n. So each O2 molecule has 16 p and 16 n. So that would make them equal. Hmm. So W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is diatomic. So the molecule has 16 p and 16 n. So that fits the condition. So gas W is O2? Or maybe another diatomic gas like Cl2? Cl has
