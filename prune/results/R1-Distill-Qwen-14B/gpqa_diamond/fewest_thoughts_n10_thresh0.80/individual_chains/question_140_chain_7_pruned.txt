Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G is formed. When G is heated, it releases B, and B has a melting point close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also a reagent. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, think about the reaction between X and Y. When they react, a gas W is released. W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases that fit this. Water is H2O, but that's not a gas in its liquid form. Wait, no, the reaction releases gas W, so W is a gas. So what is a common gas where each molecule has equal protons and neutrons?

Hydrogen gas (H2) would have 1 proton each, but no neutrons (since H is ¹H). So each molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons—no, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe another element. Let's see: Helium is He, which is a noble gas, but a monoatomic molecule. So each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since He has atomic number 2, and isotope He-4). So each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so each molecule (He) has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That fits the condition—same number of protons and neutrons. So gas W is helium? But wait, does the reaction produce helium? That's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's another gas.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? No, that's not a gas in the same way. Or maybe CO2? No, let's think about the number of protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe H2O? Let's see: H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and an O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So in a molecule of H2O, protons would be 2+8=10, neutrons would be 0+8=8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is carbon monoxide (CO)? CO has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if ¹²C) and 1 O (8 p, 8 n if ¹⁶O). So each molecule would have 6+8=14 protons and 6+8=14 neutrons. Oh, that fits! But wait, CO is a gas, but when would X react with Y to produce CO? Alternatively, maybe it's another gas. Or perhaps the gas
