Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember that stars emit light based on their temperature, and something about the excitation of atoms in their photosphere. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer where photosynthesis happens, but wait, that's plants. No, for stars, it's the outer layer from which light escapes. Right.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's a specific value they gave, but might not be directly needed for the equation.

Since the stars are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I think the Boltzmann equation applies here. The Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j. Here, the problem says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So for star_1, the population ratio (n_upper / n_lower) would be 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe for the same energy level, the population in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for each star, the ratio is n1/n2 = 2? Or perhaps it's that the excitation of a specific level is twice as much, so the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, let's clarify. Let's say the two energy levels are E1 and E2, and the energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. For each star, the ratio of atoms in E2 to E1 is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star 1: (n2_1)/(n1_1) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )
Similarly, for star 2: (n2_2)/(n1_2) = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

But
