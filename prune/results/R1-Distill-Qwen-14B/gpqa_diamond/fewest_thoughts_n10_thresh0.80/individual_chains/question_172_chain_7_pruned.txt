Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms. Let me try to break it down.

So, the problem says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when we talk about excitation, it's often related to the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution explains the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities, g is the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, I think the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's call that delta E. So delta E = E_i - E_j. Since the question says the atoms are twice as excited in star_1, that means n_i for star_1 is twice n_i for star_2. So (n1_i)/(n2_i) = 2.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, because in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in that level. So the ratio of the populations is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2 for that specific energy level. 

Assuming LTE, each star's photosphere follows the Boltzmann equation independently. So for star_1, (n1_i)/(n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -delta E/(k T1) ), and similarly for star_2.

But wait, I think the problem is assuming that the ratio of the same energy levels for the two stars is given. So perhaps the ratio (n1_i / n1_j) divided by (n2_i / n2_j) equals 2, because n1_i = 2 * n2_i and n1_j would be n2_j if the other level is the same. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of excitation between the two stars is given. So (n1_i / n1_j
