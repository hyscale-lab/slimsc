Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Like, the formula is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

Now, the sky is assumed to have a uniform distribution of stars. So, stars are spread out evenly in space. How does that affect the number we observe with a certain parallax range?

Imagine a spherical shell around the Earth. Each shell has a certain thickness, and the number of stars in each shell depends on the volume. Oh right, because stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a shell is proportional to the volume of the shell.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But since we're considering a thin shell, the volume would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area is 4πr², so the volume of the shell is 4πr² * dr, where dr is the thickness.

If the parallax is plx, then the distance r is 1/plx parsecs. So the radius of the shell is r = 1/plx. The next shell would be at r + dr, which would correspond to plx + dplx. Wait, no, because plx and r are inversely related. Let me think: if r = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. Hmm, because plx is 1/r, so dplx = - dr/(r²) = - (dr)(plx²). Wait, maybe I should express dr in terms of dplx.

Alternatively, since plx is 1/r, then dplx would be the change in 1/r when r changes by dr. So, dplx = - (dr)/(r²). So dr = - r² dplx. Oh, because dr is positive when r increases, and dplx would be negative because as r increases, plx decreases. So to get the volume element in terms of plx, let's see.

The volume element in terms of r is 4πr² dr. Sub
