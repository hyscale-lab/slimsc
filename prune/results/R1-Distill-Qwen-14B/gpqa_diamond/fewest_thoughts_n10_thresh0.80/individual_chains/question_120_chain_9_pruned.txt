Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is 1/plx parsecs. So plx = 1/d.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. I'm assuming it's looking for the number density, like how many stars fall into a certain plx interval. So if I have a small change in plx, say dplx, I want to find how many stars are in that interval.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their spatial density is uniform. Wait, no, uniform in what sense? Maybe uniform in terms of volume. So the number of stars depends on the volume of space you're looking at. But how does parallax come into play here?

Let me think about the relation between distance and the number of stars. If you imagine looking at the sky, as you go further away, each shell at distance d has a larger volume. So the number of stars in each shell would depend on the volume of that shell.

The volume of a spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to d² dd, assuming a uniform density of stars.

But we're dealing with parallax, not distance. So let's express everything in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So the volume expression becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 (d(1/plx)) ). Wait, no, wait. The thickness in distance terms is dd, so in parallax terms, what's the change dplx?

Hmm, I need to relate dd and dplx. Let's take derivatives. Since d = 1/plx, then dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So, dd = - dplx / (plx)^2. Wait, but since plx is positive, and as plx increases, d decreases, so the negative makes sense for direction, but for the magnitude, it's just dplx/(plx)^2.

So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * [dplx/(plx^2)].

Wait, let me check: the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. Here, r is d, which is 1/plx. So substituting, dr is d(1/plx) = (-1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx^2)) ) = 4π (dplx) / (plx^4).

Wait, that gives 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars in a small plx interval dplx is proportional to (dplx) / plx^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so that would be the number of stars per dplx. So the number density, N, is N = (dN/dplx) = (number of stars in dplx) / dplx. So dN/dplx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait no, wait a second. Because the number of stars is dN = n * 4π (d)^2 dd, where n is the number density (stars per volume). So dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(1/plx^2)) ). Because dd = d(1/plx) = (-1/plx^2) dplx. So the absolute value, the magnitude is (1/plx^2) dplx.

So putting that together, dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / (1/plx^2)) )

Wait, that simplifies to n *4π * (1/plx)^2 * (dplx * plx^2) ) = n *4π dplx.

Wait, that can't be right because then dN would be proportional to dplx, which would mean the number per unit plx is constant (since dN/dplx = n *4π ). But that doesn't make sense because when plx increases (distance decreases), you expect more stars in a given plx range since you're looking at a smaller volume.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Let me try again. The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd multiplied by the number density n (stars per cubic parsec, say).

So dN = n * 4π d² dd.

But d = 1/plx, so substituting:

dN = n *4π (1/plx)^2
