Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The problem states that the Hamiltonian operator is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. I remember that Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and when you take their dot product with a unit vector, it's like creating a matrix in the direction of that vector.

Wait, the eigenvalues of a spin operator... Oh right, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues of ±1. But wait, in this case, it's not just one Pauli matrix, it's a combination. So H is essentially the dot product between σ and some direction n, scaled by ε.

I think the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1 because σ · n is a spin operator in the direction of n. Since each Pauli matrix's eigenvalues are ±1, their combination along any direction would also have eigenvalues ±1. But wait, isn't that only when considering the spin without any scaling?

So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then when you multiply it by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε. Because scaling a matrix by a constant multiplies each eigenvalue by that constant.

Let me double-check. The general form of such a Hamiltonian is H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Each Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. So the matrix σ · n is a 2x2 matrix which, when diagonalized, has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, multiplying by ε gives eigenvalues ±ε. 

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε, which matches what I'm thinking. Option C has ε multiplied by hbar over 2, but I don't think that's the case here. Oh wait, why would hbar come into play? Because in some contexts, like when dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Oh wait, but wait! Wait a second. The Pauli matrices themselves don't have the ħ in them. Because in the standard representation, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are just 2x2 matrices with elements like [[0,1],[1,0]], etc
