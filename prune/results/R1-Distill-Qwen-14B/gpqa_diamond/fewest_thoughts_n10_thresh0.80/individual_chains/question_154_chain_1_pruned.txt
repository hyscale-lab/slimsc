Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the scenario is that a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and he has some spectral data to help identify it. The options are four different compounds, and I need to pick the right one based on the given information.

Let's start by looking at the data provided.

First, the mass spectrometry (MS) data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, molecular ion is usually the molecular weight, but sometimes isotopic peaks can come into play. Wait, molecular weight is 156. Then, the peak at m/z 158 is likely a fragment or maybe a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and 25% for 37Cl. So, if the molecule has a Cl atom, the molecular ion would have two possible peaks: one at 156 (35Cl) and another at 158 (37Cl), each with about 75% and 25% respectively. But wait, in the molecular ion, the intensity ratio of the peaks would be 3:1 (since 35Cl is more abundant). But the problem states the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), and the 158 is a separate peak. Wait, maybe the 158 isn't the molecular ion. So perhaps the molecular weight is 156, and the 158 is a fragment.

Wait, let me think: when the molecular ion breaks apart, it can produce different fragments. For example, if there's a Cl atom, losing Cl would give a fragment with m/z = original M - 35 (assuming the Cl is 35). But wait, the molecular ion is 156, and if it loses Cl (35), the fragment would be 121. But the given 158 is higher than 156, so that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a Cl and some other groups that increase the mass beyond the molecular ion? Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's hold onto that thought and look at other data.

Next, the IR spectrum. It shows a broad peak between 3500 and 2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate either an -OH group (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe an amine. But the presence of a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 (broad), and their carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1. Alternatively, an ester or an aldehyde would have a carbonyl around there as well.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because in the NMR, carboxylic protons are typically around 10-12 ppm and show as a singlet because they don't have neighboring hydrogens. So that suggests there's a -COOH group somewhere in the molecule.

- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring because each pair of protons is equivalent and coupled with each other. So, this looks like a para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is a benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at 2. So, that would be o-hydroxybenzaldehyde with a Cl in the meta. But wait, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have the structure where the benzaldehyde is at position 1, then Cl at position 3 (which is meta to the aldehyde?), and OH at position 2 (ortho to the aldehyde). Hmm, but that might not give a para substitution. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in para positions on the ring.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That would be benzoic acid where Cl is at the para position. So, the ring has a COOH group at position 1 and Cl at position 4. The NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons, which is what we're seeing here. Also, the IR would show the broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and the strong carbonyl.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That would be a benzene ring with a chloroformate group, which is OCOCl attached. The structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. The NMR would show aromatic protons, but would the protons be in a para arrangement? If the chloroformate is attached to the ring, the adjacent positions would be substituted, but I'm not sure how that would look. Also, the 11 ppm proton - chloroformate would have an OCOCl group, but that's more of an ester or perhaps a carbamate. The molecular weight would be different as well. Let's calculate the molecular weights.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. That would have Cl at position 2 relative to the COOH group. So the ring substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic protons would then be in the ortho and para positions relative to Cl, which might give different NMR signals. Let's see.

Wait, let's compute molecular weights for each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO. Adding Cl and OH.

Wait, benzaldehyde has molecular formula C7H6O. Adding Cl (35.5) and OH (17): but wait, the molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2 (since benzaldehyde is C7H6O, and adding Cl and OH would take away a H and add O). So molecular weight is (12*7) + (5*1) + 35.5 + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is 156, so that's close but might not fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl, so molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12*7=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Again, about 156.5, but the molecular ion is 156. Maybe the 156 is the M+ peak, and the 158 is [M+Cl] or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is causing the isotopic peak.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156 (100%). The other peak is at 158 (32%). That suggests that the molecular ion plus two protons? Or perhaps that is a fragment. Wait, another possibility is that the 158 is the molecular ion with a Cl isotope. So, if the molecular weight is 156, and the Cl is present, the M would be 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). So in that case, the molecular ion would have 75% (for 35Cl) and 25% (for 37Cl). But the problem says the molecular ion is 100%, which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the 158 is the molecular ion plus an isotope, but perhaps the main M is 158? No, wait the MS says molecular ion is at 156 (100%). So that's the base peak.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think again. The options' molecular weights:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight = 7*12 +5*1 +35.5 + 16*2 = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. So approximately 156.5, which would round to 156 or 157. The molecular ion is at 156, so that's close.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula as A: C7H5ClO2. So same molecular weight, about 156.5.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. Molecular formula is C6H5COCl, which is C7H5ClO2. Same as the others. Molecular weight same as above.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula, same molecular weight.

So all options have same molecular formula? So the molecular ion is 156, but all options have M+ of about 156.5, which would be 156 when considering the integer masses. So the molecular ion is 156, which is correct for all options.

Wait, but the other peak at 158 is 32% relative to the 156 peak. So perhaps that's the M+2 peak due to chlorine? Chlorine's isotopic abundance is about 24.22% for 37Cl. So if the molecule has one Cl, the M+2 would be about 24% of the M peak. But in the data, the 158 peak is 32%, which is a bit higher than 24%. Hmm, doesn't quite match. Alternatively, perhaps it's not an isotope but a fragment. I'm not sure.

But looking back, the 1H NMR might give more clues. Let's look at that.

We have a singlet at
