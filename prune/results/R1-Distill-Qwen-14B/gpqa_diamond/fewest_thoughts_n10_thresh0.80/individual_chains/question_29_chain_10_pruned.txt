Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley and some gene mutation. Hmm, let's try to unpack it.

The question says that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. That's bad because people can't use it for food. So they found the gene responsible for making this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the gene sequence in the mutants.

The target gene's sequence is given, and there are four mutants. We need to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think the idea is that the mutation disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change in the first exon area. Exons are the parts that code for proteins, so any mutation here could affect the protein structure.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGTâ€¦TGA. Let me write out the regions where the mutants have changes.

Mutant 1:
ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA
Wait, comparing to the intact gene. Let's see, the first part of the intact gene after ATG is TTTCTCGC...

In Mutant 1, it's TTCTACGC. So, the third to sixth nucleotides change. Let me write the original: positions 3-6 are T T C T C G... Wait, maybe I should line it up.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the sequences differ. Let's see:

Original (intact):
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Let me check each mutant:

Mutant 1:
ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA
Wait, perhaps I should compare each part. The first part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

In Mutant 1, the beginning is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT. So the change is in the TTTCTC part. Wait, maybe the original after ATG is TTTCTCGC. So in Mutant 1, it's TTCTACGC? Let me see:

Original nucleotides 4-9: T T C T C G
Mutant 1: T T C T A C?

Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTA...
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTA...

So, in the
