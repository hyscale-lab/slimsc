Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, right?

Hmm, the setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And c is given as 1, which makes sense because in a vacuum, light speed is c. But here it's in glass, so the speed should be less than c.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving. How does that affect the speed of light inside it? I remember something about the Doppler effect, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Oh, wait, the Doppler effect is about frequency changes when the source or observer is moving, but here the medium itself is moving.

Wait no, the medium is moving. So in this case, the glass is moving, which is the medium through which light is propagating. So when the medium moves, does that affect the speed of light in it?

I think the key here is to consider how the speed of light in the medium relates to the frame of the medium versus the lab frame. Because in the glass's rest frame, light travels at speed v_glass = c/n. But when the glass is moving, we have to transform this speed into the lab frame.

Wait, but in relativity, velocities don't just add up
