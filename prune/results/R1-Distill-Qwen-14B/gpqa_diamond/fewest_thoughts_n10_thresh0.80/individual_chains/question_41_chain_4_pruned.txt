Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through glass that's moving. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with light and moving media, there are some relativistic effects to consider. Let me try to break this down.

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, I think the key here is to consider how the speed of light is measured in different frames. I remember that according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant in all inertial frames. But here, it's in glass, which has a refractive index, so the speed would be less than c. Oh wait, but the glass is moving, so how does that affect it?

Oh right, when a medium is moving relative to an observer, you have to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c divided by n.

So the speed of the light within the glass is c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So the observer is in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v towards them. Wait, noâ€” the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is moving in
