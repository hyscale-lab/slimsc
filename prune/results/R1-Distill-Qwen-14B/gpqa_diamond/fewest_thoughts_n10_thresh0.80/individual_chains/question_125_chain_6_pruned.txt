Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about a particle of mass m in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². That sounds familiar—it's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because Hooke's law is involved, so the force is F = -kr, and the potential is like a spring potential. So this is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. Hmm, okay. So I need to find both the energy and the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy) for the third excited state.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, each energy level in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator has a certain degeneracy. The energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number. Or wait, no, more precisely, each direction contributes a quantum number. So for 3D, the state is described by quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, each corresponding to the energy in each direction. But since the potential is isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of these quantum numbers plus 3/2 times ħω. So E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, I think another approach is that the energy levels are quantized as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. But sometimes I've heard it as n_x + n_y + n_z = n, which gives the same E.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The energy levels are actually E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So each direction contributes n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the total n is n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, but I think I might have mixed up two different approaches. Alternatively, in three dimensions, the states are labeled by the principal quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So each energy level corresponds to a particular n.

Wait, but let me check: the ground state would be n=0, with E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be n=1, E=(1+3/2) = 5/2, then n=2, E=7/2, and so on.

So the third excited state would be... Let
