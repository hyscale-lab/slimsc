Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator given by H = ε σ · n, where σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, right?

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So the dot product σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Oh right, σ · n is a matrix itself because each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 matrix. So the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ε.

I think the eigenvalues of a spin operator like this can be found using the properties of the Pauli matrices. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you take a linear combination like σ · n, what's the eigenvalue then?

Oh wait, σ · n is a vector in the Bloch sphere direction. The eigenvalues of such an operator should be the components of the spin in that direction. Since the Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1, when you have σ · n, the eigenvalues are ±1 because n is a unit vector. So when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1, but when you take their linear combination, the overall matrix's eigenvalues are what? Let me consider a general case. Suppose H = aσ_x + bσ_y + cσ_z, where a² + b² + c² = 1 (since n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² +n_z² =1). Or wait, actually, in the problem, it's ε (σ · n), so the coefficients are ε multiplied by each component of n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum of squares is 1, so the coefficients squared would be ε² n_x² + ... which sums to ε².

But for the eigenvalues, I think the operator σ · n is a unit vector direction, so the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1. Then, H = ε (σ · n), so the eigenvalues would be ε times ±1, so ±ε. That would be option B.

Wait, but wait another thought. The spin matrices
