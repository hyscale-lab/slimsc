Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds from their NMR spectra. Let me read it again.

The problem says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm, so the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check what each option's molecular formula would be. All the options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Aromatic compounds with four methyl groups: each methyl is CH3. Benzene is C6H6, so each substitution adds a CH3. So for four methyl groups, each substitution contributes one CH3.

Wait, but the molecular formula for each compound is C10H14. Let's see: Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is -CH3. So, for each substitution, we add a CH2 group because the benzene loses a hydrogen when substituting. Wait, actually, when a benzene ring has a substituent, each substitution replaces a hydrogen. So, benzene has six H. Each substitution replaces one, so for n substituents, the formula would be C6H6-n plus whatever the substituent brings.

Wait, but the substituent is like -CH3 in this case. So each substituent adds a CH3. So benzene is C6H6. Each methyl substitution adds C1 and H3, but subtracts H1. So for each substituent, the formula becomes C7H5 for one substituent, but wait that's not right because each substituent is a -CH3 group. So for benzene plus four methyl groups: the formula would be C6 + 4*(C1) = C10, and H: 6 -4 (since each substitution replaces a H) + 4*(3) = 6-4 +12 =14. So yes, each compound is C10H14. That matches the question.

Now, the NMR. The aromatic region has two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in 1:1 ratio. Wait, no, the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio, but each is a singlet. So each signal corresponds to a particular set of protons.

In aromatic compounds, substituents can create different environments for the protons. If there are equivalent protons, they'll show as a singlet. So, for example, in para-substitution, the protons can be equivalent.

Wait, but the aromatic signals are singlets and at 6.7 ppm. So maybe each of the compounds has only one type of aromatic proton? Because if a compound has more than one type, you'd see more than one signal in the aromatic region.

Wait, but in the mixture,
