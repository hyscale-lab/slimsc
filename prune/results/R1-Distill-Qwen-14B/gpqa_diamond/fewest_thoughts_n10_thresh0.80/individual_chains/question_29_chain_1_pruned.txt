Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is that there's this barley cultivar that's drought-resistant, which is good, but it has an anti-nutritional compound that's bad. The problem is that this compound makes it unsuitable for food. The researchers found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequenced the target gene in all the mutants. The changes are in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think the idea is that the compound is synthesized because the gene is active, so if the gene's function is disrupted, the compound won't be made.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the first exon. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutation there could potentially change the protein product.

First, I should compare the wild-type sequence to each mutant. Let's break down the given sequences.

Wild-type (intact gene) sequence starts with:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing to wild-type, looking at the beginning:

Wild: ATGTTTC TCGC TGGTA...
Mutant1: ATGTTCT ACGC TGGTA...

Wait, let me look at the exact difference. Let's write the wild-type and mutant1 side by side.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, perhaps I should line them up more precisely. Let me count the bases.

Alternatively, perhaps more efficient to look for where the changes are.

Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTCTA CGC... whereas wild is ATGTTTCT C GCT...

Wait, perhaps the first six nucleotides of the wild-type are ATGTTT, and mutant1 is ATGTTCT? Wait, let me count:

Wild starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT...

Mutant1 starts: ATG TTT CT ACG C TGG TAC T...

Wait, perhaps the first part has a change from CTC GCT to CTA CGC? Or perhaps a point mutation. Let me see the exact nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps the first part is:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG ...

Wait, so the first part is:

Wild: position 4-7: TTT C

Mutant1: TCT A?

Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look for the specific nucleotide changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to see which mutation creates a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated nonfunctional protein. Or perhaps which mutation disrupts the reading frame, causing a frameshift, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but looking at the sequences, I don't see any insertions or deletions. All the sequences start and end similarly, so perhaps it's a substitution mutation, not a frameshift.

So, each mutant has a substitution in the first exon. Let's check for each mutant whether the substitution leads to a stop codon or significantly changes the amino acid.

Looking at the wild-type, the first few codons are:

ATG (start, methionine)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
...

So, the wild-type starts with Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser-Val-Asp-Glu-His...

Now, checking each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Looking at their sequence:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...
So, the first few codons:

ATG (Met)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu) [same as wild-type's CTC? No, CTC is Leu, CTA is also Leu. So same amino acid?]
CGC (Arg)
TGG (Trp)
TAC (Tyr)
TTCT (but wait, codons are in triplets. Oh wait, perhaps I should split the sequence into triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the first part of the wild-type is the same as the mutant's, but perhaps a substitution occurs.

Wait, perhaps the wild-type is:

5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GA A... etc.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C TGG TAC TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps the first substitution is at position 5:

Wild: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ...CTA CGC TGG TAC...

Wait, perhaps the exact change is in the third codon:

Wild third codon is CTC (Leu), Mutant1's third codon is CTA (Leu), same amino acid.

Wait, but then after that, the wild-type has GCT (Ala), but Mutant1 has CGC (Arg). Hmm, so that's a change. GCT to CGC: GCT is Ala, CGC is Arg. So, substitution from Ala to Arg. That's an amino acid change, but does that disrupt the function? Maybe, but perhaps not enough.

But wait, the anti-nutritional compound is being produced because the gene is functional. So, we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. So, any mutation that causes the gene not to be expressed or produces a nonfunctional protein.

Looking for a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) or a missense that disrupts a critical region.

Let me check each mutant.

Mutant 1: Change in codon 4 (if the first codon starts at 1). Let's number them.

Wild: 1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
11: CAT (His)
... etc.

Mutant1:

1: ATG (same)
2: TTT (same)
3: CTA (Leu, same as wild's CTC, since CTA is also Leu)
4: CGC (Arg) → changed from Ala to Arg
5: TGG (Trp)
6: TAC (Tyr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
... etc.

So, the fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), mutant1 is CGC (Arg). That's a substitution, but not a stop codon.

Mutant2:

Wild starts with ...C TCG C TGG TA...
Mutant2: ...C TAA G C TGG TA...

Wait, looking at the wild and mutant2 sequences:

Wild: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the
