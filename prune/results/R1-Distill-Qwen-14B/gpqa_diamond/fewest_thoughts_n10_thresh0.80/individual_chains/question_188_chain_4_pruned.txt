Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's try to think this through.

The question says the crystal has an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D, with various values.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles between the edges are the same. So it's a special case of the hexagonal crystal system or maybe a form of a cubic system with distorted angles. Hmm, not entirely sure, but I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, meaning all sides are equal and all angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees.

Interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the crystal. For a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would just be the lattice parameter 'a'. But here, the lattice is rhombohedral, so I think the interatomic distance might not be the same as the lattice parameter. Wait, or is it? Because in a simple structure, the interatomic distance is same as the lattice parameter. But in a more complex structure, maybe not. Or perhaps the given interatomic distance is the same as 'a' here. I'm a bit confused, but let's proceed.

The formula for interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by the Bragg's law formula adjusted for crystal systems. For a cubic system, it's d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, that's for cubic. But rhombohedral has different angles. Oh right, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) ( (1/a²) ) + ... terms involving the angles ... )

Wait, no. Let me think. The general formula when the crystal is not cubic is a bit more involved. I recall that the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system involves the angles. The formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos
