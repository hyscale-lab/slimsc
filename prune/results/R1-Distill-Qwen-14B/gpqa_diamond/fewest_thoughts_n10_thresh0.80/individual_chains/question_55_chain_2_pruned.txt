Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, let me recall some basics about NMR and these structures. NMR helps identify structures based on the splitting and integration of signals. So each peak tells me about the environment of the protons.

The given 1H NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm, okay. Let's start breaking this down.

The acetate group is likely the ester functional group. So the structure should be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, wait: Acetate is CH3COO-, so the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no, acetate is CH3COO-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. So, the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but in acetate, R is attached to the oxygen. So the structure is CH3COO-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, no, wait, acetate is the ester of acetic acid, so it's R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, but as an ester, it would be R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So for acetate, R' is methyl. So the ester is R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: Acetic acid is CH3COOH. Its ester would be CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. So the structure is CH3CO-O-R.

So the compound is either propenyl acetate or butenyl acetate. The options are cis or trans for each.

Looking at the options:
A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So, the structures would be:

Propenyl acetate - the R group is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but in an ester, it's connected via the oxygen. So the ester would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2- but that's butyl. Hmm, no.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but
