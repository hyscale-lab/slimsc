Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what I can do.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. I remember that when stars have spots, they can influence their effective temperature, which in turn affects the ionization state of elements in their photosphere.

So, the star's normal (without spots) parameters are 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Its effective temperature (Teff) without spots is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. So the spots are cooler regions, I guess, which brings down the average temperature.

Now, the main part: when looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2), this ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, so when there are spots, the ratio goes down. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, without spots, ratio is R1, with spots, it's R2. So the factor is R1/R2.

But wait, how do temperature changes affect the ionization and excitation states of atoms? Oh, right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ionization and excitation depend on the temperature. Lower temperatures would mean less ionization, so more neutral atoms. Wait, but wait, this is about the ratio of two specific energy levels, not ionization. So it's about the excitation.

In thermal equilibrium, the population of energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) would be exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). No, wait, the general formula is n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then n1/n2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )? Or wait, maybe I have it backwards. Let me think: for an excited state j and ground state i, with E_j > E_i. Then the ratio n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy). But if we're just considering the ratio of two levels, and assuming same statistical weights, then it's exp( (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_j - E_i.

Wait, but the question says: when the star has spots, the ratio of n(Ti level1)/n(Ti level2) decreases. So, without spots (Teff =6000 K), the ratio is higher than when there are spots (5500 K).

Wait, because when the temperature drops, the ratio n1/n2 should decrease if E2 > E1. Let me think: Using the Boltzmann factor, if E2 is higher than E1, then as temperature decreases, the exponential term exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes smaller. So n1/n2 = exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ) = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the denominator kT gets smaller, so the exponent becomes more negative, making the whole term smaller. So n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. That aligns with the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases.

But here's the thing: the transition between the two levels is at a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. So this is a transition that Ti atoms undergo. So the energy difference between the two levels is related to this wavelength.

I remember that the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So the energy difference ΔE between the two levels is hc/λ. Let me calculate that.

Wait, but the exact value of ΔE might not be necessary if I can express the ratio in terms of temperatures. Let me think about it.

The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming the same statistical weights for both levels. So if the ratio R = n1/n2, then R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, the problem
