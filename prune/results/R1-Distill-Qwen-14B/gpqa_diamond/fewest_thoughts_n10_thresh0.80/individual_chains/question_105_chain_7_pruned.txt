Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. 

So, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun—same radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of the area, and these spots are cooler. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into view and then go away, making the star's brightness vary over time. This brightness variation looks a bit like when a planet transits in front of a star, blocking some light.

The question is asking, if we didn't have these spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness change (amplitude) in the light curve? So I need to find the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar). The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm. I think the main idea here is to compare the light change caused by the spots to the change caused by a planet. 

First, let's think about what causes the brightness dip. When a spot is on the side facing us, it blocks some light—but because it's cooler, it emits less, so the total brightness would decrease when the spot is visible. Similarly, a planet would block some light when it transits, causing a dip.

Wait, but for the planet, the dip is due to the planet blocking the star's light. For the spots, the dip is because the spots themselves are cooler and thus contribute less light than the surrounding area. So both cause a dip, but perhaps in different ways.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed variation due to the spots can "closely resemble" an exoplanet. So when the star isn't covered by spots, what would be the planet's radius to make the same dip.

Wait, but the problem says that the star is covered with spots on one hemisphere, so as it rotates, the spots come into view. The brightness variations would be because the spots have a lower temperature, so when they are on the day side (facing us), the total brightness is less than when they're on the night side.

Wait, wait. No, when the star rotates and the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the spots would be on the star's surface, but the brightness would decrease because the spots are cooler. So the brightness would dip when a spot is in the part of the star we're seeing.

But when the star isn't spotted, a planet would cause a dip when it moves in front, blocking light. So to have the same amplitude in the light curve, the planet's effect must equal the spot's effect.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So I need to compute the fractional change in brightness for both cases.

For the star with spots, the brightness change is due to the presence of cooler regions. The brightness variation is because when the spots rotate into view, the total emitted light changes.

But wait, let's model this. I think the key is to compute the relative brightness change caused by the spots and set it equal to the change caused by the planet.

Let me think about each case.

Case 1: Star with spots.
The spots cover a certain area and are cooler. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total brightness is lower. Let's compute the fractional change.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The star's luminosity is L = 4πR² σ Teff^4.

The spots have an area A, which is 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, the question says the filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So each hemisphere has area 2πR², so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR²? Or wait, the entire star is
