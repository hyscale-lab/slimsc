Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm... Alright, so the setup is about a star with certain characteristics and some dark spots on it. The astronomers are observing this star, and the question is about how the brightness variations caused by these spots compare to the variations caused by an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of such a planet relative to the star so that it would produce the same brightness variation in the light curve.

Let me start by jotting down what I know.

The star's radius is equal to the Sun's. Oh wait, the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, but maybe I don't need the exact number right now. The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. The spots are covering one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%â€”so that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star is 1000 K. So the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K? Wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. Oh, wait, but the star's Teff is 6000 K. So are the spots cooler or hotter? Well, dark spots on a star are usually cooler regions, right? Like sunspots on the Sun. So the spots would be 5000 K, and the surrounding is 6000 K. 

The problem states that when the star is observed, because it's rotating, the spots come into view and then go away, causing the star's brightness to vary. And this is similar to the brightness variations caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So the task is to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same change in brightness.

Wait, but the question says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve. So basically, comparing the two scenarios: star with spots and a planet transit. We need the planet's signal to match the star's brightness dip due to the spots' rotation.

So, first, I should probably calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, figure out what planet radius would cause the same dip
