Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry question. Let's see what the question is about. It's about selecting suitable reagents for given reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones usually don't undergo nucleophilic substitution easily because the carbonyl is not a good enough leaving group. Oh, right! But maybe there's a better way. Wait, I think when you have a ketone and you treat it with something like HCN, you get a cyanohydrin. But wait, in this case, the reagent is NaCN. So maybe it's a similar reaction.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps under acidic conditions. Oh, wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. In acidic conditions, the carbonyl group is protonated, making it a better electrophile. So the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So yes, that's a cyanohydrin.

So the reaction of ketone with HCN (or CN-) under acidic conditions gives the cyanohydrin. So reagent A would be a source of H+ ions. Options A and B have A as H3O+ or HCl, which are acids. Wait, option C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, what's that used for?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Oh, wait, bisulfite is used in the hydroboration reaction, but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe it's used in the workup for something else. Alternatively, perhaps in the case of the cyanide addition, sometimes the reaction is done under basic conditions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: in the first reaction, butanone plus NaCN and A gives the cyanohydrin. So the typical conditions would be a proton source. So H3O+ would be a likely candidate for A.

Looking at the options, option A and B have A as H3O+ or H3O+ (as in the same as H3O+, which is just acid). Option C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, I'm not too sure about that.

Wait, I think when you add NaCN to a ketone, you need to have it under acidic conditions to protonate the carbonyl. So the reaction would be (CH3)2CO + HCN → (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, NaCN in acidic conditions would provide CN- and H+? Or perhaps the solution is acidic, so HCN is generated in situ.

Wait, but NaCN is a salt of a weak acid (HCN), so in water, it's basic. So maybe adding H3O+ (which is a strong acid) would make the solution acidic, protonating the carbonyl.

So for the first reaction: butanone + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So reagent A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+ or H3O+ (they're the same, so maybe the options are written differently). Wait, option A says A=H3O+, option B is also A=H3O+. So wait, looking again.

Wait, no, option A is A = H3O+, B=HCl. Option B is A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH. So the first part of the reaction would have A as H3O+, so options A and B are possible for the first part.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with B, which is H2O, to form the corresponding butanoic acid. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. What's the typical reagent for that? Oh right, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. But in this case, since the product is a carboxylic acid, the hydrolysis must be under acidic or strong acidic conditions.

Wait, the reagent B is H2O, but in the presence of an acid. So the reaction is likely acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the nitrile is converted to an amide, then further hydrolyzed, but I think under acidic conditions, the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid occurs.

So the reagent B would be an acid. Looking at the options, the options for B are HCl and CH3COOH (acetic acid) in options A and B, and HCl and CH3COOH again in C and D.

Wait, the second reaction is using B, which is H2O. So the reagent B is the acid. So the reaction is probably done in H2O with an acid catalyst.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is an acid. So in the options, B can be HCl (option A, C) or acetic acid (options B, D).

But wait, in the second reaction, the nitrile is in a molecule that also has a hydroxyl group. So, when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you have to be careful not to over-hydrolyze any other functional groups, but I think the main point is the conditions needed for the nitrile to acid conversion.

So, which acid is used? In the first part, A is H3O+ (so either option A or B). So in the second part, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Typically, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done under strong acidic conditions, like using HCl in H2O and heat, or using a strong base and acid work-up.

Alternatively, sometimes, using acetic acid as a catalyst wouldn't be strong enough. Or maybe it's okay because the reaction is done in water with an acid.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which is formed under either acidic or basic conditions but then acidified.

Wait, another approach: the first reaction uses H3O+ (so option A or B). The second uses H2O with B as the reagent, which is an acid. Looking at the options, let's see what each option suggests.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → So first reaction is acidic, second is HCl.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → First reaction acidic, second with acetic acid.

Which is correct?

In the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O, but wait, in the problem statement, the second reagent is B (H2O). Wait no, the reaction is written as: [compound] + B (H2O) → product. So perhaps B is the catalyst or acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is done in H2O with an acid as a catalyst. So B is the acid.

So when the nitrile is treated with water under acidic conditions, it hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. So the acid would be part of reagent B.

So, for reagent B, which is HCl or acetic acid. Which is more likely?

Well, HCl is a strong acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid. But for hydrolysis of nitriles, I think typically HCl is used under reflux conditions. For example, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is often done in aqueous HCl with heat.

So if the second reaction uses HCl (B=HCl), that would make sense. Which would correspond to option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) or option C (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl).

Wait, but earlier we thought A should be H3O+. So in that case, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which would seem correct.

But I need to double-check the first reaction. If A is NaHSO3, what's that for?

Wait, another thought: maybe the first reaction is using NaHSO3 as a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Or perhaps in another role.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. It's a source of bisulfite ions. I'm trying to remember if bisulfite is used in any reactions involving ketones and nitriles. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is used in the preparation of cyanohydrins?

Wait, I might be mixing things up. Another possibility: the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is usually done under acidic conditions. So H3O+ would be the correct reagent for A.

So if option A and B have A as H3O+, then they are possible. But the second reaction is what differentiates the options.

So the second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So the conditions would be acidic. Which acid is more likely?

If B is H2O with HCl (a strong acid), it's more likely to drive the reaction to completion. Acetic acid is a weaker acid, but perhaps it's enough.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which is a strong acid. So if the hydrolysis is done in aqueous HCl, the solution would be acidic, which is good for the reaction.

Alternatively, if the reaction is done in water with acetic acid, which is a weak acid, would that be enough? I'm not sure. I think HCl is more commonly used for that kind of hydrolysis.

So if that's the case, then option A (B=HCl) would be the correct choice.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl. So in that case, the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the reagent.

Wait, but I thought the first reaction required H3O+ as the acid. So why would NaHSO3 be used?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again. Another possibility: the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition, but maybe it's using a bisulfite as a catalyst or something else.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a different type of reaction. Oh, wait, another approach: the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed by adding CN- to the carbonyl group. The mechanism usually requires an acid catalyst because the carbonyl is protonated to make it a better electrophile.

So in the presence of an acid, the CN- (from NaCN and acid) attacks the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but NaCN is a salt that is basic in solution because CN- is a weak base. So in water, it would make the solution basic. So to make the solution acidic, we need to add an acid (like H3O+ or HCl) to provide H+ ions.

So for the first reaction, the acid (A) is necessary to create the acidic conditions for the nucleophilic attack.

So A must be an acid. So options C and D, which have A as NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ (since NaHSO3 in solution dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-; HSO3^- can donate a proton to become H2SO3 and a sulfate ion, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact pH here). Alternatively, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, but if we have NaHSO3 as the acid, would it provide enough H+? I'm not certain. I think H3O+ is a stronger acid and would more effectively protonate the carbonyl.

So perhaps the correct reagent for A is H3O+, which is in options A and B.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction uses B (H2O) with B being either HCl or CH3COOH. So if the correct B is HCl, then the correct option is A (A=H3O+, B=HCl), and option C (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl) would have A wrong.

Wait, but if the first reaction uses A=H3O+, which is in options A and B, but let's see what the second reaction requires.

Another thought: the second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for this are a strong acid, like HCl in water, and heat. So B should be HCl.

Therefore, the correct option is A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but I should check the options again. Option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option B is A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

So if the second reaction is done in aqueous HCl, which is a strong acid, that would make sense. Hence, option A's B is HCl, which is correct.

But wait, another possibility: sometimes in such problems, the second reaction is an oxidation. Wait, nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. But I don't think that's the case here because the product is a carboxylic acid, but the reagent is H2O with B. I think hydrolysis is the key here.

Wait, perhaps under acidic conditions, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. So the correct reagent is HCl (B=HCl), which is option A.

Alternatively, another possibility: the second reaction is using a mild acid. If the nitrile is in a position where it's sensitive to strong acids, perhaps acetic acid (B=CH3COOH) is used. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction uses a base, but that would produce a carboxylate, not the acid. So the product is the acid, so it must be under acidic conditions.

So, if the first reaction uses H3O+ and the second uses HCl, then option A is correct.

But wait, looking back, the first reaction's product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction's product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile is converted into a carboxylic acid, which is correct under hydrolysis.

So, putting it all together, the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl. So the correct option is A.


The question involves selecting suitable reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the carbonyl group of the ketone reacts with CN⁻ to form a cyanohydrin.  
   - For this reaction to proceed, acidic conditions are required to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic.  
   - Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for A, as it provides the necessary acidic environment.  
   - Options C and D, which list A as NaHSO₃, are less likely because NaHSO₃ is not typically used for this reaction.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.  
   - The reaction requires acidic conditions to facilitate the hydrolysis.  
   - HCl is a strong acid commonly used for such hydrolysis reactions, making it the most suitable choice for B.  
   - Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weaker acid and less likely to drive the reaction to completion efficiently.

By analyzing the options:  
- **Option A** (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl) satisfies both reactions, as H₃O⁺ provides the acidic conditions for the first reaction, and HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  
- **Option B** (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH) is incorrect because CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.  
- **Option C** (A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl) is incorrect because NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction.  
- **Option D** (A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH) is incorrect for the same reasons as C and because CH₃COOH is not strong enough for the second reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.  
Answer: A
