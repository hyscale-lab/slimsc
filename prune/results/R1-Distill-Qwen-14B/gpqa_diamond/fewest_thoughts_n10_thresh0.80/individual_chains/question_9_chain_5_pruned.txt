Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry stuff, but let me try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. I think it's a type of molecular symmetry where the molecule has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Oh wait, right, C3h is one of the point groups in symmetry. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Looking at the options, I have four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, the benzo-trifuran compound, and the triphenylene-trifuran compound. The options are labeled A to D, but I need to match each to their correct names.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the formula B(OiPr)3. The structure is a trigonal planar around boron, with three isopropyl groups attached. Each isopropyl group has two methyl branches. So the molecule is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. If I imagine the boron in the center, and each isopropyl group in a plane, rotating 120 degrees would make it look the same. Also, I think it has a mirror plane perpendicular to the boron's plane, but wait, the mirror plane is horizontal
