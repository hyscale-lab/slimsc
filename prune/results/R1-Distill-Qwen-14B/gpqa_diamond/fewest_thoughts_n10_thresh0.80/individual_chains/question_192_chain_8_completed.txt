Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance 's' away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor, which is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when charges are inside a conductor, the conductor's material rearranges itself. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, right, in a conductor, the charges redistribute themselves to cancel internal electric fields.

Let me think about the method of images or the shell theorem. For a point charge inside a conducting shell, the induced charges would create an external field similar to a point charge at the center. But wait, the cavity isn't centered here. Oh, the center of the cavity is offset by s from the conductor's center. That complicates things because the charge isn't at the center of the conductor.

Wait, when you have a charge inside a conducting shell that's not at the center, does that affect the electric field outside? Oh right, because the induced charges on the inner surface would be like a dipole or something, but the conductor's outer surface must remain neutral since the total charge added was just +q inside the cavity. No, wait, no, the conductor was uncharged initially. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q because the total conductor's charge must be zero (since it was uncharged initially). Wait, no, the conductor was uncharged, so if you add +q, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface +q to balance. Because the conductor is neutral overall, so inner is -q, outer is +q, so net is zero.

But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, and the charge +q is inside the cavity. So the conductor as a whole must remain neutral. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface +q.

But the cavity is not at the center, so the inner induced charge isn't uniformly distributed. It would arrange itself to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. Hmm, but the conductor is a sphere, so maybe the inner induced charge's center is somehow related.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to all the charges outside a Gaussian surface enclosing P, right? Wait, no. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the enclosed charge would be the total charge inside the conductor. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So the field outside would be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor, but wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform only if the inner charge is at the center. But in this case, the inner charge is off-center.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The conductor is a sphere, but the charge inside the cavity is not at the center. So the inner induced charge (-q) would be arranged asymmetrically. But the outer induced charge is +q, which, for a spherical conductor, the outer charge must distribute uniformly regardless of the inner arrangement because any asymmetry in inner would not affect the outer surface's uniformity. Or wait, no. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges rearrange to ensure the field inside the conductor is zero. So the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces would adjust such that the conductor's interior has no electric field.

But wait, the inner induced charge is -q, but it's asymmetric because the cavity's center is offset from the conductor's. So the inner charge distribution would have a dipole or something? Hmm, but actually, the inner surface's charge distribution will be such that the field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. So the charge distribution on the inner surface would be such that the field from +q and the inner induced charges inside the conductor cancels out. But since the conductor is a sphere, perhaps the outer surface's charge will still be uniformly distributed because any asymmetry in the inner charge would be canceled by the outer charge.

Wait, I'm recalling that for a spherical conductor, if the cavity contains a charge, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform only if the charge inside is at the center. If it's off-center, the outer surface might not be uniform. But wait, no, the outer surface should be uniform because the conductor's material allows charges to move freely, and any external influence would be from the inner induced charges. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Since the conductor's total charge is +q (because inner is -q, outer is +q), the field outside would be as if that +q were at the center of the conductor. So the field at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the field outside a charged sphere depends only on the total charge and the distance.

Wait, but the point P is in a direction that's not directly along the line between the conductor's center and the cavity's center. Because the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the centers are separated by s, and the angle is theta. Oh, but how does that affect the field?

Wait, no. Because from the outside, the conductor's charges (+q) would create a field as if all the charge were at the center. So regardless of where the inner charge is, as long as the conductor's total is +q, the field outside is the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but maybe that's not correct. Because the induced charges on the inner surface are -q, but their distribution is not uniform because the cavity is off-center. So perhaps the conductor's outer surface charge (which is +q) is no longer symmetric, leading to a different field outside.

Hmm, but the conductor is a sphere, so regardless of how the inner induced charge is distributed, the outer induced charge would still arrange itself uniformly because the conductor is a sphere, and the inner surface's asymmetry would not influence the outer. Wait, is that true?

Wait, I think I remember that the outer surface of a spherical conductor shields the inside from external fields, but in this case, the inner charge is inside the conductor. So the outer surface's charge distribution is influenced by the inner charge's position.

Wait, no. The outer surface's charge distribution is such that it makes the electric field inside the conductor zero. So the inner induced charge (-q) creates a field which, when combined with the outer induced charge, results in zero field inside the conductor. So the outer charge has to be arranged such that it cancels the field from the inner charge in the conductor's material.

Alternatively, perhaps the field outside can be considered as the sum of the field from the cavity's charge and the conductor's induced charges. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: think about the method of images. For a point charge inside a conducting sphere, the image charge is at a certain position. But in this case, the charge is inside a non-centered cavity. So maybe the image charge concept is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Gauss's law. Let me consider a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, at radius L. The total enclosed charge inside this surface would be the sum of the conductor's charges. The conductor's inner surface has -q, the outer has +q. So total is zero? Wait, no. Conductor was initially uncharged. Then, putting +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor becomes -q, and the outer surface becomes +q. So the total charge inside the Gaussian surface (the conductor) is (-q) + (+q) = 0? No, wait, the conductor's total charge is zero because it was uncharged. Because the inner surface is -q, the outer is +q. So the total inside the Gaussian surface (which encloses the conductor) is zero? That can't be right, because the conductor's own charge is zero, and the added charge is inside the cavity, which is part of the conductor's interior.

Wait, no. The conductor's material is neutral, but the cavity's charge is inside the conductor. So the conductor's total charge is still zero. But the Gaussian surface encloses the entire conductor, which includes the cavity. So the total charge enclosed would be the charge inside the cavity, which is +q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, but the cavity's charge is part of the system inside the conductor. Wait, that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, the conductor is a conducting shell, so the charge on the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface is +q. So the total charge inside the Gaussian surface (which is outside the conductor) would be zero, because the conductor itself has no net charge, and the cavity's charge is inside the conductor. Wait, no, the conductor is neutral, but the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is inside the conductor. So for a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the enclosed charge would be +q (from the cavity's charge) plus the conductor's own charge (which is zero). So the total enclosed charge would be +q. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor would be as if that +q were at the center of the conductor, according to Gauss's law.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the Gaussian surface at radius L would enclose all the charge, which is +q. So the field depends only on the total charge, and the distance L.

But wait, the options don't all have L squared. Looking back, the options are:

A) (l - s cosθ)^2 denominator.

B) L² denominator.

C) (l + s cosθ)^2.

D) l².

So according to my reasoning, the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but why are there other options involving l and s? Because the point P's position relative to the cavity's center is l, and the centers are separated by s, with angle theta.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge is +q, but the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center. But wait, the conductor's center is at a distance s from the cavity's. So the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, which is s away from the cavity's center. So the distance between P and the cavity's center is l, which is sqrt(L² + s² - 2 L s cos(theta)) due to the law of cosines. Wait, but the options have expressions with (l +/- s cos(theta)) squared.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation as the field due to the +q charge in the cavity. But because the conductor's outer surface is +q, the field outside is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. So E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the effect of the position of the cavity. The conductor's outer surface charge would be +q, but the image charge would be at the center of the conductor. So point P is outside, so it would see the field as if the charge is at the conductor's center, and the field would be 1/(4πε₀) q / L².

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but another possibility: since the cavity's charge is off-center, the induced charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces might create a dipole or other multipole moments that affect the electric field outside. But for a dipole, the field outside would decrease as 1/r³, but the options have 1/r². So perhaps the dominant term is still the monopole term, which is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L², making option B correct.

Yes, I think that's right. So the answer is option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor then has a charge of $+q$ to ensure the conductor remains neutral overall.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. The total charge enclosed is $+q$, as the conductor's inner surface has $-q$ and its outer surface has $+q$. The electric field outside a spherical conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor, regardless of the distribution of charges on the inner surface.

3. **Gauss's Law Application**:  
   Using Gauss's law, the electric field at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
   This result holds because the field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge and the distance from the center.

4. **Relevance of Other Options**:  
   - Option A involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the field outside the conductor does not depend on the position of the cavity relative to the conductor's center.  
   - Option C involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also incorrect for the same reason.  
   - Option D involves $l^2$, which incorrectly assumes the field depends on the distance from the cavity's center rather than the conductor's center.  

Thus, the correct answer is based on the monopole term from the total charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor, leading to the electric field formula in option B.

**Answer: B**
