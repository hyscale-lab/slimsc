Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. They've mentioned two types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different connectivity, like how propane and butane are different in structure. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangementsâ€”like enantiomers or diastereomers.

Now, the problem has two parts: part A and part B.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between adjacent atoms, leading to different structures. For example, keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes. So, which of these compounds can't undergo tautomerism?

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It's like a benzene ring with two ketone groups at the para positions. So, each ketone group can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone would have tautomerism because each of the two carbonyl groups can form enol tautomers. So benzoquinone can tautomerize.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions. So, each ketone group is next to another ketone. Wait, but each ketone is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So, can any of them undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism generally requires the presence of a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. Let me think about the structure. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would
