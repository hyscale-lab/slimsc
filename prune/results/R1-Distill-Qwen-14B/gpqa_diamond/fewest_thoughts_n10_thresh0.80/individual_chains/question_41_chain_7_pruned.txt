Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. Let me try to think through it.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. And the question is asking, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer. The options are given, but I need to figure out the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in physics, when dealing with relative velocities, especially with light, we have to consider special relativity. Because light's speed is a constant in all inertial frames, right? Oh wait, but wait—this is about the speed of light in the medium, not in a vacuum. So maybe it's a bit different.

The speed of light in a medium is generally v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. So in the glass, the speed is c/n. But in this case, the glass itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So we might need to apply a velocity addition formula here. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, I should double-check. Oh right, the relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity
