Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. 

The scenario is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for making this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound, so they're using EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. After sequencing, they found changes in the first exon. Which mutation would probably let them get rid of the compound.

Hmm. So I think the question is about which mutation would disrupt the gene function. But wait, I should think about how mutations affect gene expression. The gene codes for a protein—since the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the anti-nutritional compound is probably a protein product of this gene. If they can mutate the gene so that it's not functional, then the compound won't be made.

So, looking at the mutants, each has a change in the first exon. Exons are the coding regions, so mutations there can affect the protein structure.

Wait, what do these mutations look like? Let me line them up.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing to the wild type, the third nucleotide is T versus C. Let me see: the wild type starts ATGTTTCTCGC... So from position 4: T T C T C G C... in mutant 1, it's T C T A C G C... Wait, maybe I should compare each position.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to see what kind of mutations each is. Maybe they're point mutations. Let's see.

Wild type: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So the fourth position changes from T to C. Let me check: the wild type has TTT C T C G C T... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the differences.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for frameshift mutations or nonsense mutations. Because a frameshift could completely change the downstream amino acids, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The part after ATG is TTCTACGCTGGTA... So comparing to the wild type, in the first exon, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, maybe breaking it down into codons would help. Let's see the wild type:

The first few codons:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
