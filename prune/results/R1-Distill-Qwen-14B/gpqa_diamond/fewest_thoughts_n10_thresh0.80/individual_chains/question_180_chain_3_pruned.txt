Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. 

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm, minimum energy... I'm thinking about what factors contribute to the potential energy in a system of charges. I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy is the total potential energy of all the charges relative to each other.

Wait, but since we're looking for the minimum energy, I wonder if it's the potential energy when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes that energy. Or is it the potential energy of the system as given?

Wait no, the problem says 12 charges are constrained at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters away from the 13th charge which is at P.

So, the setup is that there's a central charge at P, and 12 charges arranged around it, each at 2 meters. But wait, the problem says 12 are constrained at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed there. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P.

So the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, potential energy for a system of charges is the sum over all pairs. So for each pair, we calculate the potential energy and add them all together.

Each charge has a charge of 2e. e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 C = 3.204e-1
