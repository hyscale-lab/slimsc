Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy maybe.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all sitting 2 meters away from P. Hmm. So I imagine the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged in a sphere or something around it, each at 2 meters from P.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges depends on how the charges are arranged. The potential energy is minimized when the charges are as close as possible, right? But in this case, 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters, so maybe that's the distance they can't get closer than. So the system's energy would be based on the potential between the fixed charge and the others, and the potential between each of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P. So the fixed charge is at P, which is 0 meters away from itself. So the fixed charge is at the center, and each of the 12 is 2 m away from it. So the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges—how is that calculated?

I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the fixed charge would be U = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2. Because each of the 12 charges is 2
