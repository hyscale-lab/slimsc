Okay, so I've got this question about absorption lines in the Milky Way, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that observations are made at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs. Wait, wait, that's really far away. I remember that a gigaparsec is like a billion parsecs, so that's a significant distance, probably looking into other galaxies or galaxy clusters. But wait, the question is about what's observed in the Milky Way with the absorption line energy equivalent of 3.9 microelectron volts.

Hmm, absorption lines are typically from electrons moving between energy levels in atoms or molecules, right? The energy of the line depends on the transition. So the energy given here is 3.9e-6 eV, which is a very small number. Let me think about the energy scales here.

Wait, I remember that the ionization energy of hydrogen is about 13.6 eV. So 3.9 microvolts is way, way less than that. So this isn't ionization. It must be a transition in a hydrogen atom, but maybe in a different state or under different conditions.

Wait, no, wait. 3.9e-6 eV is 0.0000039 eV. That's super small. Let me think about where that energy might come from. Oh! I think about the 21 cm line, which is a hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen. The energy for that is about 5.9e-
