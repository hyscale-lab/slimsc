Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and angular momentum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have a principal quantum number l=1, right? So each electron has l=1.

They're talking about the coupled angular momentum state being |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Oh, right, the notation. So l1 and l2 are 1 each. The total l is 2, and the m is -1.

But wait, when you couple two angular momenta, the possible total l values range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since l1 and l2 are 1, the possible l are 0,1,2. So l=2 is the maximum here. So that makes sense.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of these has eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, or +ħ because l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So for each electron, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or ħ.

Wait, but in this state |1,1,2,-1>, what does that tell us about the individual m1 and m2?

Hmm, because when you couple two angular momenta, the state is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 that add up to the total m. So the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

But the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, which is the coupled state with l=2 and m=-1. So if I want to find the possible m1 and m2, they have to sum to -1. The state |1,1,2,-1> would be a combination of all possible |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. But wait, no. Actually, the coupled state is a specific combination. For two spin-1 particles (in this case, orbital angular momentum), the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed in terms of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

But the question is about the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z being -ħ would mean m1 = -1, and same for m2.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think. Each electron's orbital angular momentum has m values of -1, 0, +1. So if we're measuring both L1z and L2z, and each can be -ħ, 0, or ħ, the possible outcomes for each are those values. The question is the joint probability that both are -ħ. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Their sum would be m1 + m2 = -2.

But the total m in the state is -1. So if m1 and m2 are both -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1. So this means that the state |1,1,2,-1> can't have any component where m1 and m2 are both -1 because that would require m_total to be -2, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the possible ways to get m_total = -1 from m1 and m2. Let me list all
