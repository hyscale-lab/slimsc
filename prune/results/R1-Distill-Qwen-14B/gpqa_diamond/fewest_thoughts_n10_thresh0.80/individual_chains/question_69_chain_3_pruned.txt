Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and bubble chambers. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution required in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy of the particle in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, wait. Proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation due to special relativity. Oh right, the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

But wait, the energy given is 27 GeV. That's the kinetic energy, I think. Or is it the total energy? Because in particle physics, energy can refer to either. Hmm, the problem says "energy in the Bubble Chamber" which is a bit ambiguous. Oh wait, when particles are moving in a lab frame, their total energy is the sum of rest mass and kinetic energy. But for high-energy particles, the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, so maybe in this case, the energy refers to the total energy. But just to be safe, I should confirm.

The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV, so m = 3.41 GeV/c². The total energy E is given as 27 GeV. So gamma would be E / (m c²). Since E is already in GeV and m is in GeV/c², we can write gamma as E/(m) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... 3.41 goes into 27 about 7.9 times, because 3.41 *7 is 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So approximately 7.9.

Wait, actually, 3.41 * 7.9 = let
