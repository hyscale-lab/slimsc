Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices. Hmm, density matrices, right. I remember they're used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But I'm a bit rusty on the details, so let me think.

The question gives a specific density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in qubit space from the options given.

Wait, what's a qubit space? Oh right, qubits can be represented in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. So the state is a vector in this space. But wait, this rho is a density matrix, not a state vector. So maybe the question is referring to the Bloch sphere representation? I think that's where mixed states are mapped.

The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. For pure states, it's a point on the unit sphere. But for mixed states, like this rho, it's somewhere inside the sphere. The position is determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, I think. The formula is something like r = (x, y, z), where each component is the expectation value of sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z respectively.

Wait, how do you calculate that from a density matrix? The expectation value of an operator O is Tr(O rho). So for each Pauli matrix sigma_i, I compute Tr(sigma_i rho) to get the component.

Let me write down the given rho. Rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each component.

First, the Pauli matrices: sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So let's compute Tr(sigma_i rho) for each i.

Wait, what is |0> and |1> in matrix form? |0> is [1; 0], |1> is [0;1]. So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So rho would be (1/2)( [[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]] ) = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

So rho is the matrix [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Now compute Tr(rho sigma_x). Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Multiply rho and sigma_x:

rho * sigma_x = (0.5 * [[0,1],[1,0]]) * [[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]] * (0.5) ?

Wait, maybe I should compute the product as matrices. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the trace directly.

The trace of sigma_x * rho is the sum of the diagonal elements of sigma_x * rho.

Wait, let me compute sigma_x * rho:

sigma_x * rho = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]] 

Multiplying element-wise:

First row: (0*0.5 + 1*0) , (0*0 +1*0.5) → (0, 0.5)
Second row: (1*0.5 +0*0), (1*0 +0*0.5) → (0.5, 0)
So sigma_x * rho is [[0, 0.5], [0.5, 0]]
The trace is 0 + 0 = 0. So Tr(sigma_x rho) is 0.

Hmm, so the x-component is zero.

Now sigma_y * rho. Let's compute sigma_y * rho.

Sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Multiply by rho: [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]

So:

First element (1,1): 0*0.5 + (-i)*0 = 0
(1,2): 0*0 + (-i)*0.5 = -i *0.5
(2,1): i*0.5 +0*0 = i*0.5
(2,2): i*0 +0*0.5 = 0
So sigma_y * rho is [[0, -i*0.5], [i*0.5, 0]]

The trace is 0+0 =0. So Tr(sigma_y rho) is 0.

Hmm, that's zero too.

Then sigma_z * rho:

sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Multiply by rho:

First row: 1*0.5 + 0*0 =0.5; 1*0 +0*0.5=0
Second row: 0*0.5 + (-1)*0=0; 0*0 + (-1)*0.5= -0.5
So sigma_z * rho = [[0.5, 0], [0, -0.5]]
The trace is 0.5 + (-0.5) =0? Wait, no, wait, trace is sum of diagonals, which is 0.5 + (-0.5) =0. So Tr(sigma_z rho) is 0.

Wait a minute, all three components are zero. So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0).

But wait, wait. What about the overall state? Rho is a completely mixed state because it's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That should correspond to the completely mixed state, which in the Bloch sphere is the origin, because there's no coherence and the state is equally likely to be |0> or |1>.

Yes, that makes sense. The Bloch vector would be all zeros because there's no bias in any direction. So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\), respectively. These are calculated as \(x = \text{Tr}(\sigma_x \rho)\), \(y = \text{Tr}(\sigma_y \rho)\), and \(z = \text{Tr}(\sigma_z \rho)\).

The given \(\rho\) is explicitly:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(x = \text{Tr}(\sigma_x \rho)\)
The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). Multiplying \(\sigma_x\) and \(\rho\):

\[
\sigma_x \rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The trace of this matrix is \(0 + 0 = 0\), so \(x = 0\).

### Step 2: Compute \(y = \text{Tr}(\sigma_y \rho)\)
The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). Multiplying \(\sigma_y\) and \(\rho\):

\[
\sigma_y \rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The trace of this matrix is \(0 + 0 = 0\), so \(y = 0\).

### Step 3: Compute \(z = \text{Tr}(\sigma_z \rho)\)
The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\). Multiplying \(\sigma_z\) and \(\rho\):

\[
\sigma_z \rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The trace of this matrix is \(1/2 + (-1/2) = 0\), so \(z = 0\).

### Conclusion
The Bloch vector corresponding to \(\rho\) is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which represents the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This matches option **C**.
