Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see what it's about.

The problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in a tube moving along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, none of the particles are found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only in the region between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So to find the normalization constant 'a', I need to integrate the square of the wave function's modulus over all space where the particle exists. Since the particle is not found outside x=1 to x=3, the integral should be from 1 to 3.

Wait, but wait—the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. Because modulus squared of a complex number (c + di) is c² + d².

So let me write that out. The wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared |ψ|² is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait no, wait. That's only if the wave function is ψ = A + Bi, with A and B real. Then |ψ|² is A² + B². So in this case, yes, that's correct.

So then the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ|² dx should equal 1, because the total probability must be 1.

So the integral becomes ∫(from 1 to 3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral in parts. It's the sum of two integrals:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral: ∫ a²/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So that becomes a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] because when x=1, 1+x=2, and when x=3, 1+x=4. So ln(4/2)=ln(2), so a² ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

Adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

I know that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.720. Taking the square root, a is sqrt(0.720) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because I've seen some problems where normalization requires the integral of |ψ|² dx =1. But in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But wait, could the wave function have a time dependence or something else?

No, the problem states that the wave function is described as such in the region x between 1 and 3. So I think the approach is correct.

Wait another thing: The wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we calculate the modulus squared, it's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Yes, that's right. So integrating that from 1 to 3 should give 1.

So the calculation goes:

Integral [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Which is a² * ln( (1+3)/(1+1) ) + 0.25*(3-1) = a² ln(4/2) + 0.5 = a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a²= (1-0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5/(0.6931) ≈0.720, a≈0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5
\]

Adding these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.720
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.720} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), corresponding to **Option B**.

Answer: B
