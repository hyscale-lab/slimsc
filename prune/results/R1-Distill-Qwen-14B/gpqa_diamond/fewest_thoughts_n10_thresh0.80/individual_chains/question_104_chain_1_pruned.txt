Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity, right. I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit, and we can measure that shift to figure out stuff about the planet.

The question says there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, same mass, same everything else.

Now, the data given is about the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, P2/P1. But how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period?

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula I remember is K = (v) where v is the velocity of the star. The exact formula might involve the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Let me think about it.

I recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P * (2π)^(1/3)) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Another approach: the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass (Neptune is much lighter than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( c^(1/3) * (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a more simplified version. Alternatively, since the stars are identical (same mass), and the planets' masses are similar, but the shifts are different.

Wait, the problem states that the planets have masses similar to Neptune. So, M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So, M_p1 sin i1 ≈ M_p2 sin i2. But since both are around different stars, but the stars' masses are the same, but the inclination angles might be different. Wait, but the question doesn't mention the inclination, so perhaps we can assume that sin i is the same for both? Or maybe it's not given, so we might have to ignore it, or assume it's the same? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the formula can be written as K proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3))) )

Wait, let's think about this. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and if the orbits are circular, e is zero, so sqrt(1 - e^2) is 1. So, K ≈ (constant) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this problem, M_p1 ≈ M_p2, because both are Neptune
