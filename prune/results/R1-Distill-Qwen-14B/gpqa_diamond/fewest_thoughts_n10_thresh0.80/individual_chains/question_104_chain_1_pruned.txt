Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. 

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, which probably means the orbits are stable and not eccentric. 

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the star's velocity. The formula for K is something like K = (v*sin i) / (1 + (M_planet/M_star))^(1/3), but since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, we can approximate it as K ≈ (v sin i) * (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star))^(something). Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude more carefully. 

The formula for K is K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)) )^(1/3) ). Hmm, wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between K, the orbital period, and the other parameters. 

Alternatively, since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, maybe the ratio of their velocities can be connected to the ratio of their orbital periods. 

Wait, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, but that's when other factors are held constant. Let's think about the formula again. 

The radial velocity semi-amplitude formula is K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 day^2 * (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) ] * something... Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * c) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the dependency. Since both planets have similar masses and their stars have the same mass, M_planet and M_star are the same for both. So the ratio of K1 to K2 would be proportional to (P2/P1)^(-1/3) because K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3) or something like that.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

Assuming that M_p << M_*, which is the case here because Neptune's mass is much smaller than the Sun's, the denominator becomes approximately M_*^(2/3). So K ≈ ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / M_*^(2/3) )

Since both stars have the same mass M_* and both planets have similar M_p, the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ P^(-1/3).

So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7. But since K ∝ P^(-1/3), then (5/7) = P2^(-1/3) / P1^(-1/3) ) = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3).

Wait, let me write that as:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3) )

Because K ∝ P^(-1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1) ^ (-1/3) )

So rearranging:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3 ) => 

Take both sides to the power of -3:

(K1/K2)^(-3) = (P2/P1 )

So (K2/K1)^3 = P2/P1 )

Wait, wait. Let's see. Let me go through the steps again.

K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3) because K = [ G/(c) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p) / (M_*)^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

So K ∝ (1/P)^(1/3) )

Thus, K1 ∝ 1/P1^(1/3)
K2 ∝ 1/P2^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Let me think of it as K1 = A * (1/P1)^(1/3)
K2 = A * (1/P2)^(1/3)
where A is some constant depending on G, c, M_p, M_*, etc.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

But in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is7. So K1 is smaller than K2.

So K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

We need to find how many times longer P2 is than P1, so (P2/P1) = ?

Let me compute (5/7) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So P2 is 0.36
