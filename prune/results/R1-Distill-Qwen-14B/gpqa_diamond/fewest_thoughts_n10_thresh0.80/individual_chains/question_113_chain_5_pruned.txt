Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopy data. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I need to analyze the given data to see which formula fits.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Oh right, broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. The very broad one might suggest it's an -OH stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a phenol. Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Wait, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. What about 1650? That could be an aromatic ring, maybe a C=C stretch or another carbonyl. Or wait, sometimes conjugated carbonyls or maybe an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not amide. Maybe an ester or something with conjugated groups.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically in alkenes, so the compound has a double bond. So the structure probably has a C=C somewhere.

Mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let me think about that. 45 could correspond to certain functional groups. For example, CH3CO+ is 45 (since CH3 is 15, CO is 29, 15+29=44? Wait, 45 maybe is CH3COO-? Or wait, maybe a fragment like (CH2O) something. Or perhaps it's a ketone group losing something. Hmm, I'm not as confident about this part.

Let me look at the options:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The degrees of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, which the options don't have.

For option A: C=6, H=12, O=2. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So degree of unsaturation is 1. But wait, that would suggest either one ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. If the degree is 1, maybe a ring and a double bond? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Option B: C6H10O. (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees, which could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees of unsaturation. Could be a double bond and a ring, or two rings, or maybe two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O. (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So same as option A, one degree: a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So option A and D have only one degree, but the presence of a double bond suggests that they might have another unsaturation, but wait, I might have miscalculated.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Formula is C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. That could be one ring or one double bond. But the problem says NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond. So if it's a double bond, that uses up the one degree. But what else could the compound have? Let's see. Maybe an ester group, which has a carbonyl and an ether oxygen.

Option B: C6H10O. So (14-10)/2=2. Two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. The vinyl H suggests a double bond, so one of the two degrees is from that. The other could be a ring.

Option C: C6H10O2. (14 -10)/2=2. So that's two degrees. Could be a double bond and an ester group (which has a carbonyl), or maybe two rings. Or perhaps an aromatic ring, which is three degrees, but that's not possible here because 2 is only two. Wait, no, aromatic rings contribute as one degree per ring, but benzene is three degrees since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So maybe a benzene ring would have three degrees, which is more than our options.

Wait, but if it's a benzene ring, that's three degrees, but our options have only two. So maybe the compound doesn't have a benzene ring. So perhaps the two degrees come from an ester group (which has a carbonyl, one double bond) and another double bond, like vinyl.

Option D: C6H12O. (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree. So either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl, so that's a double bond. So that would account for the one degree. So perhaps a cyclic ether with a double bond? Or an alcohol with a double bond. But not sure.

Now, the FTIR: the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O). 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretch) or another carbonyl group, perhaps conjugated. Alternatively, maybe an ester group, which has a carbonyl, but the 1650 might be an adjacent group.

Wait, esters usually have a carbonyl around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. If the other peak is at 1650, maybe that's an aromatic ring (like if there's a benzene ring), but I thought earlier that might not fit because the degrees wouldn't add up. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a conjugated double bond, so the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the C=C might be around 1650.

So if the compound has a conjugated ester group, that would have the two carbonyl peaks? Wait, no. An ester has one carbonyl. Wait, wait a second. Maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl, and 1650 is another functional group. Like maybe an aromatic ring, but again, unsure.

Looking back, the 1H NMR has vinyl protons, so definitely a double bond, making the structure have a double bond. The presence of ester groups (if that's what the IR is suggesting) would mean O is present in the formula.

The mass spectrum has a peak at m/z 45. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, 45 could be a fragment that's CH3COO- (which is 45?), wait, the molecular weight of CH3COO- (that's 45: 12 + 1*3 + 12 +16*2) wait, wait: CH3COO⁻ would be 45? Let's calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. CH3COO- is C2H3O2⁻. So (2*12) + (3*1) + (16*2) =24 +3 +32=59? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm confusing the ion. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (
