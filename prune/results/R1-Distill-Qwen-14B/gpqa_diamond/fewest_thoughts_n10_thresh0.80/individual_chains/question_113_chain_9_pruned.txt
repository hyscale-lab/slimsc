Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to match the spectral data to the correct formula.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm⁻¹. A broad peak around 3000 suggests the presence of either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (but since none of the options have nitrogen, it's probably O-H). The peaks at 1700 and 1650: 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C in conjugation). Wait, but 1650 is more like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide, but again, no nitrogen in the options. So perhaps it's an ester or a ketone with another group.

The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. That suggests the structure has a double bond, maybe part of an ester or another functional group.

Now, looking at the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z=45. What fragments have a mass of 45? Well, 45 is the molar mass of CH3O (which is 15 + 32 = 45?), wait, wait. Let me think. Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So C2H5O would be (12*2)+(5)+(16)=24+5+16=45. Hmm, but that's more like a fragment from an ester. Alternatively, maybe CH3CO+ (acetate ion) is 43? Wait, no, wait: CH3CO is C2H3O2, which is 2*12 +3 + 16*2=24+3+32=59. Hmm, that's not right. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH2=CH-O- (but that's maybe not right), or perhaps a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of something else. Wait, another approach: the molecular ion minus some group equals 45.

Wait, let's think of the possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments. Let me look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) =72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. MW is (6*12)+(10)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW: 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=104? Wait, wait: 6*12 is 72, 10 H is 10, O2 is 32. So 72+10=82+32=114. Wait, no, 72+10 is 82, plus 32 is 114. So molecular ion would be 114.

Option D: C6H12O. MW is 6*12=72 +12=84 +16=96 +12? Wait, let me recalculate. 6*12=72, 12 H is 12, O is 16. So 72+12=84 +16=100. So molecular weight is 100.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. If the molecular ion is, say, 114 (option C), then a fragment of 45 could come from losing 69 (114-45=69). But what would that mean? Alternatively, if the molecular ion is 116 (option A), then losing 71 would give 45. Hmm, maybe I should think of common fragments. 

Wait, another approach: in mass spectrometry, the most common fragments are the McLafferty rearrangement, or loss of water, or other common groups. For example, if the compound is an ester, like methyl something, then the loss of the methyl group would give a fragment. Wait, methyl has a mass of 15. So if you have an ester, the R-O-CO-O-R' kind of structure (wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R')).

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the result of cleavage. Let me think about the possible structures. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, the compound probably has an alkene. An ester would have a carbonyl group. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond.

If it's an ester, the structure could be something like CH2CH2COO-something. Wait, but let's think of the molecular formula. Let's take option C: C6H10O2. The formula is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is CnHmOx. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - 2x)/2. Hmm, for C6H10O2: n=6, m=10, x=2.

So (2*6 +2 -10 -2*2)/2 = (14-10-4)/2=0/2=0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: 2n +2 - m - 2x. So 2*6=12+2=14 -10=4 - 4=0. So 0 degrees. Wait, that's impossible because the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens (so a double bond, which is a degree of unsaturation). So perhaps I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But in this case, X and N are zero. So for C6H10O2: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2 degrees of unsaturation. So two degrees: could be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, or two rings, etc. But since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. Maybe an ester group and a double bond. 

So, for the structure, perhaps an ester with a double bond, like methyl vinyl something. Wait, but how does that fit with the options? Let's think.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a double bond or a ring. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (14 -10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: 2. So two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or one ring.

Wait, so the fact that the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So all options except D have at least one double bond. Let's think about the IR peaks. The 1700 is a carbonyl. So maybe ester or ketone. The 1650 could be conjugated with the carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe an ester with a conjugated double bond, which would explain both the carbonyl and the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak.

So the structure might be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So that would have both a carbonyl and a double bond. 

Now, looking at the mass spec, the fragment at 45. Let's think about what would fragment to give 45. If the molecule breaks in such a way that a 45 mass fragment is formed, perhaps the loss of a larger group. Alternatively, the fragment itself is a small group.

Wait, 45 is the mass of CH3CO+ (which is 43? Let me calculate: C=12, H3=3, O=16. 12+3+16=31. No, that's 31. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's the fragment like (CH2)2O or something. Wait, (CH2)2O is 48? No, 2*(14) +16=44. Not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a group like CH2CH2O, but that's more than 45. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Like, the loss of an ester group. Wait, perhaps the ester group is (CH2)COO-, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of common fragments. Another approach: the molecular ion is likely to be the molecular weight of the compound. So, for each option, what's the molecular weight, and can a fragment of 45 come from that?

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight: 6*12=72 +12=84 +32=116. So 116. So a fragment of 45 could be from losing 71, which seems less likely. But perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 and 71. Wait, but 71 is a possible mass (like C5H11? No, 71 is more like C3H7O something... Not sure.)

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10=82 +16=98. So a fragment of 45 would come from losing 53. 53 is the mass of something like C3H7 (3*12 +7=43?), no. Wait, 53 is maybe C3H5O? Not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=114. So fragment at 45 would mean losing 69. 69 is possible, like C3H9O or something. Not sure, but maybe.

Option D: C6H12O. Molecular weight is 6*12=72 +12=84 +16=100.
