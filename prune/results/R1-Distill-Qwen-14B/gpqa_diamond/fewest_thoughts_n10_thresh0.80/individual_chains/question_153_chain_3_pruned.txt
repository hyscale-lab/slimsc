Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta position, forming an enolate intermediate. 

Looking at the question, there are three reactions labeled (A), (B), and (C), and I need to figure out their products based on the reactants provided. The options give different possibilities for each product.

Let's start with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I think dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate, and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor. In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor.

Wait, dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups on the central carbon, right? So when it donates the enolate, it adds to the acrylate. The acrylate has a substituent at the beta position (the p-tolyl group). The reaction should form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the acrylate's beta carbon.

So the product would be a longer chain. The structure would be something like the p-tolyl group attached to a new carbon that's connected to the malonate part. Since malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-, when it adds, the central carbon (which was the alpha to both carbonyls) would attach to the methyl group from the acrylate. Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CH-COOMe. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: so the structure is CH2-CO-O-Me with a p-tolyl group on the other end of the double bond. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl on carbon 3.

Wait, actually, the structure is CH2CH2 with substituents. Let me think: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon of the acrylate. Wait, wait, no, in acrylate, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the double bond is between 1 and 2. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon, which can't be, because the acrylate is only three carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong.
