Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing specific amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, so I think this has to do with the dissociation of phosphoric acid.

Wait, so the problem gives me the masses of both compounds and the volume of the solution. I guess the first thing I need to do is calculate the concentrations of each salt in the solution. Then, maybe I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or some kind of equilibrium approach because we have a buffer solution here.

Let me jot down the given data. The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The masses are both 1.00 g each. The molar masses are 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. Oh right, the Ksp values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. 

So, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, right? Its formula is K(H2PO4). So when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, but wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So in solution, it's 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water of crystallization, but that probably doesn't affect the concentration much.

Wait, so I think these two salts form a buffer solution because H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are conjugate acid-base pairs. The pKa's are relevant here. Let me think about the pKa values. Since Ka1 is 7.5e-3, pKa1 would be log(1/(7.5e-3)) which is about 2.12 (since log(7.5)=0.875, so 3-0.875=2.125). Similarly, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is about 7.207. Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is around 11.74.

In a buffer solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, which pKa are we using? Since H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is about 7.207.

So, the buffer here consists of H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the base). So I need to find their concentrations in solution.

First, let me calculate the moles of each.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007343 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005605 mol.

So in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.0
