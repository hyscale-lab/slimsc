Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It also talks about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, let me break it down.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is figuring out which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is determining which of two compounds shows optical isomerism: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate.

I'll tackle part A first. What's tautomerism? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between two structural isomers, usually through the movement of a hydrogen atom and a simultaneous change in the position of double bonds. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group and an enol form interconvert.

So, the compounds in question are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups at para positions, right? So it's O=C6H4=O. Or wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups opposite each other. Does it have any possibility for tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires adjacent atoms that can shift, like a carbonyl next to an -OH or NH group. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls but no adjacent hydrogens that can shift. Wait, but wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups but in a conjugated system. Maybe it's a dienone or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about whether the compound has any acidic hydrogens that can lose a proton and form a double bond.

Wait, benzoquinone can exist in keto forms, but does it have any possibility for enol tautomerism? I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it can't because the positions are such that the hydrogen isn't available. Or perhaps benzoquinone is more rigid.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, each at positions 1,3,5. So, it's a symmetrical structure with three carbonyls. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? Let me think. Each carbonyl is in position where if a hydrogen were adjacent, it could shift. But wait, all three are on the ring. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic triketone, and each ketone is at alternate positions. So each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group? Or wait, the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C- in a ring.

Wait, let's imagine it. Each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. So, between each O=C is a CH2 group. So, the structure is (O=C-CH2-O=C-CH2-O=C-) linked in a ring, but that's not possible because each position is single-bonded. Wait, maybe each ketone is attached to the ring with each carbon connected to two others. So, each of the three carbons in the ring has a carbonyl group. So, structure is like O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C in a six-membered ring. So, each carbonyl is at every other carbon.

In such a structure, would tautomerism be possible? I'm trying to think about the possibility of enol tautomerism. But with three ketones, maybe not. Because each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, which isn't acidic enough or doesn't have a hydrogen adjacent for enol formation. Or wait, maybe each CH2 is between two carbonyls, making the H's alpha to two carbonyls, which are more acidic. But for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen that can be lost to form a double bond.

Wait, but if each CH2 is flanked by two carbonyls, would they have alpha hydrogens? Wait, in a cyclohexane ring where each carbonyl is in 1,3,5 positions, each of the carbons between them (like position 2, 4, 6) is a CH2 group. So each of these CH2 has two H's attached. But for enol tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl. So each of these CH2 groups has H's that are alpha to two carbonyls, but can they form an enol?

Wait, for a hydrogen to be involved in tautomerism, it must be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So in this case, each CH2 is between two carbonyls, so each H on CH2 is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So, could that lead to the possibility of tautomerism?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the ring is fully conjugated, making it more rigid and unable to undergo such shifts. Or maybe the molecule doesn't have the necessary hydrogens in the right positions for tautomerism.

Wait, another thought: tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds. For that, you need a hydrogen that is beta to a carbonyl group, perhaps. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Benzoquinone is a dienone, right? It has two carbonyl groups. Can it undergo any kind of tautomerism? I think benzoquinone can exist in keto and enol forms, but wait, enol form would require an adjacent hydrogen. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring, so each is para to the other. The ring is fully conjugated. So, the carbonyl groups are in positions where they are conjugated with the aromatic ring. I don't think there are any hydrogens directly adjacent to the carbonyl groups because the ring's structure is such that the carbonyl is at each position, and the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. So perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, which are necessary for enol tautomerism.

Wait, wait, in benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O, but actually, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. But in benzene, each carbon is bonded to another and has a double bond. So, the carbons adjacent to the ketones are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have any H's attached because in benzene, each carbon has only one H (if it's para substituted). Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups at the para positions. So the structure is:

O=C–C6H3–C=O

Wait, but in reality, the benzene ring has two adjacent carbons with the ketones? No, benzoquinone is usually 1,4-benzoquinone, so the two ketone groups are para to each other. So the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but the ring has four CH groups. Wait, no, each substituent is a carbonyl. So in the benzene ring, the two carbons with the carbonyl groups are each bonded to two adjacent carbons that are part of the ring. Each of those adjacent carbons would be CH groups, but they don't have any Hs attached because in the benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to one substituent (the carbonyl) and two others in the ring, and possibly a hydrogen if it's a mono-substituted benzene. Wait, no, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, so the adjacent carbons are each CH groups.

Wait, maybe I'm getting too confused. Let me think about tautomerism again. For a compound to show tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen that's alpha to a carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon which is part of the aromatic ring. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring, which doesn't have Hs attached because the ring is fully conjugated. So, benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the carbonyl groups are attached directly to the ring, which doesn't have Hs on those adjacent carbons. Therefore, benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism. 

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups on the ring. The carbons between them are CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two H's, which are alpha to two carbonyl groups. So, which one is more acidic? Since each H is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, they might be more acidic and more susceptible to deprotonation, leading to enol tautomerism.

Wait, so if the CH2 groups have H's that are alpha to two carbonyls, they can lose a proton and form a double bond, leading to tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism, and benzoquinone would not. Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So for part A, A is benzoquinone. So looking at the options, in option B and D, A is benzoquinone. So which of these is correct?

Wait, let me think again. If benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, then it can't undergo tautomerism. So part A would have A = benzoquinone. So options B and D are candidates.

Now, moving on to part B. The question is: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism?

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, i.e., a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it can also occur in other situations, like allene-type compounds or certain rings, but the main thing is chirality.

First, let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)CH(OH)CH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Its ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of propanoic acid. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the 2-hydroxy would be CH2(COOH)CH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the 2 position is the middle CH2. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, that would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the CH3 group),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (the ester group),
- and the other CH2? Wait, wait, the structure is CH3–CH(OH)–COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is connected to:

Left: CH3,
Right: COOCH3,
OH,
and the CH2? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, so the central CH has:

- CH3 (from CH3-),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon (from CH-) which is the COOCH3 end. Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is part of the same chain. Let me draw this out.

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central CH has:

- One CH3,
- One OH,
- One COOCH3,
- And the other side is a CH2 group leading to the COOCH3? No, wait, the structure is more accurately:

Carbon chain: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (C2) is bonded to:

- CH3 (C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (C3),
- and the other bond is to C3, which is the carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The ester is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central CH (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (C3),
- and the other bond is to the adjacent carbon (C3?), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon (C3) which is a carbonyl group.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to number the carbons.

Propanoate ester: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central carbon (C2):

- It's attached to:

   a) CH3 (C1),
   b) OH,
   c) COOCH3 (C3),
   d) and the other bond is attached to C3, but wait, no. The C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (COOCH3), OH, and the adjacent H? Wait, no. Wait, each carbon must have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

C1: CH3-
C2: CH(OH)-
C3: COOCH3.

So, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (COOCH3), OH, and another H. Because it's a CH group. So in this case, the C2 has:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a H.

Wait, no, that can't be right because CH would have only three bonds. Wait, no, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (C2) is CH. So:

- C1: CH3,
- C2: CH(OH)-,
- C3: COOCH3.

So, the C2 has:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would mean it's a CH group, but that can't be right because that would imply C2 has only three bonds. Oh wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure as:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central CH is attached to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (right),
- and one hydrogen.

Wait, no, that would make it a CH2? Because if the central carbon is CH, then it must have four bonds. Oh wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)-(CH(OH))- (COOCH3).

But the middle CH(OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the adjacent carbon (from COOCH3). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, where the CH(OH) is connected to the CH3 on one side and the COOCH3 on the other. So the central carbon (C2) has:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2? No, wait.

I think I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the presence of a chiral center is more straightforward. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups attached.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another carbon (the C3 from COOCH3). Wait, no. Let me think again.

The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
      |
CH3-CH(OH)-

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Another approach: the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

1. CH3,
2. OH,
3. COOCH3,
4. and another CH group? No, I'm not getting this right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that C2 is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and a CH2 group? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the same as (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different way. Let me imagine the structure:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another H.

Wait, that makes four bonds:

- CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, four different groups? No, because the H is a single bond. Wait, no, if it's a CH(OH), that implies that the central carbon has two CH groups. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the central carbon has four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another H.

Wait, no, because if it's a CH(OH), then perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. But if it's asymmetrical, it could have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: considering the structure, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH2? Or perhaps another CH3?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible stereoisomerism. If the molecule has a chiral center, it will have optical isomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on C2 are arranged symmetrically, then no chiral center exists.

Wait, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, C2 is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH? I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to look for another approach.

Now, let's consider dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)CH(COOCH3)COOH, wait no. Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer, right? Wait, maleic acid is the cis diacid, and fumaric acid is the trans. Wait, no, maleic acid is trans, fumaric acid is cis? Or is it the other way around. Wait, no, maleic acid is cis, and fumaric acid is trans? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid has the two carboxylic acid groups on adjacent carbons in a cis configuration, while fumaric acid is the trans form. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, fumarate is the trans di-ester. So dimethyl fumarate would be the trans di-ester of maleic acid.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)
But no, wait, it's more accurate to say that the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration. Wait, but in reality, dimethyl fumarate has the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the two COOCH3 groups are trans to each other across the double bond.

In any case, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that it has a double bond with two ester groups on either end, in a trans configuration.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Or is it planar? For a molecule to have optical isomers, it needs to have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is a trans di-ester with a double bond. The structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But arranged trans. So each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, each of the double bond carbons is attached to one COOCH3 and one CH2 or something else?

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in a trans configuration. So each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two different groups. Let me think. If the structure is (COOCH3)C=C(COOCH3), with each carbon in the double bond attached to two COOCH3 groups, then each of these carbons is connected to two identical groups (COOCH3), a double bond, and possibly two more substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The central part is a double bond between two carbons, each attached to a COOCH3 group. So each of these carbons is bonded to:

- Two COOCH3 groups,
- One double bond (shared with the other carbon),
- And perhaps a hydrogen or another substituent.

Wait, no. Let me get the correct structure. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of maleic acid is HO2CCHCH2CO2H, but in the cis configuration. When esterified, it becomes dimethyl fumarate as (CH2(COOCH3))2 with the double bond in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration, meaning the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, is the molecule symmetrical?

If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have optical isomers. But if it's asymmetrical, it might.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. So, for dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans di-ester, does it have a plane of symmetry?

If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule is planar and symmetrical. Because if you flip the molecule over, it would look the same. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and thus won't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the groups are arranged symmetrically, then it's a meso compound and not chiral. For example, tartaric acid has a meso form which is achiral despite having stereogenic centers.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is a di-ester with two identical substituents (COOCH3) on each double bond carbon, and the arrangement is trans.

So, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two substituents (maybe H or another group). Wait, no, the structure is more accurately:

The molecule is (Z)- or (E)-configured. Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is in the trans configuration. So the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

But arranged trans. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2COOCH3)2C=C.

No, perhaps I should find a better way. Let me think about the possibility of a chiral center in each compound.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: If the central carbon (C2) is connected to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. So let's see:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and the fourth group is a hydrogen.

Wait, if the central carbon is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H, then all four substituents are different. Therefore, it's a chiral center, so the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it's not a chiral center.

Wait, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the central carbon (C2) is connected to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2 group, that's four different groups, making it a chiral center.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me consider the structure from another angle. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) has:

- One CH3,
- One OH,
- One COOCH3,
- And one CH2 (from the COOCH3 side)? No, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the C2 has:

- CH3 (from left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from right),
- and another H.

If that's the case, then the four substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. All four are different, so C2 is a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate: the molecule has a double bond, and each substituent is a COOCH3 group. So each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3), meaning no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, is there a possibility of another chiral center elsewhere in the molecule? For example, if the ester groups have any chiral centers. But in dimethyl fumarate, both ester groups are on the same side (trans) of the double bond, but each is attached to the same substituents. So no, the molecule is symmetric and doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, but this seems conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me double-check.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH group. Wait, no, that makes four different substituents. So, yes, it's a chiral center, so the molecule has optical isomers.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

Arranged trans. Each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, so each of these carbons is connected to two identical substituents. Thus, no chiral centers. So dimethyl fumarate is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought that for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. But in this case, the dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it's achiral.

So, part B is asking which compound shows optical isomerism. So between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, the former has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism. The latter doesn't have any chiral centers and is symmetrical, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So looking back at the options:

Option B says A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Which matches what I thought. Option D says A is benzoquinone and B is dimethyl fumarate. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, so option D's B is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism, so the correct B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the correct option is B or D? Let me recheck.

Looking back, part A is which one doesn't show tautomerism. I thought benzoquinone doesn't, so A = benzoquinone. Part B is which shows optical isomerism: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does, so B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So looking at the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → correct.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate → B is wrong.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Could dimethyl fumarate have geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism? Because the question is about optical isomerism. So, even if a molecule has geometric isomerism, it doesn't mean it has optical activity.

So, dimethyl fumarate is a trans di-ester, but it's not chiral, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, looking at the options, the only one where A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is option B.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the given question.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between two structural isomers through the movement of a hydrogen atom and a simultaneous change in the position of double bonds. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound consists of a benzene ring with two ketone groups at the para positions. The carbons adjacent to the ketones are part of the aromatic ring, which does not have hydrogens that can participate in tautomerism. Since there are no alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups, benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, with CH₂ groups between them. The hydrogens on these CH₂ groups are alpha to two carbonyl groups, making them acidic and capable of participating in tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, i.e., a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to:
   - CH₃ (from CH₃-),
   - OH,
   - COOCH₃ (from COOCH₃),
   - and a hydrogen atom.  
   Since all four groups are different, C2 is a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the trans di-ester of maleic acid, with the structure:
   ```
   COOCH₃
        \
         C=C
        /
   COOCH₃
   ```
   Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical COOCH₃ groups. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism),
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
