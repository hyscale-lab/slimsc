Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated by (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Oh right, because X (halogens) isn't mentioned, so I think it's zero. So (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds, maybe.

The NMR data is given as:
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let me think about the possible structure. The peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 could be from aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Because the two doublets (d) with 2H each might correspond to two doublets, which is typical for para substituents. Like, for example, a benzene ring where each substituent has two protons as a doublet. So maybe each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the neighboring protons to split into doublets.

Wait, but looking at the shifts: 6.98 is downfield, which could be deshielded protons, maybe next to an electron-withdrawing group like a nitro group or a carbonyl. But the given molecular formula is C8H9NO, so one N and one O. So maybe an aromatic ring with a substituent that includes an oxygen.

Wait, the NMR peak at 9.72 is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. So what gives a triplet around 9.72? Maybe an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But an aldehyde would be a singlet, right? Unless it's coupled to another proton. Wait, wait, maybe it's an enol or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenol. But phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm, so that's not it. Or maybe it's a ketone or an amide. Hmm, not sure. 

Looking at the 3.66 ppm peak as a doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to an electrone
