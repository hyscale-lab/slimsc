Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The compound's molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=(10)/2=5. So five degrees: probably a benzene ring (3 double bonds) plus a double bond or a ring. Or maybe a ring and some double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet might mean coupling with two adjacent protons.
- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. Maybe aromatic protons in an ortho or para position, or perhaps part of another structure.
- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Maybe para to something else.
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Maybe some vinyl protons or maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol or something with OH groups. But wait, the broad singlet could be from an -OH group, but it's 2H, so not sure.
- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. Probably a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. Maybe part of an ether or an aldehyde's adjacent group.

Putting this together: The aldehyde proton at 9.72 suggests the molecule has an aldehyde group. Then, looking at the aromatic signals, 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two different benzene rings. Wait, but molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think: two benzene rings would take up 6 carbons (each benzene is 6 carbons), so the rest is 2 carbons plus the N and O. So perhaps two benzene rings attached to a three-carbon chain with an aldehyde group and an oxygen somewhere.

Wait, another way: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene is C6H6. So subtracting C6H6, we get C2H3NO. Hmm, what could that be? Maybe an ethyl group with a functional group. Wait, but here we have a total of 8 carbons. So perhaps the structure is something like two benzene rings attached via a chain that includes an aldehyde and an oxygen.

Looking at the NMR again: the 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H might be a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe an OCH2 structure. But then, where is the aldehyde?
