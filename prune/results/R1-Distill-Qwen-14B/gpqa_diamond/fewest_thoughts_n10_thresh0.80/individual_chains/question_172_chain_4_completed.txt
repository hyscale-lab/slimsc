Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given, 1.38e-23 J. They also mention that the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Right, LTE is when the gas is in thermal equilibrium, so the distribution of particles in energy states follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

I remember that the number of particles in a particular energy state is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh wait, where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, since we're talking about two stars, star_1 and star_2, I think I'll set up the ratios for each star and then relate them. The problem states that the number of excited iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, no, actually, wait. It says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the excitation level is higher in star_1.

Wait, no, maybe I misread. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, so the number of atoms in a specific excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for the same energy level, the population is higher in star_1.

Let me denote the energy levels as E1 and E2, but wait, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So the energy difference between the two considered levels is ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, but for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) would depend on their respective temperatures.

Wait, but since the same energy levels are being considered, the ΔE is the same for both stars. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state population to some reference state (maybe the ground state) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me think, so for star 1, the population ratio would be (n1_upper / n1_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE / (k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2, (n2_upper / n2_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE / (k T2) )

But the problem says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, but I'm not sure what exactly is being compared. Oh wait, the question says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read again. The problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or perhaps the ratio is higher, meaning more excitation.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to take the ratio of the excited state to the ground state for each star, then set up the ratio of those ratios.

So, let's define for each star the ratio n_upper / n_lower as R1 and R2.

So R1 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE / (k T1) )

R2 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE / (k T2) )

Given that, the question states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So I think the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

Wait, no, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe it's that the excitation level (population) is twice as high in star_1's energy level compared to star_2's. But I'm not entirely clear on what's being compared.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that in star_2. But that might not be directly applicable because the total number of atoms could vary, but the problem is about the excitation level. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation level is twice, so the ratio n_upper / n_lower is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

Yes, that makes sense. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Because if star_1 has a higher excitation level, then the population in the upper state relative to the lower is higher. So R1 = 2 R2.

Substituting R1 and R2:

(g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Oh wait, g_upper and g_lower are the statistical weights. If the same transition is being considered, then g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars. So we can cancel them out.

So, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Which is:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking natural log on both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Let me rearrange that:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question is about the equation involving T_1 and T_2, and the options don't involve ΔE. So perhaps I can express it in terms of temperatures.

But wait, the given options don't have any terms with ΔE. So perhaps the equation is rearranged to eliminate ΔE. However, since k is Boltzmann's constant, which is known, but the problem doesn't give any numbers except the ΔE, perhaps the equation can be rewritten without ΔE.

Wait, but the options don't involve ΔE, so maybe the equation is ln(2) = [something with T1 and T2].

Wait, let's go back. Let me rearrange the equation.

We have:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But the question is about the equation. So perhaps solving for (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) equals (k ln2) / ΔE.

Wait, but I don't think the options include any constants, so perhaps the structure of the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by (ΔE/k).

But since the options don't include ΔE, perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is R1 = 2 R2. Or maybe R1 / R2 = 2.

Wait, let me write R1 = 2 R2.

So [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = 2.

Wait, wait, the g factors for the same transition are same for both stars, so g1/g2 = g_upper/g_lower is same for both. So these cancel out.

Thus,

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2.

Which is,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2.

As before.

Taking natural logs:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which is,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options, which one matches this structure?

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But that would only be correct if ΔE/(k) equals 1, which isn't the case. Because we have (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But none of the options include ΔE or k.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Another approach: if the excitation is twice as high, the ratio R1 = 2 R2.

But then, taking the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for each star.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because I'm not considering the relative populations correctly. Maybe the ratio is n_upper/n_lower for star 1 is twice that for star 2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

But R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Dividing both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( -ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = 2.

Which is same as before.

So, ln(2) = -ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

But 1/T1 - 1/T2 is (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2). So,

ln(2) = -ΔE/(k) (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2 )

Which rearranged is,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, but the options don't have ΔE or k, so perhaps the given equation is independent of ΔE, which isn't possible. Unless ΔE is accounted for in another way.

Wait, but the problem gives us the ΔE, but the options don't include it. So perhaps I should express it in terms of the ratio of the temperatures, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the equation to get (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE.

But then that would make the equation:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/k )

But the options don't have ΔE or k, so perhaps this approach is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Let me think again. Maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice the number in star_2. But without knowing the total number of atoms, perhaps the ratio of the excited atoms to the total population is what's being considered. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is n_upper/(n_upper + n_lower) for each star, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward. Let me think about the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, for each star, the ratio R = n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, which would mean R1 is twice R2. So, R1 = 2 R2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2.

Take natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Which is,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, same as before.

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But the options don't have any terms with k or ΔE, so maybe the equation is presented in a different form. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the energy difference is such that (ΔE)/(k) is equal to a certain value, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, wait, going back. Let's consider that the equation is:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = [k ln(2)] / ΔE

But since the question doesn't give us the value of k or ΔE, perhaps the only way to relate T1 and T2 is to rearrange without the constants.

Wait, but the options are in terms of ln(2) equal to some expression involving T1 and T2. So perhaps the equation is rearranged as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So, in this case, the equation would be ln(2) equals [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] multiplied by (ΔE/k). But none of the options include ΔE or k.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps in the problem the initial setup is different. Maybe the ratio is that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Which might imply that the population in the excited state for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So n1_upper = 2 n2_upper.

But in that case, since n_upper = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T)) * n_lower.

Wait, but the ratio n_upper/n_lower is R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So for star_1, R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem says that n1_upper = 2 n2_upper. But n_upper is proportional to R * n_lower. So unless n_lower is the same for both stars, which it's not necessarily, because the overall density could vary.

So perhaps the assumption is that the ratio of R1 to R2 is 2. So R1/R2 = 2.

Which leads to exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2.

Which gives exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

So same as before. So,

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( T1 - T2 )/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But again, the options don't include ΔE or k.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by (ΔE/(k)).

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But that would require that (ΔE/(k)) equals 1, which is not the case, because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute (ΔE)/(k) to see if it's approximately 1.

Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So, ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh! So, ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Wow, that's a coincidence. So then, plugging back in:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we start by analyzing the excitation levels of iron atoms in the photospheres of star_1 and star_2. The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution governs the population of energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the upper and lower energy levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to lower states are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since the excitation level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we have:

\[
R_1 = 2 R_2.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \):

\[
\frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \) from both sides:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Now, substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):

\[
\frac{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})}{(1.38 \times 10^{-23})} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation given in **Option D**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
