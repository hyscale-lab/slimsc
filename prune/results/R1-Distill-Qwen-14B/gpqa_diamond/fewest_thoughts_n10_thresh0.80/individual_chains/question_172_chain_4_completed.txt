Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's try to think through this.

So, the setup is that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, wait. Wait, I need to clarify what "twice as excited" means. I think it refers to the excitation level, which probably relates to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The distribution of particles in different energy states depends on temperature.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that number looks familiar. 1.38 is about the Boltzmann constant, isn't it? Let me think: Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is equal to k times the temperature ratio? No, wait, the energy difference is ΔE = k*T. Wait, no. The energy levels are related to temperature through the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution: n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Or is it the other way around? Wait, higher energy level is upper, so if ΔE is the difference, then the lower level is at lower energy, so the upper level has higher energy.

Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, n_1_upper / n_1_lower = 2. For star_2, I guess the ratio is 1, because if star_1 is twice as excited, perhaps star_2 is at a lower temperature, so the ratio is 1? Or wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the excitation level is about how many atoms are in a higher energy state relative to the lower one. If the excitation is higher, more atoms are in the higher energy level. So if star_1 has twice as excited, then n1_upper/n1_lower = 2. While star_2 would have a different ratio. Wait, but the question states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, that's exactly equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k. Interesting.

So for each star, the ratio of the populations is determined by the temperature. Let me write the Boltzmann equation for each star.

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2
Wait, wait. Because the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Oh wait, no. The formula is n_upper = n_lower * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the ratio n_upper/n_lower is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but if ΔE is the energy difference from the lower to higher level.

Wait, no. Wait, the Boltzmann distribution is n_j/n_i = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ) where E_j > E_i. So if we have two energy levels, E_upper and E_lower, then the ratio is n_upper/n_lower = exp( -(E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E_upper - E_lower.

In this case, star_1 has a ratio of 2. So for star_1:

n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2.

Wait, but wait, 2 is a big ratio. Let me make sure: the higher the temperature, the more the population is in the upper level. Because at higher T, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is larger (since ΔE/(kT) is smaller, so negative of that is larger, so the exponential is larger). So if star_1's ratio is higher, it must have a higher temperature than star_2.

Wait, but the ratio is n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2: Let's say the ratio is 1. So 1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, that can't be right. Because if star_1's ratio is 2, the star_2's ratio would have to be something else. Wait, I think I need to figure out what the ratio is for star_2.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Hmm, perhaps that means that the ratio of upper to lower is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Or maybe it's the other way around? No, wait. Let me think again.

The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, that could be interpreted as the excitation potential or the level they're in. But in terms of population, perhaps it's the ratio of the number in the excited state to the ground state.

Wait, maybe the question is that in star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. No, the question says the excitation is twice as excited. Hmm, not entirely clear. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is twice for star_1, meaning that the ratio is higher. So I think the correct approach is to take for star_1, n1_upper/n1_lower = 2, and for star_2, n2_upper/n2_lower = 1.

Wait, but why would star_2 have a ratio of 1? That would imply that at higher energy level, the population is the same as the lower one. Which would be if ΔE/(k T2) is ln(1) which is zero. That would imply ΔE/(k T2) = 0, so T2 approaches infinity. But that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption here.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1. But that can't be because when the ratio is 1, the populations are the same, which would require that the exponent is zero.

Alternatively, maybe star_2 has a ratio of something else, perhaps star_2's ratio is 0.5, but that's just a guess. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, maybe the ratio is higher for star_1. So if star_1 has a higher temperature, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is higher.

Wait, let's think about the equations.

For star_1: ratio1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2.

Wait, that would mean that -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2), so ΔE/(k T1) = -ln(2). But this can't be possible because ΔE and k T1 are positive, so the right-hand side is negative. That can't be correct. So perhaps I have the equation inverted.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n_lower / n_upper = 2 for star_1, but that would mean more atoms are in the lower state. But the question says the atoms are more excited, so I think more are in the higher state. So the ratio should be n_upper/n_lower = 2.

But then if I take the equation as:

n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Take natural log of both sides: ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

So, ΔE/(k T1 ) = - ln(2)

But ΔE is positive and k T1 is positive, so this would give a negative value. Which is impossible. So perhaps I have the equation inverted.

Wait, maybe I should write the ratio as n_lower / n_upper = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Because if the higher energy level is less populated, then n_lower is higher.

Wait, let's get it right. The Boltzmann factor is:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k T) )

Which is equal to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So if n_upper/n_lower = 2, then exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

Taking ln: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

So ΔE/(k T1 ) = -ln(2)

But since ΔE is positive, and k T1 is positive, the left side is positive. So the right side is negative. That's impossible, so perhaps I flipped the ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's n_lower / n_upper = 2. Then:

n_lower/n_upper = 2 = exp( (E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ) = exp(ΔE/(k T) )

Ah, that makes more sense. Because then:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k T1 )

But wait, then ΔE/(k T1 ) = ln(2)

But ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k T1 ) = 1 / T1 = ln(2)

So 1/T1 = ln(2) → T1 = 1/(ln 2). But wait, let's compute that.

Wait, but T1 would be 1/(ln2) K, which is about 1.44 K, which seems way too low for a star. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again.

Wait, star_1 has more excitation, so more atoms in the upper level. So n_upper is higher. So n_upper/n_lower = 2.

So that's correct. So:

2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

So ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

Which gives ΔE/(k T1 ) = -ln(2)

But ΔE is positive, so this would require that T1 is negative, which is impossible. So this can't be correct.

Hmm, maybe I have the equation backward. Let me think about the Boltzmann factor again. The distribution is n_j = n_i exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ) * g_j/g_i, but assuming same degeneracy, it's n_j/n_i = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

So if E_j > E_i, and T is high, then (E_j - E_i)/(k T) is small, so the exponential is close to 1, meaning n_j ~ n_i.

If T is low, then (E_j - E_i)/(k T) is large, so exponential is small, so n_j << n_i.

So if star_1 has higher excitation (n_j/n_i = 2), that means that the term (E_j - E_i)/(k T1) is small. So E_j - E_i is ΔE, so ΔE/(k T1) is small, meaning T1 is large.

So for star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Take natural log: ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

Multiply both sides by -1: -ln(2) = ΔE/(k T1 )

So ΔE/(k T1 ) = -ln(2) → 1/(T1) = - ln(2) * (k ) / ΔE

Wait, but this can't be right because T1 is positive. So perhaps I'm using the wrong ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n_lower / n_upper = 2. Then:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k T1) )

So ln(2) = ΔE/(k T1 )

Which gives T1 = ΔE/(k ln(2)).

But since ΔE = k, as ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J = k. So ΔE = k → k T1 = ΔE * ln(2)

Wait, wait: T1 = ΔE/(k ln(2)) ) → since ΔE = k → T1 = k/(k ln(2)) ) = 1/ln(2) ≈ 1.44 K. Again, that's too low for a star's effective temperature.

Wait, but stars are way hotter than that. So perhaps I'm confused about the setup.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is the other way around. Maybe n1_upper/n1_lower = 2. So ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

→ ΔE/(k T1 ) = -ln(2 )

But since ΔE and k are positive, this implies T1 is negative, which is impossible. So this can't be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, it's 1.

Wait, but for star_2, the ratio would be 1, which would imply ΔE/(k T2) = 0 → T2 approaches infinity, which is impossible.

So maybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps using the ratio for both stars.

So for star_1: n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2_upper/n2_lower = 1 (since it's less excited). So 1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking the second equation: ln(1) = 0 = -ΔE/(k T2 ) → ΔE = 0 → which is not possible because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe star_2's ratio is something else. Perhaps the ratio is 0.5, meaning n_upper/n_lower is 0.5.

Wait, let's try that.

So for star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: 0.5 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take the natural log for both.

For star_1: ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

→ ΔE/(k T1 ) = -ln(2 )

Again, same problem as before.

For star_2: ln(0.5) = -ΔE/(k T2 )

Which is ln(0.5) = ln(1/2) = -ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T2 )

→ ΔE/(k T2 ) = ln(2 )

So, from star_1: ΔE/(k T1 ) = -ln(2 )

From star_2: ΔE/(k T2 ) = ln(2 )

But wait, ΔE is positive, and T is positive. So for star_1, the left side is ΔE/(k T1 ), which is positive, but the right is negative. So that can't be possible.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this with the assumption that the excitation is in LTE, which is given. So perhaps using the ratio for both stars.

Let me write the Boltzmann factor for each star.

Star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 → Equation (1)

Star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = ? 

But the question states that star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. Hmm, perhaps the ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. But that leads to the same problem as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the excitation is higher in star_1, meaning that the ratio is higher. So star_1's ratio is 2, star_2's ratio is less than 2, perhaps 1.

Wait, but then for star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

→ ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

→ ΔE/(k T1 ) = -ln(2 ), which is impossible because LHS is positive.

So perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ionization state, but I think it's about the excitation between two energy levels.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio between the two stars. Let me denote the ratio of star_1 to star_2.

So let me write the ratio for star_1 and star_2.

n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 (as per the question)
n2_upper / n2_lower = x

So according to the question, star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So perhaps x is 1, meaning star_2's ratio is 1. But same issue as before.

Alternatively, maybe the excitation is such that the population in the upper level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the excitation is twice as high, which would relate to the ionization potential or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the populations is 2 for star_1, and 1 for star_2.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that the ratio of the populations is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, and we can relate the temperatures.

Taking the ratio of the two ratios (star_1 over star_2):

(n1_upper/n1_lower) / (n2_upper/n2_lower) ) = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] 

Which is exp( ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

The question states that star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower)

But I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation level is directly proportional to the ratio. So if star_1 is twice as excited, then (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the excitation level is given as a ratio of 2:1 between the two stars.

Wait, perhaps let's suppose that the ratio for star_1 is 2 and for star_2 is 1. Then:

For star_1: 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: 1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking star_2's equation: ln(1)=0 → -ΔE/(k T2 )=0 → ΔE=0, which is impossible, so that can't be.

So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the energy difference and the relation to temperature.

Given that ΔE = 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So for star_1:

n1_upper/n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = exp( -1/T1 )

Set this equal to 2:

exp(-1/T1) = 2 → take ln: -1/T1 = ln(2) → T1 = -1/(ln(2)) → negative, impossible.

Hmm, impossible. So perhaps the ratio is 1/2 instead.

Wait, if star_1 has the ratio 0.5:

exp(-1/T1) = 0.5 → ln(0.5) = -1/T1 → ln(1/2) = -ln(2) → -ln(2) = -1/T1 → T1 = 1/ln(2) ≈ 1.44 K. Again, way too low.

But that can't be, so perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the ratio of upper to lower, but the ratio of the number of excited atoms between the two stars. Like, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. But that would require knowing the total number of atoms, which I don't think is given.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the excitation energy being twice as much, but that's not directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the ionization degree. But the question says "excited in a specific energy level", so it's about the population in a particular energy level, not ionization.

Hmm. Let me try to think about the equations again.

We have for each star:

n_upper/n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Star_1: n1_upper/n1_lower = 2.

Star_2: n2_upper/n2_lower = x.

But what is x? The question says star_1 is twice as excited as star_2, but I'm not sure how that translates into the ratio. 

Wait, maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So 2 = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower) → which implies that (n2_upper/n2_lower) = 1.

Which again brings us back to the same problem as earlier.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should take the two equations for star_1 and star_2 and find a relation between T1 and T2.

So for star_1: ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

For star_2: let's suppose that the ratio is 1 → ln(1)=0 → ΔE/(k T2) = 0 → T2 is infinite. That can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps star_2 has a lower ratio, say, 0.5. So for star_2: 0.5 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

ln(0.5) = -ΔE/(k T2 )

→ ΔE/(k T2 ) = ln(2)

So from star_1: ΔE/(k T1 ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but earlier we saw that ΔE = k → ΔE/(k T) = 1/T

So for star_1: 1/T1 = ln(2 )

→ T1 = 1/ln(2) ≈ 1.44 K.

Star_2: 1/T2 = ln(2 )

Wait, same as star_1. So T1 = T2, which can't be right.

Hmm, I must be making a mistake here. Let me try to approach this from another angle.

Let me denote the two equations:

For star_1: n1_upper/n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 → Equation (1)

For star_2: n2_upper/n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) → Equation (2)

But since the question says star_1 is twice as excited as star_2, perhaps star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's.

Wait, that is, n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower )

So:

2 = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower )

→ n2_upper/n2_lower = 1.

Again, same problem as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is 4 times as much? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation implies that the ionization is higher, but I think that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe I should express the two equations and find a relation between T1 and T2.

From equation (1): ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

From equation (2): let's say that star_2 has a ratio of 1 → ln(1) = 0 = -ΔE/(k T2 )

Which would require that ΔE = 0, which is impossible.

So that can't be. Thus, perhaps the ratio for star_2 is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the excitation is twice as high in star_1, but not necessarily the ratio being twice. Maybe it refers to the ionization temperature or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the excitation being higher, so that the exponent is lower, leading to higher population in the upper level.

Wait, perhaps instead of using the ratio, I should think in terms of the temperature dependence. Since ΔE is given as k, the Boltzmann factor becomes exp(-1/T).

So, for star_1: exp(-1/T1) = 2 → impossible because exp(-x) is always less than or equal to 1.

Wait, so that can't be. So maybe I have to invert the ratio.

So, n_lower/n_upper = 2 → exp(1/T1 ) = 2 → ln(2) = 1/T1 → T1 = 1/ln(2) ≈1.44 K, which is not plausible.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Perhaps I should look at the answer options to see which form makes sense.

The options are:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )^2

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, perhaps none of these involve a reciprocal, but let's think about the equations.

From the earlier approach, for star_1 and star_2, let's say that n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 = exp( -1/T1 )

Similarly, for star_2, perhaps n2_upper/n2_lower = 1 → exp( -1/T2 ) =1 → T2 is infinite, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps star_2's ratio is 1/2.

So, for star_1: 2 = exp( -1/T1 )

For star_2: 0.5 = exp( -1/T2 )

So:

ln(2) = -1/T1 → T1 = -1/ln(2 ) → impossible.

ln(0.5) = -1/T2 → -ln(2 )= -1/T2 → T2= 1/ln(2 )

But then T2 is about 1.44 K, which is again too low. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, maybe I need to take the ratio of the two equations.

Taking the ratio of (n1_upper/n1_lower) to (n2_upper/n2_lower):

[2] / [x] = exp( (-1/T1) ) / exp( (-1/T2) ) ) = exp( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But I'm not sure what x is. The question states that star_1's excitation is twice as much as star_2's, but I'm not exactly sure how that translates.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is directly proportional to the ratio n_upper/n_lower. So star_1 has twice the excitation, so n1/n_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n_lower )

But without knowing x, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the excitation is given by the term in the exponent, and relate the temperatures.

Wait, if star_1 has a higher temperature, the exponent is smaller, so the ratio n_upper/n_lower is larger. So star_1 has a higher T, so the ratio is larger.

So, for star_1, ratio1 = 2.

For star_2, ratio2 = 1.

But then, as before, star_2's ratio gives T2 as infinite, which is impossible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible answer options.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which can be written as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Because (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

Hmm, I wonder if that's the case.

Wait, from star_1: ln(2) = 1/T1 → T1 = 1/ln(2 )

From star_2: ln(1)=0 → 1/T2 = 0 → T2 → infty. Not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the ratio for star_2 is 0.5. So:

For star_1: 2 = exp( -1/T1 )

→ ln(2) = -1/T1 → T1 = -1/ln(2 )

Impossible.

For star_2: 0.5 = exp( -1/T2 )

→ ln(0.5 )= -1/T2 → T2= 1/(ln(2 )) → 1.44 K.

But then, what's the relation between T1 and T2?

Wait, no, because T1 would be negative, which is impossible.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ratio of the two equations.

We have for star_1 and star_2:

ln(2 ) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

and 

ln(x) = -ΔE/(k T2 )

Taking the ratio of the two:

ln(2)/ln(x) = (T2)/(T1 )

But I don't know x.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Saha equation, but I think the Saha equation involves ionization, not excitation between energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excitation is 2, so for star_1, the exponent is smaller by some factor that relates T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to set up the two equations and subtract.

Wait, from star_1: ln(2) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

From star_2: let me assume that the ratio for star_2 is 1, which would give ln(1)=0 → which can't be.

But perhaps instead, the question refers to the fact that the excitation is twice as much, so the ratio is higher by a factor that depends on the temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the excitation energy is proportional to T.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me look for a different approach.

Alternative approach:

The excitation energy is given by ΔE = k T. Because ΔE = k T → when T is such that k T equals ΔE, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) = exp(-1) ≈ 0.3679. So, a small ratio.

But in our case, ΔE is given as k, so ΔE = k → T = 1 K.

But the question states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1, so perhaps T1 is twice T2?

Wait, no. Because the ratio depends exponentially on 1/T.

Wait, another approach: write the two equations.

For star_1: n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 = exp( -1/T1 )

→ ln(2) = -1/T1 → T1 = -1/ln(2 )

Impossible.

Wait, so perhaps the ratio is inverted.

n_lower / n_upper = 2 → exp(1/T1 ) = 2 → T1 = 1/ln(2 ) ≈ 1.44 K.

For star_2: n_lower/n_upper = 1 → exp(1/T2 ) =1 → T2 → infinity. Again, impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. That could mean that the ionization temperature is higher, but I think it's about the excitation state.

Wait, perhaps the excitation is such that the ratio of the populations is higher. So, for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2, the ratio is 1. But I'm back to the same problem where T2 becomes infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1, but it's not about the ratio. Maybe it's about the number of excited atoms being twice as much. So, n1_upper = 2 n2_upper.

But without knowing the total number of atoms, I can't relate the two.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is higher in star_1, implying that the temperature is higher, leading to a higher ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that T1 is higher than T2. So, the ratio for star_1 is higher than that of star_2.

So, let me write the two equations:

For star_1: n1_upper/n1_lower = exp( -1/T1 ) = 2 → ln(2 ) = -1/T1 → T1 = -1/ln(2 )

Impossible.

For star_2: let me assume that the ratio is 1 → ln(1 )=0 → T2 → infty.

No, not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fact that the excitation is twice as much, so the energy per atom is higher, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the ratio of the two temperatures.

Let me suppose that T1 is higher than T2, so star_1 is hotter. Let me write:

From star_1: ln(2 ) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

From star_2: let's say that the ratio is 1 → ln(1 )=0 = -ΔE/(k T2 )

Which again, ΔE must be zero, which is impossible.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the possible answer choices.

The correct equation should involve a relation between T1 and T2 that comes from the Boltzmann factors.

Let me think about the two equations:

ln(2) = - ΔE/(k T1 )

ΔE/(k T1 ) = - ln(2 )

Similarly, for star_2, if I can find another equation involving T2.

Wait, perhaps the question is that star_1 has a ratio of 2, and star_2 has a ratio of 1/2. So:

Star_1: ln(2 ) = -1/T1 → T1 = -1/ln(2 )

Star_2: ln(0.5 )= -1/T2 → -ln(2) = -1/T2 → T2 = 1/ln(2 )

But then T1 is negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the setup is incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: Consider that the two stars have the same ΔE, and their excitation ratios are related.

So, for star_1: 2 = exp( -1/T1 )

For star_2: x = exp( -1/T2 )

But without knowing x, I can't find a relation between T1 and T2.

Wait, but the question says that star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So, perhaps the excitation is proportional to the ratio of the populations.

So, star_1: 2 * (excitation of star_2) = excitation of star_1.

But I'm not sure how to relate this.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the same in both stars, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the question is about the effective temperatures leading to the given excitation. So, the ratio between the temperatures would come from the ratio of the excitation.

Wait, the ratio of the excitation (n_upper/n_lower) is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2.

But then, as before, star_2's equation gives T2 as infinity.

Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the option that fits the only plausible scenario.

Looking back, the options are:

A) ln(2) = [ T2 / T1 ]

B) ln(2) = [ (T1 + T2) / (T1*T2) ]

C) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]

D) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2) ]

Hmm, option D can be rewritten as ln(2 )= (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which is the same as 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2 )

Which implies 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2 )

So, if T1 is higher, T2 would be lower.

But from earlier, when I tried to set star_1's ratio to 2, I found T1 = 1/ln(2 ), but that leads to negative temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the ratio of the two equations leads to option D.

Let me think: From star_1 and star_2, I can write their equations.

Equation for star_1: ln(2 ) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

Equation for star_2: let's say that the ratio is 1, but that leads to T2 = infinity. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for star_2 is 0.5, so:

ln(0.5 )= -ΔE/(k T2 )

So, ln(0.5 )= -1/T2 → T2 = 1/ln(2 )

Now, from star_1, we have ln(2 ) = -1/T1 → T1 = -1/ln(2 ), which is impossible.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to take the difference in the equations.

Another approach: Let me write the two equations.

Equation 1: ln(2 ) = -ΔE/(k T1 )

Equation 2: ln(1) = 0 = -ΔE/(k T2 )

But this implies ΔE=0, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps star_2 has a ratio of 0.5.

So Equation 2: ln(0.5 )= -ΔE/(k T2 )

So, ln(0.5 )= -1/T2 → T2= 1/ln(2 ) ≈1.44 K

But then from Equation 1: ln(2 )= -1/T1 → T1 = -1/ln(2 ), which is negative. Impossible.

Hmm.

Maybe I should consider the ratio of the two equations. Let me take the ratio of the two equations.

Equation 1: ln(2 ) = -1/T1 → -1/T1 = ln(2 )

Equation 2: Let's say star_2's ratio is x → ln(x ) = -1/T2 → -1/T2 = ln(x )

So, the ratio of equation 1 to equation 2 is:

(ln(2 )) / ln(x ) = ( -1/T1 ) / ( -1/T2 ) ) → (T2)/(T1) = ln(2)/ln(x )

But I don't know x.

Wait, but the question states that star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So perhaps x is 1 (star_2's ratio is 1), but that leads to T2 being infinite, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps star_2's ratio is 0.5, so x=0.5 → ln(0.5 )= -ln(2 )

So, the ratio becomes:

(ln(2 )) / (-ln(2 )) ) = T2/T1 → -1 = T2/T1 → T2 = -T1 → impossible.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think about the options again. The only option that seems to involve a T2 higher than T1 is option A, but I don't think that's the case. Because higher T would lead to higher excitation.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio inverted. Let me think again about the population ratio.

If star_1's ratio is higher, then T1 is higher. So, for star_1, n_upper/n_lower is higher than star_2's.

So, let me let the ratio for star_2 be r. Then, for star_1, the ratio is 2r.

So, for star_1: 2 r = exp( -1/T1 )

For star_2: r = exp( -1/T2 )

Divide the two equations: (2 r ) / r = [ exp(-1/T1) ] / [ exp(-1/T2) ] → 2 = exp( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Take ln: ln(2 ) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2 ) = (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

Ah, that makes sense! So the correct equation is option D: ln(2 ) = (T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2, and the energy difference between the relevant energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). The Boltzmann distribution governs the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1, the ratio of populations is given as 2, so:

\[
2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = -\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \), this simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = -\frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

For star_2, let the population ratio be \( r \). Then:

\[
r = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(r) = -\frac{1}{T_2}.
\]

The problem states that star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. Assuming this means the population ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2, we have:

\[
2r = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad r = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing these two equations:

\[
\frac{2r}{r} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship. For example:

- **Option A** (\( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \)) does not align with the derived equation.
- **Option B** (\( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \)) introduces an incorrect additive term in the numerator.
- **Option C** (\( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \)) incorrectly squares the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
