Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about titration, specifically involving acetic acid and sodium hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that titration involves neutralizing a solution with another to determine concentration or pH changes.

So, the setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

The options given are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values. So, I need to calculate both the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence.

First, let me outline what I know:

1. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid, and it reacts with NaOH, a strong base, in a neutralization reaction. The reaction should produce acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and water.

2. The initial concentrations and volumes are important. The initial solution is diluted, so I need to calculate the new concentration after dilution.

3. For the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present after dilution.

4. The 25% titration point means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, I'll have to calculate the moles of acid and base at that point.

Let me start by calculating the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So, for the initial acetic acid:
Moles = Molarity × Volume(L)
Volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02 L.
Moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, we dilute this with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ or 0.04 L.

The new concentration after dilution will be:
M = moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let me calculate the volume of NaOH needed for that.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH after dilution is 0.001 moles. So, moles NaOH = 0.001.

Volume NaOH = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration, which is 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Alternatively, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let me think again. Since at equivalence, all of the acetic acid is neutralized, 25% titration means 25% of the moles have been neutralized.

So, moles of NaOH added at 25% = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Alternatively, the volume of NaOH is (0.00025 moles) / (0.1 M) = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. That makes sense.

So, for each scenario, I'll need to calculate the pH.

Let me tackle each part step by step.

First, the equivalence point.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions (CH3COO^-). So, the solution will consist of the conjugate base of a weak acid. Since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, which is a weak acid, the solution will be basic. So, the pH should be greater than 7.

To find the pH at equivalence, I can consider the hydrolysis of the acetate ion in water.

The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw = Ka × Kb. We're given Ka as 1.85e-5. So, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait. Wait, Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So, Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10.

But wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. Hmm, 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9, which is 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10.

Now, the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point.

At equivalence, the solution is made by mixing the diluted acetic acid (40 cm³) with 10 cm³ of NaOH. So, total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

The moles of acetate ions are 0.001 moles (since all the acetic acid is converted to acetate).

Concentration of acetate, [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So, acetate is a weak base. Let me set up the Kb expression.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ [CH3COOH][OH^-] / 0.02.

But since Kb is very small, the change in concentration of acetate will be negligible, so we can approximate.

Let me let x = [OH^-]. Then,

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

So, x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So, [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 8.515.

Hmm, looking at the options, the equivalence point pHs are 8.52 (option A), 6.73 (B), 7 (C), 6.92 (D). So this would be about 8.52, which is option A's second value. But let me check the other parts.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, another approach for the equivalence point is to consider the concentration of the resulting solution. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the volume.

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (0.001 moles). Adding 10 cm³ of NaOH (0.1 M, 0.001 moles) gives a total of 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So, the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

So, Kb is correctly calculated as 5.405e-10. Then, Kb = x² / 0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.517. So, log(3.288e-6) is 0.517 -6 = -5.483. Thus, pOH is 5.483, so pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517. So approximately 8.52. So the equivalence pH is about 8.52. That matches option A's second value, but let's look at the options.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

So that's one possibility. But let's proceed to the next part.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react completely with acetic acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 moles.

Moles NaOH added: 0.00025.

So, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

So, the solution now contains both acetic acid and its conjugate base. This is a buffer solution.

To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Where [A^-] is the concentration of acetate ions, and [HA] is the concentration of acetic acid.

First, calculate pKa. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, the concentrations of A^- and HA.

Total volume is initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added? Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, [HA] = 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

So, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = 4.733 + log
