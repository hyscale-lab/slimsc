Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the answer choices are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely. But when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid to form acetate ions.

First, I need to figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated using Molarity (M) = moles/volume (L). So moles CH3COOH = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. Oh no, wait: the initial concentration is 0.05 M, volume 20 cm³. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. So for equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't directly asking about the equivalence point volume, but about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

Wait, the question says what is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2
