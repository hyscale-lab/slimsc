Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. They observed it for 50 minutes and it didn't decay. Now, they want to know the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, noâ€”actually, the question says after 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, no, the question says, wait, the time is 50 minutes passed and it hasn't decayed. So, I think the next period is 150 minutes, but perhaps I should clarify the exact wording.

Wait, the question says: "What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So after the initial 50 minutes, they're looking at the next 150. Or is it the remaining time? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the setup says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the half-life or decay constant is such that the probability for 100 minutes is 32%. Then, after 50 minutes without decaying, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should model this using the radioactive decay formula. Radioactive
