Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The reaction given is Pi+ → mu+ + nu, where Pi+ is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. The options are different pairs of kinetic energies for the product particles. I need to find the right one.

Wait, I remember that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, their energies and momenta are related. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. That makes sense because momentum is conserved.

So, let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion. After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The pion's rest mass energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, but the neutrino is a different story. Wait, I'm not sure about the neutrino's rest mass. Oh right, neutrinos are considered massless in many problems, especially in particle physics at the high school or basic college level. So I'll treat the neutrino's rest mass as zero.

Let me denote the muon as mu+ and the neutrino as nu. Let me think in terms of four-momentum. The initial four-momentum is (E, 0) where E is the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the four-momenta of mu+ and nu add up to this.

Each particle's energy and momentum can be described. For the muon, energy E_mu = sqrt( (p)^2c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2, but since I'm working in units where c=1, it's just sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ). Similarly, since the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu = p.

Also, because momentum is conserved, the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = p (vector) and p_nu = -p (vector). But as scalars, their magnitudes are equal, p.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

This must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV. So:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = 139.6

Let me let x = p. Then the equation is sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, I can try solving for x. Let me rearrange:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Square both sides:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

So subtract x^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute the numbers:

105.7 squared is about 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that:

105^2 is 11025. Then 0.7^2 is 0.49. Then cross terms: 2*105*0.7 = 147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

139.6 squared is approximately 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute 140^2 = 19600, subtract 0.4*280 (since (140-0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4²), so 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. But wait, 139.6 is 140 minus 0.4, so
