Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already detected these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars are different. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger, but in this case, they're the same radius. Maybe Planet_1's star is more evolved, or perhaps it's a main-sequence star that's more massive but not expanded yet.

The options are about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So I need to calculate the transit probability for each and see which is higher.

I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh wait, but since they're using RV, they already have the orbital period and mass, but for transit probability, it's about the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on enough for the planet to pass in front of the star from our perspective.

The probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (1/(e)), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for circular orbits, the transit probability simplifies. I think the formula is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but actually, more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a), but since Earth-like planets are small compared to stars, R_p is negligible, so it's approximately (R_star) / a. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the circle where the planet can transit (which depends on the star's size) divided by the area of the planet's orbit. Or perhaps more accurately, it's the probability that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on, would cause a transit. So the
