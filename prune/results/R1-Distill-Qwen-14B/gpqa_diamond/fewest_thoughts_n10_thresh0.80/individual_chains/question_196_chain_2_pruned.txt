Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like in a spring. But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess we have to consider relativistic effects here, which probably means using the Lorentz factor or something related to special relativity.

The problem states that the oscillator is 1-dimensional, with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So, it's similar to a regular harmonic oscillator, but in relativity. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A to D, each involving some formula with c, k, m, and A.

First, I need to recall how the maximum speed in a harmonic oscillator works, both in the classical (non-relativistic) case and the relativistic case.

In the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = (k A) / m, right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) is (1/2)kA², which converts to kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², which leads to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = (k A)/m * sqrt(1/(something?)) Wait, sqrt(k²A²/m²) is kA/m. So yes, v_max = kA/m in the classical case. So option C is that, but wait, option C is sqrt(kA^2/m) which is same as kA/m. So that's the classical case. But since this is a relativistic problem, the answer should involve some kind of relativistic correction.

In special relativity, velocities can't reach the speed of light. So, the energy and momentum equations change. For a relativistic particle, the total energy is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

But wait, in this problem, the oscillator is obeying Hooke's law, but it's relativistic. So I think the potential energy can't be just (1/2)kx² anymore, because relativistic effects come into play.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is no longer quadratic in x. Wait, but wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So maybe the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the equation of motion incorporates relativistic corrections. Hmm, maybe we can model it using relativistic mechanics.

So the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator isn't the same as the classical one. The force F = -kx should be considered in the relativistic framework. So let's think about how the equations of motion work in relativity.

In Newtonian mechanics, F = ma = m dv/dt. But relativistically, F is d(p)/dt, where p is gamma m v. So F = d/dt (gamma m v).

So F = m d/dt (gamma v). And since F
