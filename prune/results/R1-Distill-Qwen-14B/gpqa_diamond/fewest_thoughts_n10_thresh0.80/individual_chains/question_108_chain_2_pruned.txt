Okay, so I've got this question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, which I think means it's like m=0 or maybe ±1. I remember that the orbital magnetic quantum number can be -l, -(l-1), ..., 0, ..., l-1, l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So if m is small, maybe l is small too, like in s or p orbitals.

The paramagnetic coupling term is the term in the Hamiltonian due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the electron's magnetic moment. I'm pretty sure this is the Zeeman effect, where the energy shift is given by something like -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is related to the spin and orbital angular momentum. But wait, here it's the orbital contribution because the question specifies the orbital magnetic quantum number m.

So the paramagnetic term, which I'll call H', is proportional to m and B. Because the magnetic field is along Oz, the term would be something like H' = -μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, the orbital part is given by the Landé g-factor, but for hydrogen, the g-factor is approximately 1. So for orbital contribution, the energy shift would be ΔE_param = g * μ_B * m * B, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Wait, no, I think the orbital term is μ_B * m * B. Wait, correction: the Zeeman term is H' = (μ_B * m) * B, but I might have the sign wrong. Either way, the magnitude is proportional to m*B.

Now, the other part is the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom with wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. That's the Balmer series, right? The λ=486.1 nm corresponds to the transition from n=2 to n=1? Wait, no, wait. The Balmer series has transitions ending at n=2. Let me think: n=3 to n=2 is about 656 nm (red), n=4 to n=2 is about 486 nm (blue-green), so yeah, that's the 486 nm line. So the energy ΔE for that transition is given by the Rydberg formula.

What's the energy of that photon? The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. So the wavelength λ = 0.4861e-6 meters. The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R*(1/(n_final^2) - 1/(n_initial^2)). Here, n_final is 2 and n_initial is 4, because 1/(2^2) - 1/(4^2) = 1/4 - 1/16 = 3/16. So 1/λ = R*(3/16). Let me compute that.

R is about 1.097e7 m⁻¹. So 1/λ = 1.097e7 * (3/16) ≈ (1.097e7) * 0.1875 ≈ 2.03e6 m⁻¹. Then λ ≈ 4.93e-7 meters, which is about 493 nm, but our given λ is 486.1 nm. Hmm, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should get the exact energy. The transition energy ΔE is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e
