Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator corresponding to a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

The problem says the operator is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The direction we're looking at is an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. Oh wait, direction vectors in the x-z plane have their y-component zero, so n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P along n. So I think that means I need to find the eigenvalue equation for the operator P · n. Because when you have an operator in a specific direction, you use the dot product of the operator vector with the direction vector.

So the operator we're interested in is P_n = P · n. Let me write that out. P · n is nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny=0, so it becomes P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Each of the P components is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ
