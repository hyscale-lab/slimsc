Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about the eigenvector for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states with definite values.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the overall operator P along direction n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine.

Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, the unit vector in the direction of n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Oh wait, wait, actually, wait—the x-z plane implies that the angle is measured from the x-axis or the z-axis? Hmm. Typically, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. But since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So yeah, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is from the z-axis.

So the operator P along n would be the sum of (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z). But n_y is zero, so Py term drops out. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that, let me write down each component:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix.
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix.
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So P_n = (n_x)(Px) + (n_z)(Pz).

Substituting the matrices, that would be (n_x)(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z)(ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me factor out ħ/2: (ħ/2)[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, wait. Let me compute each component separately. The first term is n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]], and the second term is n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]]. So adding these together, the matrix becomes:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

So P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the
