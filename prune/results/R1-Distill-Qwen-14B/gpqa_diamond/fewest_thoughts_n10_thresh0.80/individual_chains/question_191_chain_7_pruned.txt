Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the final product looks like. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions.

The question starts with the compound 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I think I should draw its structure to visualize it better. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and at position 5, a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So that would be CH2-C(CH2)–something. Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent attached at the middle carbon. So it's CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached at the second carbon? Or wait, maybe the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the middle carbon. So actually, the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between 1 and 2, so it's CH2=C-CH2-? Wait, no, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between 1 and 2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- but the substituent is at position 2. So the group is CH2 attached to the cyclohexane, then a double bond to another CH2? Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. So, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as vinyl group attached via the middle carbon. So it's like CH2-CH2-CH2, but double bond between 1 and 2, so the substituent is CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Maybe it's isopropenyl, which is (CH2)2C=CH2? No, wait, isopropenyl is CH2=C(CH3)-, so maybe that's what's meant here.

Wait, let me get the structure right. The starting material is 3-hydroxymethyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexanone. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone (O) at position 1. Position 3 has a CH2OH group. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is CH2–C(CH2)– something? Alternatively, is it CH2–CH2–CH2 with the double bond between 1 and 2, attached at the middle? Maybe it's better to think of it as CH2=CH–CH2– attached at the middle, which would make it a substituent at position 5. So, that would be (CH2)CH2–CH2– with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just proceed.

First step: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So, perhaps the NaH deprotonates something, and then benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group.

Looking at the starting material, where are acidic protons? Sodium hydride is a strong base (pKa around 50?), so it can deprotonate any acidic protons. Let me think: the starting compound has an alcohol (hydroxymethyl), a ketone, and an alkene. The hydroxymethyl's OH would be acidic (pKa around 16-18?), maybe. The alpha protons to the ketone are also somewhat acidic, but NaH is a strong base, so it's more likely to deprotonate the OH group, generating an alkoxide.

So, the hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH) would become –CH2O–, and then benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) would alkylate it. So, the O– would attack the benzyl bromide, replacing Br with O– and CH2Ph.

Wait, but wait: when you have an alkoxide, the attack would be on the benzyl bromide. The benzyl bromide is a primary alkyl halide, so the substitution would proceed via an SN2 mechanism. So the O– would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to the formation of an ether. So the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether.

Wait, but wait: the starting compound has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3. So after NaH, that becomes an alkoxide: O–. Then benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group to the oxygen. So the product would have a benzyl ether group where the hydroxymethyl was.

So product 1 would be 3-((benzyl)oxy)methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the sodium hydride deprotonates the alpha hydrogen of the ketone, but which is more acidic: the alpha protons (which are around pKa 20-25) or the hydroxymethyl's OH (pKa ~16-18)? I think the hydroxymethyl's OH is more acidic, so NaH would deprotonate that. So the O– would be formed, then benzyl bromide would add, giving the ether.

So product 1 is the starting material but with the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) replaced by CH2OCH2Ph (benzyl ether? Wait, no, wait, benzyl bromide is PhCH2Br. When the O– attacks, it would form OCH2Ph. So the group
