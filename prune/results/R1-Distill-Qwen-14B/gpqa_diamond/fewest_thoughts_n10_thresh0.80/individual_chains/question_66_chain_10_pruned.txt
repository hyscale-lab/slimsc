Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, what's SMEFT again? Oh right, it's the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework where you write down all possible interactions (operators) compatible with the Standard Model symmetries, but including higher-dimensional terms. So the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options given are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The question asks which of these must be respected by all operators.

First, I need to recall what each symmetry means.

Lorentz symmetry: This includes rotations and boosts, right? So the theory must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. Operators must transform accordingly.

Poincare symmetry: That's the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. So it includes momentum conservation, energy-momentum tensor, etc. But wait, isn't Lorentz symmetry part of Poincare? So if you have Poincare, you have Lorentz. But the question is which must be respected. I think SMEFT must respect both, but maybe they're considered separately here.

Wait, the SMEFT operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So any operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. So option 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes translations, which implies momentum conservation. SMEFT is a theory in a fixed spacetime background, but it's still a Lorentz-invariant theory, so I think Poincare symmetry is also required. Or wait, does SMEFT already include the Poincare symmetry because it's part of the framework? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the Standard Model itself respects both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So SMEFT, being an effective theory built on the SM, should also respect these. So both 1 and 2 would be required. So that would mean options A, which includes 1 and 2, is correct, or perhaps something else.

But wait, let me think again. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each individual operator must be invariant under these symmetries.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry is more than just Lorentz. The P
