Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these, so I need to figure out which ones are mandatory.

Wait, wait. Let me remember. SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators that are compatible with the Standard Model symmetries. So the operators have to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself. Right, because SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM as a subset.

So the Standard Model has certain symmetries. The gauge group is SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), but that's more about gauge symmetry. But the question is about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Lorentz symmetry is about spacetime symmetries. The SM is Lorentz invariant, so all operators in SMEFT must respect that. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, it's also Poincare invariant as long as it's translationally invariant. Wait, but in a theory like SMEFT, which includes all possible operators, do they automatically respect translation invariance?

Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories are typically built to respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory. So the SM is a Poincare-invariant theory, so SMEFT must also respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2, Poincare, must be respected. So that would mean both 1 and 2 are required.

Next, CP symmetry. The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry. Some parts of the SM are CP symmetric, but the theory as a whole isn't. For example, the CKM matrix in QCD can lead to CP violation. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP, isn't a must.

What about CPT symmetry? The SM is CPT symmetric because it's based on a relativistic quantum field theory, and all such theories must respect CPT symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is a must.

Putting it all together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. So the required ones are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). Among the given symmetries:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT operators must respect this symmetry as they are derived from the SM framework. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be preserved.

2. **
