Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. We need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A) 4, B) 8, C) 6, D) 2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is an alkene, so what kind of metathesis would happen here?

3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would imply a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- ... Hmm, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Pentene is five carbons. Position 1 is the start. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe the formula is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, that must be
