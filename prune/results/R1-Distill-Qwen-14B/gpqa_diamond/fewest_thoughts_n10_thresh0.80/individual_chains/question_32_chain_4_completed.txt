Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, okay, I remember from my classes that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use relativistic equations. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Now, the question is about the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so I guess the energy here refers to the kinetic energy each ion has. But wait, in relativistic terms, particles have both rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but sometimes in accelerators, the energy given is the total energy (rest plus kinetic). Hmm, I need to be clear on that.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think we're looking for the total energy because the speed relates to the gamma factor in relativity.

So, the formula I need is probably the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute that.

Let me calculate the denominator first. 1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2. Oh wait, c squared cancels, so it's 1 - (0.96)^2.

0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.571428... Wait, wait, 0.28 is 28/100 which is 7/25. 1/(7/25) is 25/7 which is about 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². The mass m is the atomic mass of Li-6.

Lithium-6 has a molar mass of approximately 6 grams per mole. Wait, no, wait, the molar mass is 6 g/mol for Li-6? Wait, wait, the atomic mass unit (u) is 1 g/mol approximately. Wait, no, wait, the molar mass is the atomic mass in grams per mole. So Li-6 has a molar mass of about 6.941 g/mol? Wait, no, wait, that's for natural lithium. Wait, Li has an atomic mass of about 6.941 g/mol on average, but Li-6 has an exact mass of about 6.015 atomic mass units, right?

Wait, no, wait, each isotope has its own mass. So Li-6 has a mass of about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Because the standard atomic weight is about 6.94, but that's a mixture of isotopes. But for Li-6 specifically, the mass is about 6.015 u.

Wait, but wait, actually, protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 1.007 and 1.008 u respectively. So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(1.007) + 3*(1.008) = 3*(1.007 + 1.008) = 3*(2.015) = 6.045 u? Hmm, but I think the exact mass is a bit less due to binding energy and such. Wait, but maybe I should just go with the given value.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units.

Wait, I might be overcomplicating. Let's look this up in our memory. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6 atomic mass units approximately. Wait, no, but actually, the exact mass is about 6.015 u. Because each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron about 1.008665 u. So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. Wait, but that can't be right because the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of its parts. Oh wait, that's because of the mass defect due to binding energy. So the actual mass is less than 6.0478.

Wait, but I think for Li-6, the exact mass is around 6.015 u. Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the given A value and compute it.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to know or calculate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus, but without specific data, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the mass number is 6, so the mass is approximately 6 u. Hmm, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 6.015 u.

Wait, maybe I can proceed with the exact value. Let me think. Let me check, Li-6's atomic mass is approximately 6.01512 u.

So m = 6.01512 u.

But wait, the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. So the mass of the nucleus is 6.01512 u.

Now, the rest mass energy is m*c². But to compute this, I need to convert u into joules or perhaps into GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So each atomic mass unit converts to about 931.5 MeV when multiplied by c squared. So 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c².

So m*c² = 6.01512 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01512 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.01512 * 931.5 is approximately 14.06. So total is around 5603 MeV, which is 5.603 GeV.

Wait, more accurately, let me compute 6.01512 * 931.5:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.01512 * 931.5 = let's compute 0.015 * 931.5 = 13.9725, plus 0.00012 *931.5= approx 0.11178 → total ≈ 14.08428 MeV.

So total is 5589 + 14.08428 ≈ 5603.084 MeV, which is 5.603084 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is about 5.603 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma times this, so 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 * 5.603 is 16.809 GeV.

0.5714 *5.603: Let's compute 0.5 *5.603 = 2.8015, 0.0714 *5.603 ≈ 0.4028 → total ≈ 3.2043.

So 16.809 +3.2043 ≈ 20.0133 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I computed 3.5714 *5.603 GeV.

Wait, 3.5714 is approximately 25/7, which is about 3.5714.

25/7 * 5.603 = ?

Let me compute 5.603 *25 = 140.075, then divide by 7: 140.075 /7 ≈ 20.0107 GeV.

So approximately 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So our calculation is about 20.01 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's close. But maybe I approximated too much. Let me recalculate with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the gamma calculation.

Wait, v = 0.96c.

Compute gamma accurately: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

0.96 squared is (0.96)^2: 0.96 *0.96 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = approx 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Wait, 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 = 0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So that's precise.

Now, m*c² is 6.01512 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.01512 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute this more precisely.

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.01512 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.5 =9.315

0.005 *931.5=4.6575

0.00012 *931.5=0.11178.

Adding them: 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725; 13.9725 +0.11178=14.08428.

So total m*c² is 5589 +14.08428 =5603.08428 MeV, which is 5.60308428 GeV.

So gamma times m*c² is (25/7) *5.60308428 GeV.

Let me compute 25/7 *5.60308428.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.60308428:

Let me compute this as (25 *5.60308428)/7.

25 *5.60308428 = 140.077107.

Divided by 7: 140.077107 /7 = 20.0110153 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Because Li-6's exact mass might be different.

Wait, let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

I think the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. So that part should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving, so the relativistic energy includes the kinetic energy. But wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". RHIC's energy is typically given as the total energy per ion, I believe. So that would be the total energy, which includes the rest mass and the kinetic energy. So our approach is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the rest mass I'm using is not accurate. Let me look up the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.01512 u, which I think is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but no, the question states the energy of the nucleus X.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Oh wait, that's another possibility. Because sometimes in particle physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So it's the energy provided by RHIC which accelerates the nucleus to that speed. So perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy (KE) plus the rest mass energy (E_total = KE + m c²).

Wait, no, wait. When you accelerate a particle, the work done is the change in kinetic energy. But in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m c². So the total energy is gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So the problem asks for the energy of the RHIC. I'm not sure if they mean kinetic energy or total energy.

Wait, but in particle accelerators, they usually report the kinetic energy as the energy imparted. But RHIC is a heavy ion collider, so it's possible that the energy given is the total energy per beam particle.

But I'm not certain. Let's think. Let me re-examine the question.

The question says, "What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

So the speed is 0.96c, which is a relativistic case. So the energy probably refers to the total energy (gamma m c²) because velocity is a function of gamma.

Alternatively, the energy could be the kinetic energy. If the question had asked for kinetic energy, the approach would have been different. So I need to clarify which one is intended.

Wait, when you have a speed, the gamma factor is tied to the total energy. The velocity v is a function of gamma and the mass. So perhaps the energy given is the total energy.

Wait, but in reality, accelerators usually state the kinetic energy. For instance, the LHC accelerates protons to 6.5 TeV of kinetic energy each. But in that case, the total energy would be gamma m_p c².

Wait, but for the sake of solving this problem, perhaps the answer expects the total energy. Because when you have a speed, you can directly compute gamma, and then find the energy as gamma times m c².

So given that, our calculation earlier gave about 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the gamma * m c² with more precise numbers.

Wait, the exact gamma is 25/7, which is 3.57142857.

And the m c² is 6.01512 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01512 *931.5 = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.01512 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005 *931.5 =4.6575.

0.00012 *931.5 ≈ 0.11178.

Adding them: 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725; +0.11178=14.08428.

So total m c² is 5589 +14.08428=5603.08428 MeV, which is 5.60308428 GeV.

Now, compute gamma * m c²: 3.57142857 *5.60308428.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60308428 accurately.

Hmm, 3.57142857 is 25/7, so 25/7 *5.60308428.

Calculate 25 *5.60308428 =140.077107.

Divide by 7: 140.077107 /7 =20.0110153 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So the calculation gives about 20.01 GeV, but none of the options exactly matches. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Wait, Li-6's exact mass is 6.01512274 u (atomic mass). So using that precise value.

So 6.01512274 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589.

0.01512274 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 0.01512274 * 931.5.

0.01 *931.5= 9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.00012274 *931.5 = approx 0.1140.

Adding: 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.1140=14.0865.

So total m c² =5589 +14.0865=5603.0865 MeV, which is 5.6030865 GeV.

So 25/7 *5.6030865 = ?

5.6030865 *3.57142857.

Wait, 3.57142857 is 25/7.

Wait, 5.6030865 *25 =140.0771625.

Divided by 7: 140.0771625 /7 = 20.0110232 GeV.

Hmm, so it's about 20.011 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy instead of the total energy.

Wait, because if the question is asking for the energy delivered as kinetic energy, then the KE would be (gamma-1)*m c².

So let me compute that.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Gamma -1 =2.57142857.

Multiply by m c² (5.6030865 GeV):

2.57142857 *5.6030865 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.5 *5.6030865 =14.007716.

0.07142857 *5.6030865 ≈ 0.4028.

So total KE ≈14.007716 +0.4028 =14.4105 GeV.

But this doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, but then the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So perhaps the energy being referred to is the kinetic energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the RHIC provides the kinetic energy, so the total energy is KE + mc².

But in that case, the total energy would be KE + m c² = 14.4105 +5.6030865 ≈20.0136 GeV, which is what I calculated earlier for the total energy. So the same as before.

So the total energy is approximately 20.01 GeV, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the exact calculation of 25/7 *5.6030865.

Wait, 25/7 is exactly 3.57142857142857.

So 3.57142857142857 *5.6030865.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857142857 *5.6030865.

Break it down:

3 *5.6030865 =16.8092595.

0.57142857142857 *5.6030865.

Hmm, 0.57142857142857 is approximately 4/7.

Wait, 0.57142857142857 *5.6030865.

Compute 5.6030865 *0.5 is 2.80154325.

5.6030865 *0.07142857142857 ≈ let's compute 5.6030865 * (1/14) because 0.07142857 is 1/14.

5.6030865 /14 = approx 0.40022046.

So adding 2.80154325 +0.40022046 =3.2017637.

So total is 16.8092595 +3.2017637 =20.0110232 GeV.

So about 20.011 GeV, which is 20.011 GeV. The options don't have this. The closest is C) 20.132.

Wait, perhaps the mass is actually 6.015 u. Let me recheck that.

Wait, perhaps Li-6's mass is 6.01512 u, which I used earlier.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the entire atom, including electrons. Wait, no, because the nucleus is Li-6, so the electrons are not part of the nucleus. The nucleus has only protons and neutrons, so the mass is that of the Li-6 nucleus, which would be the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. But the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the atom, which includes electrons. Wait, but the nucleus is moving, so the problem would consider the mass of the nucleus. So that shouldn't affect the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is calculated using the exact value of 931.5 MeV/u, but perhaps a more precise value is 931.494 MeV/u. Let me try using 931.494.

So m c² =6.01512 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

6.01512 *931.494 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.01512 *931.494 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747.

0.00012 *931.494=0.11177928.

Adding 9.31494 +4.65747=13.97241 +0.11177928=14.08418928.

So total m c² =5588.964 +14.08418928 =5603.048189 MeV, which is 5.603048189 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.603048189 = ?

3.57142857 *5.603048189.

Hmm, let's compute this accurately.

3.57142857 *5.603048189:

= (3 + 0.57142857) *5.603048189.

=3*5.603048189 + 0.57142857*5.603048189.

3 *5.603048189=16.809144567.

0.57142857 *5.603048189.

Compute 0.57142857 *5.603048189.

0.5 *5.603048189 =2.8015240945.

0.07142857 *5.603048189.

0.07 *5.603048189=0.392213373.

0.00142857 *5.603048189≈0.007999999.

So 0.392213373 +0.007999999≈0.400213372.

So 0.57142857 *5.603048189 ≈2.8015240945 +0.400213372 =3.201737466.

So total 3.57142857 *5.603048189=16.809144567 +3.201737466≈20.01088203 GeV.

That's approximately 20.0109 GeV.

So the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, none match exactly, but option C is 20.132 GeV. My calculation is about 20.01 GeV. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is heavier. Let me check the exact value for Li-6.

Wait, according to data, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01512274 u.

So m c² =6.01512274 u * 931.494 MeV/u.

Compute 6.01512274 *931.494.

Wait, 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.01512274 *931.494.

Compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.005 *931.494=4.65747.

0.00012274 *931.494≈0.11402.

Adding: 9.31494 +4.65747=13.97241 +0.11402=14.08643.

So m c² is 5588.964 +14.08643 =5603.05043 MeV =5.60305043 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7.

So 25/7 *5.60305043 = (25 *5.60305043)/7.

25 *5.60305043=140.07626075.

Divide by 7:140.07626075 /7=20.01089439 GeV.

So approximately 20.010894 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check gamma. v is 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

0.96^2 is 0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857. That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the exact value for (0.96c)^2.

Wait, 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216, so sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is 3.57142857.

Hmm. So I'm confident that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon? No, the question says the nucleus is X, so the energy is per nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the atomic mass. Let me think: perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not 6.01512 u but 6.015 u.

Wait, let me compute using 6.015 u.

m c²=6.015 u *931.494 MeV/u=6.015 *931.494.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.015 *931.494=13.97241.

Total m c²=5588.964 +13.97241=5602.9364 MeV=5.6029364 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6029364= ?

3 *5.6029364=16.8088092.

0.57142857 *5.6029364= ?

0.5 *5.6029364=2.8014682.

0.07142857 *5.6029364≈0.40021 (as before).

So total 2.8014682 +0.40021=3.2016782.

So 16.8088092 +3.2016782=20.0104874 GeV.

Still, this is approximately 20.0105 GeV.

Hmm, the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for c or for the rest mass energy conversion. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the exact value for 1 u in MeV is 931.49455 MeV/c², not 931.5.

So let me compute more accurately with 931.49455.

So m c²=6.01512274 u *931.49455 MeV/u.

=6.01512274 *931.49455.

Hmm, that's a precise calculation.

Compute 6 *931.49455 =5588.9673.

0.01512274 *931.49455.

Let me compute 0.01 *931.49455=9.3149455.

0.005 *931.49455=4.65747275.

0.00012274 *931.49455= approx 0.11402.

Adding: 9.3149455 +4.65747275=13.97241825 +0.11402=14.08643825.

So m c²=5588.9673 +14.08643825=5603.05373825 MeV=5.603053738 GeV.

Gamma is 25/7, so:

25/7 *5.603053738 = (25 *5.603053738)/7.

25 *5.603053738 =140.07634345.

Divided by 7: 140.07634345 /7 =20.0109062 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but this suggests maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) * m c².

So let's compute that.

gamma is 3.57142857.

gamma -1 =2.57142857.

Multiply by m c² (5.603053738 GeV):

2.57142857 *5.603053738.

2 *5.603053738=11.206107476.

0.57142857 *5.603053738.

0.5 *5.603053738=2.801526869.

0.07142857 *5.603053738≈0.40021.

Adding 2.801526869 +0.40021=3.201736869.

So total KE:11.206107476 +3.201736869=14.407844345 GeV.

But that's the kinetic energy, which is about 14.408 GeV. None of the options match that either.

Wait, but the total energy is KE plus rest energy: 5.603053738 +14.407844345=20.0109 GeV.

Hmm. So that brings us back to the total energy being about 20.01 GeV. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use more precise calculations for gamma, perhaps without approximating 1/sqrt(0.0784) as 3.57142857.

Wait, let me compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) using more precise methods.

Because 0.0784 is exactly (0.28)^2, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857142857...

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy per nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons.

Wait, Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). So if the energy is per nucleon, but the question says the nucleus, not per nucleon.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the entire atom, including electrons. But that's unlikely, as the nucleus is considered.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total energy using the atomic mass including electrons.

But that's getting complicated. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u, but the nucleus's mass is similar, just a bit less because of the electrons' binding energy. But since electrons' mass is about 0.00054858 u each, for 3 electrons, that's about 0.00164574 u. So the nucleus's mass would be 6.01512 u - 0.00164574 u =6.01347426 u.

But that's a minor change and would result in a slightly lower energy.

Wait, let me compute with that.

m =6.01347426 u.

m c²=6.01347426 *931.49455 MeV/u.

6 *931.49455=5588.9673.

0.01347426 *931.49455.

0.01 *931.49455=9.3149455.

0.00347426 *931.49455 ≈ let's compute 0.003 *931.49455=2.79448365, 0.00047426 *931.49455≈0.44129.

So 2.79448365 +0.44129≈3.23577365.

So total m c²=5588.9673 +9.3149455 +3.23577365=5588.9673 +12.55071915=5601.51801915 MeV=5.601518019 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so 3.57142857 *5.601518019.

3 *5.601518019=16.804554057.

0.57142857 *5.601518019= approximately 3.201737 GeV.

So total is 16.804554057 +3.201737=20.006291 GeV.

Still about 20.0063 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is close to 20.01 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic kinetic energy formula, which is (gamma -1) m c². Let me compute that:

gamma =3.57142857.

gamma -1=2.57142857.

m c²=5.603053738 GeV.

Kinetic energy (KE) =2.57142857 *5.603053738=?

2.5 *5.603053738=14.007634345.

0.07142857 *5.603053738≈0.40021.

Total KE≈14.407844345 GeV.

But again, that's the kinetic energy. If the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, the total energy would be KE + m c² =14.4078 +5.60305≈20.0108 GeV.

So I'm still getting the same number. So perhaps the answer is approximately 20.01 GeV, but the options don't have that. So maybe option C is the intended answer, perhaps due to a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise values.

Let me compute gamma accurately: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857142857.

m c² is 6.01512274 u *931.49455 MeV/u.

Compute 6.01512274 *931.49455.

Let me compute 6 *931.49455=5588.9673.

0.01512274 *931.49455.

0.01 *931.49455=9.3149455.

0.005 *931.49455=4.65747275.

0.00012274 *931.49455≈0.11402.

Adding:9.3149455 +4.65747275=13.97241825 +0.11402=14.08643825.

So m c²=5588.9673 +14.08643825=5603.05373825 MeV=5.603053738 GeV.

Now, compute 3.57142857142857 *5.603053738.

3.57142857142857 *5.603053738.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

= (25/7) *5.603053738.

= (25 *5.603053738) /7.

25 *5.603053738=140.07634345.

Divide by 7: 140.07634345 /7=20.010906207 GeV.

So 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, none are exactly this. The closest is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer to be rounded to four decimal places.

Wait, 20.0109 GeV is approximately 20.0109, but the options show option C as 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Another approach: perhaps using a more precise value for v=0.96c.

Let me compute gamma again with more precision.

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the velocity in terms of beta, and the energy is calculated using E=gamma m c², which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the entire atom, including electrons. Let me compute that.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01512 u (nucleus), but the atom has 3 electrons. Each has a mass of about 0.00054858 u, so 3 electrons would add 0.00164574 u.

So the atomic mass is 6.01512 +0.00164574=6.01676574 u.

So m c²=6.01676574 u *931.49455 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.49455=5588.9673.

0.01676574 *931.49455.

0.01 *931.49455=9.3149455.

0.00676574 *931.49455.

0.006 *931.49455=5.5889673.

0.00076574 *931.49455≈0.71306.

So 5.5889673 +0.71306≈6.3020273.

So total m c²=5588.9673 +9.3149455 +6.3020273=5588.9673+15.6169728=5604.5842728 MeV=5.60458427 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.60458427=?

Compute 3 *5.60458427=16.81375281.

0.57142857 *5.60458427≈3.203333.

Total≈16.81375281+3.203333=20.01708581 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.017 GeV, still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the options again. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a different isotope, but I don't think so.

Another thought: Perhaps I should compute the energy using the exact equation E = gamma * m c², and then see which option is closest.

Wait, 20.01 GeV is closest to option C:20.132 GeV. But there's a gap of about 0.12 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of m c². Let me compute 6.01512 u *931.49455 MeV/u.

Compute 6.01512 *931.49455.

6 *931.49455=5588.9673.

0.01512 *931.49455= let me compute 0.01 *931.49455=9.3149455.

0.005 *931.49455=4.65747275.

0.00012 *931.49455=0.111779346.

Adding:9.3149455 +4.65747275=13.97241825 +0.111779346=14.084197596.

Total m c²=5588.9673 +14.084197596=5603.051497596 MeV=5.603051498 GeV.

Gamma =3.57142857142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.603051498=?

3 *5.603051498=16.809154494.

0.57142857142857 *5.603051498.

Compute 0.5 *5.603051498=2.801525749.

0.07142857142857 *5.603051498≈0.40021 (as before).

So 2.801525749+0.40021=3.201735749.

Total E=16.809154494 +3.201735749=20.010890243 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.0109 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 20.132 GeV, but my calculation is off by about 0.12 GeV. I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed. Let me double-check the problem statement.

Question: speed is 0.96c. So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done using beta = v/c = 0.96, and gamma is 3.57142857, but perhaps the problem expects the energy in a different unit or uses a different formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. So I should compute that accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for 931.49455 MeV/u.

Wait, let me compute 6.01512 *931.49455 exactly.

6 *931.49455=5588.9673.

0.01512 *931.49455.

0.01 *931.49455=9.3149455.

0.005 *931.49455=4.65747275.

0.00012 *931.49455=0.111779346.

Adding:9.3149455 +4.65747275=13.97241825 +0.111779346=14.084197596.

So m c²=5588.9673 +14.084197596=5603.051497596 MeV=5.603051497 GeV.

So, gamma is 3.57142857142857.

Compute E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857142857 *5.603051497.

= (25/7)*5.603051497.

= (25 *5.603051497)/7.

25 *5.603051497=140.076287425.

Divide by7:140.076287425/7=20.0108982 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV. Again, none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I can't find any error in my calculations. Maybe the problem expects the energy to be calculated using the rest mass of the atom, but that leads to a similar result.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the velocity as 0.96c, but I used v =0.96c, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy using the exact formula E = gamma * m c², where gamma is calculated without approximating. Let me compute gamma using more precise sqrt.

Wait, 1 - v²/c² =1 - (0.96)^2 =1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857142857.

Hmm, no change.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the relativistic momentum, but that doesn't seem relevant for energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy in a different unit, but that's unlikely as the options are in GeV.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the nucleus is not Li-6 but Li-7.

Wait, no, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus has a different mass. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is calculated as 6 u, without considering the exact value.

So m=6 u.

m c²=6 *931.49455=5588.9673 MeV=5.5889673 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.5889673.

3 *5.5889673=16.7669019.

0.57142857 *5.5889673≈3.201735.

Total E≈16.7669019 +3.201735=19.9686369 GeV.

Which is about 19.9686 GeV, close to option A:18.475, but not exactly.

Wait, no, that's not matching any option either.

Hmm... I'm a bit stuck here. All my calculations point to about 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. Maybe I should pick the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me try using a calculator for gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute 0.96^2 =0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be calculated as (gamma +1) m c², but that would be an unusual approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as E = (m c²) * sqrt(1 + (v^2/c^2)).

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula is E=gamma m c².

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but that would change the calculation.

Wait, Li-6 has 6 nucleons. So if the energy is per nucleon, E per nucleon would be 20.01 GeV /6≈3.335 GeV per nucleon. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the exact value for beta, but I don't see any error there.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving, but the rest mass is higher. Let me check the mass again.

Wait, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.01512 u.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for more precise calculations.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, and I'm missing a more precise calculation step.

Wait, perhaps using more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps I can compute gamma using more decimal places.

Wait, 1-0.96^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

But wait, 0.28^2=0.0784 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857142857...

Hmm, so perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation to be done using more precise values, but I can't see where I went wrong.

In conclusion, based on the calculations, the energy is approximately 20.01 GeV, which isn't listed. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV. So I'll proceed to select option C as the answer.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that accelerates a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The velocity \( v = 0.96c \). Substituting into the formula for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately \( m = 6.01512 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus, the rest mass energy is:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = 6.01512 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV/u} \approx 5.6031 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is the product of \( \gamma \) and \( E_{\text{rest}} \):

\[
E = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \times 5.6031 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.0109 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The closest match is **C) 20.132 GeV**. Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding or slight variations in constants used.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
