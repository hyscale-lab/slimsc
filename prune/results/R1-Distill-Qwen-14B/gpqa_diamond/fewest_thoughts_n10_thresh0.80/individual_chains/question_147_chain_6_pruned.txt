Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about an annihilation process involving protons and antiprotons. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other, producing two positively charged particles and two negatively charged ones. Each A has a mass m_A c² of 300 MeV. The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. The question is asking for the velocity of the particles A.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I remember is that in particle reactions, conservation laws are key. That includes conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate the initial momentum as coming only from the antiproton. Wait, but the proton is part of the initial state too. Wait, wait, no. The proton and antiproton are colliding, but I think in this problem, they're considering the initial setup where the antiproton is moving, and the proton is at rest? Or is the proton moving too? Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest. Because in such annihilation reactions, sometimes they consider one particle at rest and the other moving.

Wait, but the initial state is a proton and an antiproton. If the reaction is p + p̄ → ..., and the antiproton is moving slowly, that suggests that maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. So the initial momentum would just be that of the antiproton. But wait, in reality, in a collider scenario, both particles would have equal and opposite momenta. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which perhaps implies that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with low speed. So in that case, the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

But wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass. So if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial system's total momentum is the momentum of the antiproton. Since the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero.

So, moving on. The initial energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy of the proton (or antiproton) plus the kinetic
