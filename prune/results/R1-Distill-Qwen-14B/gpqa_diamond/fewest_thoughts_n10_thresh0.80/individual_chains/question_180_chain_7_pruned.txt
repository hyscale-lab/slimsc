Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

Alright, so it's about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs, I think. But wait, the problem says they have negligible mass, so maybe that won't matter too much.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is calculated using Coulomb's law. The formula for the potential energy U between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Since the system has multiple charges, I think I need to calculate the potential energy due to all the pairwise interactions. But wait, when you have multiple charges, you have to consider each pair and sum up their contributions. But wait, if the charges are fixed, maybe some of them are in fixed positions. 

Let me think. There are 13 charges. One is fixed at point P. The other 12
