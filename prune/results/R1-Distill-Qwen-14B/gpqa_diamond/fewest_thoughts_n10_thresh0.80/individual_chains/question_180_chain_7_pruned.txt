Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electric potential energy, but let's try to think it through. Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So wait, e is the elementary charge, right? Which is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2e, which would be 3.2 x 10^-19 C.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So I imagine point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are arranged in a sphere around it at a radius of 2 meters each. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, okay. I think the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh wait, but since all the charges are identical and fixed, I can use the formula for electric potential energy between point charges.

So the formula for the electric potential energy of two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all the charges are the same, this should simplify things.

But wait, since the system is isolated, we're considering all the interactions. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair. But because the charges are identical and symmetrically placed, maybe I can find a smarter way than calculating each pair individually.

First, let's clarify the setup. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the central charge. But wait, how about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Since they are all constrained at 2 m from P, it's like they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m. So the distance between any two of them isn't 2 mâ€”each is 2 m from P, but their mutual distance depends on their positions on the sphere.

Wait, but maybe the problem is simplifying things. The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each is 2 m away from P, but how are they arranged? If they
