Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Not too low, but not high either.

First, let's note down what each part is telling us.

1. **Substance X**: Incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope with a higher atomic mass than the standard. Maybe it's something with a common isotope like chlorine-35 versus 37, or something like that.

2. **Reaction with Y**: Violently reacts, releases gas W. W's molecule has same protons and neutrons. That means the atomic mass of W's element would be (protons + neutrons) = 2*protons. So if protons (p) equals neutrons (n), then mass number is 2p. So possible candidates are elements where mass number is even, and p = n. Let's think: O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons would make O-16. But wait, O's neutral molecule would be O2. Alternatively, maybe H2? But H has only 1 proton, 0 neutrons in H1. Hmm, but H2's molecule has 2 atoms each with 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium), but that's more of a gas. Alternatively, maybe CO2? Wait no, because CO2's molecule doesn't have same number of protons and neutrons in each atom. Wait, maybe the molecule's formula is such that each atom has p = n. Let me think of possible elements. Let's list some:

For W's molecule (gas) with same protons and neutrons in each atom:

- H: 1 proton, 0 neutrons? No, because for H, if it's H2 (like H2 gas), each H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So protons in molecule: 2, neutrons: 0. But that doesn't match. Unless it's deuterium, D2. Then each D has 1 proton, 1 neutron. So total protons in molecule: 2, neutrons: 2. So same number. So W could be H2 or D2. But D2 is less common, but maybe. Alternatively, maybe another element.

- Let's think of other elements. Let's see:

An element where protons equal neutrons. So, for example, carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So each atom has p = n. If W is CO2, wait no, because each CO2 molecule has one C and two O. C has 6 p, O has 8 p. That wouldn't fit. Alternatively, maybe W is a molecule where each atom has p = n. So perhaps O2? O has 8 p, 8 n (if O-16). So each O atom has p=8, n=8. So O2 would have
