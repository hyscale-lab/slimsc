Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so adding 4 K would make it 4°C. That's a bit on the higher side for melting points, but maybe it's a solid under normal conditions.

So, let's start by thinking about each part. First, gas W: the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think about common gases. Hydrogen has H2, but each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Helium is He, but that's a noble gas. Wait, maybe CO2? No, CO2 has a different structure. Oh wait, perhaps H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Let me think about the molecular formula where protons and neutrons are equal. Let's say the molecule is something like CH4? No, that's 1 C, 4 H. Maybe it's a molecule with a single atom, like He? No, He-4 has 2 protons (since it's a noble gas) and 2 neutrons. So He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which would make the molecule He. So gas W is helium? But wait, He is a noble gas, not usually reactive. Hmm, but the reaction is violent, so maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility: NH3? No, ammonia has 1 N and 3 H. The number of protons and neutrons in the molecule? Let me think about each atom. For ammonia, each N has 7 protons and maybe 7 neutrons (if it's N-14). Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons: 7 + 3*1 =10. Neutrons: 7 +3*0=7. Doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's O2? O2 has 8 protons each, so two O atoms is 16 protons. Each O-16 has 8 neutrons. So the molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons (since two O atoms, each with 8 neutrons: 2*8=16). So that's 16 each. So O2 would fit. So gas W is O2. But wait, O2 is diatomic, and each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in the molecule. So yes, protons equal to neutrons.

So when X reacts with Y, it releases O2. What could that reaction be? Maybe a decomposition reaction where a peroxide breaks down into O2. Alternatively, maybe a metal reacting with an acid to produce O2? Wait, metals reacting with acids usually produce H2, not O2. Unless it's a very strong oxidizing acid, like conc. HNO3 or H2SO4, but those reactions are more about producing NO or SO2, not O2. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G when heated releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C, so B is a solid at that temperature. What has a melting point near there? Maybe water? Wait, water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is about 4°C. So if B is water, but when heated, it would melt. Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound. Wait, maybe B is something like NaOH, but that's a solid, but melting point is higher. Wait, wait, another thought: maybe B is sodium hydroxide? No, its melting point is around 318 K, I think. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: B is sodium oxide or something else. Alternatively, maybe B is something like Na2O, but I'm not sure about its melting point. Alternatively, think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a hydroxide, and when heated, it decomposes into oxide and water. For example, perhaps G is a metal hydroxide. Let's think: when a hydroxide is heated, it might decompose. For example, NaOH on heating doesn't decompose usually, but maybe in certain conditions. Alternatively, if G is a carbonate, heating could release CO2 and water, but that may not lead to B. Alternatively, if G is a sulfide, but that's not matching with the O2 gas.

Wait, going back. The reaction between X and Y releases O2. So perhaps X is a heavier isotope-containing compound. Let me think about X. The first part says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So the natural isotope is lighter, but X has a heavier one. So perhaps X is something like H2O where one H is deuterium? Or maybe another element with a heavier isotope.

Wait, another thought: If X is a heavy water isotope, like D2O. But then reacting with Y, what would Y be? Maybe a metal like sodium. Sodium reacts with water to produce H2 (not O2), so that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a peroxide, like H2O2. But then, D2O2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Wait, the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Keto acid reacting with X gives a product with 2 O atoms. Hmm. Keto acids are like acetic acid (CH3COOH). So if X is something like NaOH, then the reaction would be neutralization, producing Na acetate, which has O in the acetate ion. Wait, but the product would have more O atoms. Alternatively, if X is something like H2O, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe X is NaOH (sodium hydroxide). Then, when a keto acid like acetic acid reacts with NaOH, it would neutralize to form sodium acetate and water. The product (sodium acetate) has the formula CH3COONa, which has O atoms. Wait, but sodium acetate has acetate (CH3COO-) which has two O's in the COO group. So the product would have two O atoms. Or wait, the product in the reaction of a keto acid with X has 2 O atoms. So maybe the product is something like a carboxylate ion, which has two O's in the COO- group. So X is a base, like NaOH, which reacts with a keto acid (like acetic acid) to form a carboxylate salt. So that fits.

Wait, but X is known to have a heavier isotope. So if X is NaOH, but Na has a natural isotope. Wait, sodium is Na-23 usually, but perhaps X has a heavier isotope, like Na-25? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is not NaOH but another compound.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid and X has 2 O atoms. Let's think of X as something
