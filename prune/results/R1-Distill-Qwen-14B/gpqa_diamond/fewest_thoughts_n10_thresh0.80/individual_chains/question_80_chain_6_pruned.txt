Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes some DNA sequences and outputs numbers. I need to figure out what the value is for the sequence ACAGTGACC based on the examples given. The examples are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176.

Hmm, let's see. The examples might help me figure out the pattern. So, for AGG, the output is 115. AGG is three nucleotides long. TGCTGA is six nucleotides, and the output is 176. I wonder what the algorithm is doing.

Maybe each nucleotide has a certain value, and the algorithm sums them up. Let me check that. Let's take AGG first. If each A, G, and G adds up to 115, then A could be a certain number, G another. Wait, but AGG is three letters, so 3 letters sum to 115. Let me think about possible values for each nucleotide.

Alternatively, maybe it's considering the position of each nucleotide in the sequence. Like, each position contributes a certain value. For example, the first nucleotide contributes a value, the second another, etc. But since the first example has three letters and the second has six, the approach might vary.

Another thought: perhaps each nucleotide is assigned a numerical value, and the algorithm adds the values for each letter in the sequence. Let's assign variables. Letâ€™s say A = a, T = t, C = c, G = g. Then, for the first example:

AGG would be a + g + g = a + 2g = 115.

The second example, TGCTGA, which is T, G, C, T, G, A. So the sum would be t + g + c + t + g + a = 2t + 2g + c + a = 176.

So now I have two equations:
1. a + 2g = 115
2. 2t + 2g + c + a = 176

Hmm, but I have four variables here (a, g, t, c) and only two equations. So that's not enough. Maybe there's another pattern. Wait, maybe it's the product of the individual values instead of the sum. Let me try that.

If AGG's product is 115, then a * g * g = 115. But 115 factors into 5 * 23. So the product of a and g squared is 115. But 5 and 23 are primes, so possible a and g could be 5 and 23, but since they are multiplied as a * g^2, let's check:

If a * g^2 = 115, possible g=5, then a=115/(5^
