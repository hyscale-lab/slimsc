Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, using TLC, they saw that the reactant spot decreased, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the options (A to D) could be the products.

Hmm, I remember that when HBr is used with alkenes, it typically leads to an addition reaction, probably via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. The starting material here has an allyl group attached to an oxygen in a benzene ring. So the structure is an aryl ether with an allyl group. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that structure mentally.

So the benzene ring has an ether oxygen connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl... wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that doesn't make sense for butenyl. Wait, but but has four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the positions are from the end. So the enyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, I think I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH
