Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans.

First, I need to understand the structure of each of these compounds. Let me recall what each looks like. Acetate esters typically have the structure R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, wait. Oh right, the ester group is O-CO-O, but in the case of an acetate, one of the R groups is an acetyl (like OAc is O-CO-CH3). So the structure would be something like CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, wait. No, wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, but for an acetate, it's actually the acetyl group attached to the ester oxygen. So, for example, ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. So the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkyl from the alcohol and R' is the acetyl (CH3CO-).

But in this case, the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but wait, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, maybe the ester is formed from the propenyl or butenyl group. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3 for propenyl acetate, but then the configuration (cis or trans) would refer to the double bond.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The ester group is O-CO-O, and the substituent is the propenyl or butenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3. But wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the ester is more like the propenyl group attached as R-O-CO-R', but with R' being the acetyl group, which is CH3CO-. So the structure would be the propenyl group attached to the oxygen. So, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the oxygen of the ester.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to consider the structure of each option.

Let's list the options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: So the butenyl group is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait. Butenyl is four carbons, with a double bond. So butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH2CH2CH=CH-. Wait, but butenyl could be either 1-propenyl or 2
