Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's think this through. I remember that the potential energy between point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law formula. But wait, since all the charges are the same, maybe I should consider the potential each charge contributes to the others.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is at the center, right?

So, the system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, because each charge is identical and placed symmetrically, maybe there's a formula for the potential energy of a group of point charges.

I remember that for n identical point charges each of charge q, placed at the corners of a regular (n-1)-simplex, the potential energy is something like (n choose 2) times the potential between two charges. But wait, wait. In this case, the setup is a bit different because 12 charges are at the same distance from the 13th.

Wait, maybe I should model this as the 13th charge being fixed at the center, and the other 12 arranged in a sphere around it, each 2 meters away. But no, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, but just that each is at 2 meters from P. So I think the arrangement might not matter because all the 12 are equidistant from P. But perhaps for potential energy calculations, the configuration does matter.

Wait, but since the 12 charges are all at the same distance from the fixed charge, maybe it's easier to compute the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and then compute the potential energy among the 12 themselves.

Ah, right! The total potential energy U of the system would
