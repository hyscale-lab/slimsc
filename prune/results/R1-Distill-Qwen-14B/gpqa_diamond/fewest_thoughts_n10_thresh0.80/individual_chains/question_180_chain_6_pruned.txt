Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy, I think. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh, right, e is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2e, which would be 3.2e-19 C.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. Oh, so the 13th is like at the center, and the other 12 are arranged in a sphere of radius 2 meters around it? Well, maybe not, but their distances from P are 2 m each.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But since it's an isolated system, maybe I don't have to worry about external fields or anything else.

So the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all charges are the same, I can probably calculate the potential between each pair and sum them all up.

But wait, how many pairs are there? Let's see, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so it's interacting with each of the 12 charges. Then the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, but what about their mutual interactions? Do I need to consider the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges as well?

Oh, right, the total electric potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs. So in this case, there are two contributions: the energy due to the 13th charge interacting with each of the 12, and the energy due to the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Let me break it down. First, the energy between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges. Each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, so each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct
