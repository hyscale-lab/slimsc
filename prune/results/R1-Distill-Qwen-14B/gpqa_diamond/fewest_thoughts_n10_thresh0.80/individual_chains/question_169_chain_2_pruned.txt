Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get what's going on.

The question says that there's a nuclear decay where two heavy nucleons of flavor A convert into two of flavor B, and emit two lighter particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The important thing here is that the total energy spectrum of E particles is continuous with some endpoint Q.

Now, there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. The question is how does this change the E particles' total energy spectrum compared to the original decay.

I remember that in radioactive decay processes, the type of particles emitted and their properties affect the energy spectrum of the decay products. In beta decay, for example, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves a transition where energy is shared among particles.

Wait, in the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The E particles' energy spectrum is continuous. That suggests that E and V are probably electrons or positrons or something similar, but more likely, maybe like beta particles. Because in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a range of energies, not just a single value. And there's an endpoint where the maximum energy is determined by the available Q value.

But now in the variant, instead of two V particles, there's one M. And M is massless and exotic. Hmm. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

I'm trying to think how the presence of M affects the spectrum of E particles. Because in the original scenario, there were two V particles. So let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original decay, the system is 2A turning into 2B, 2E, and 2V. The total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since E and V are emitted, their energies and momenta must add up in a way that the initial conditions (rest mass, etc.) are satisfied.

But now, in the variant, we have M. Since M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c (or something like that, but in particle physics units, E=|p| for massless). Also, M is a single particle instead of two Vs.

Wait, but the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So now, the products are 2E, 2B, and M. Since M is massless, perhaps this affects the available energy for the E particles.

In the original decay, each V might have taken some energy. But now, M takes some as well. So if in the original decay, the E's had a continuous spectrum because their energy could vary depending on the V's energies, perhaps in the variant, M's presence modifies the energy distribution.

Wait, but in the original case, the E's had a continuous spectrum. What's causing that? Typically, a continuous spectrum arises when the decay involves a change where the emitted particles can take a range of energies. For example, in beta decay, the
