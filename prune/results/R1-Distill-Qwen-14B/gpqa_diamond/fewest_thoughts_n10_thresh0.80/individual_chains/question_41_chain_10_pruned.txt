Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me think through this step by step.

So the question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light in moving media, it's all about how the medium's motion affects the observed speed of light. Wait, but wait: the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, right? But when the medium itself is moving, how does that impact the observed speed?

Wait, I think this involves the concept of relativistic velocities, but wait, the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. Oh, but the medium is moving at velocity v. So I should consider the Doppler effect or maybe the addition of velocities in special relativity?

Wait, no, maybe not. Let's think about it differently. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at v_light = c/n, but since the glass itself is moving, we have to find the speed as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, same direction. So the beam's direction is towards the observer, and the medium is moving towards the observer.
