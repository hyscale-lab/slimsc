Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from my studies that when objects are moving relative to an observer, their measurements can change according to special relativity. But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's an inertial frame. Oh right, Newtonian mechanics might not apply here because we're dealing with the speed of light, which can't be exceeded.

Wait, the question says the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. So the light is going through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. Hmm, but the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But here, the medium itself is moving.

In Newtonian physics, if the medium is moving, you just add the velocities. So if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n, then from the lab frame, the speed would be v_light + v. But wait, no, because the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the light's speed relative to the lab would be v_light + v? Or is it something else?

Wait, but this is a tricky question because in reality, the speed of light is always c in vacuum, but in a medium, it's c/n. But
