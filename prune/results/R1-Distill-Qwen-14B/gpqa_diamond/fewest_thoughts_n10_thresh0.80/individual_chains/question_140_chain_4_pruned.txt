Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, the question is about Substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. There's also another part involving a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Let's break this down.

First, the melting point of B is near 277 K. Hmm, what's that temperature in Celsius? 277 K minus 273 is about 4 degrees, so melting point around 4°C. I remember that water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C, so 4°C is close to the melting point of something else. Wait, maybe B is ammonium chloride? No, ammonium chloride's melting point is around 334 K, which is higher. Or maybe B is something like ice? No, ice melts at 0°C. Alternatively, what about sodium hydroxide? No, that's way higher. Oh wait, I think I might be mixing this up. Let me think differently.

The reaction of X with Y gives a precipitate G. G, when heated, releases B. So maybe G is something that decomposes upon heating. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating might release CO2. Or if G is a nitrate, maybe it decomposes into something else. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating might release water or something else.

Wait, the gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So the gas is probably CO2 or maybe even something else. Let me think about the possible gases. For example, CO2 has 12 (C) protons and 16 (O) *2, but that's 16*2=32 for O, but wait, that's the mass. Wait, no: the number of protons is 6 for C and 8 each for O. So CO2 would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons would be (mass number - protons). For ^12C, 6 neutrons; for ^16O, 8 each. So CO2 would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons, and 6 + 8*2 = 22 neutrons. Oh, wait, 12C has 6 neutrons, 16O has 8. So each O has 8 neutrons. So for CO2, total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh, that matches the condition. So gas W is CO2.

So, when X reacts with Y, CO2 is released. What reactions produce CO2? Common ones are reactions with carbonate, bicarbonate, or maybe a carboxylic acid with a strong base. Or maybe a reaction between a metal and an acid, but that usually produces H2. Wait, in this case, if Y is a liquid, perhaps water? No, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4, and X is a carbonate. So, X + H2SO4 → CO2 gas plus a sulfate precipitate, maybe. Or perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate salt. But let me think about the precipitate G.

If X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, then G could be a metal hydroxide precipitate if Y is a metal salt. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal nitrate and Y is something else. Wait, maybe X is a metal carbonate, Y is an acid (like HCl), which would produce CO2, and the precipitate would be a metal chloride. Wait, but metals don't precipitate as hydroxides here; perhaps it's a sulfide or something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal sulfite, and Y is an acid, which would produce SO2 gas. But earlier we thought W is CO2. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, the product of a keto acid (like a beta-keto acid) reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. So, what's a keto acid? For example, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid, but a keto acid would have a ketone group adjacent to the carboxylic acid, like acetoacetic acid. When such a keto acid reacts with X, maybe it's undergoing a reaction like decarboxylation, where a CO2 is released. But wait, the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe it's something like the formation of an ester or an acid chloride.

Alternatively, if X is an acid chloride, like thionyl chloride (SOCl2), then reacting a carboxylic acid with SOCl2 would produce an acid chloride, but
