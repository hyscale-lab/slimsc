Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's look at the metric given. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. But wait, a pseudosphere usually is a 2D surface, so this makes sense.

I remember that the metric can be written in terms of a line element, and the area element involves the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Oh right, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

So the metric here is diagonal, with components g_xx and g_yy both equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant should be (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, because determinant for a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Taking the square root of g gives sqrt(g) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Now,
