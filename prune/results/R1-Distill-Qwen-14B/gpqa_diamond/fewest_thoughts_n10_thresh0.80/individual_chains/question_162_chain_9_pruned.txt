Okay, so I have this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that metrics are used in general relativity and differential geometry to describe the curvature of space. The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). 

Wait, the question asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbolic version of a sphere. But wait, the term "radius" here might be a bit tricky because in hyperbolic geometry, the concept of radius is different. 

So the metric they've given is in terms of x and y. Let me see. The metric looks like it's in two dimensions because it's dx² and dy². So it's a 2D space. The general form of a metric in 2D can be written as ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). Here, g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait a second, this reminds me of the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk is a model of hyperbolic space where the metric is given by ds² = 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²). But our metric here is different. Let me compare. 

In our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²) and the numerator is 32. So the metric is ds² = [
