Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars... right, they orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me read the question again. Both systems exhibit eclipses; the periods are 2 years and 1 year for system_1 and system_2. So the orbital periods are 2 and 1 years respectively. Then, the radial velocity (RV) variations are given. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, 15 and 10 km/s. Wait, RV amplitude refers to the speed at which the stars are moving towards or away from us, right?

I remember that in binary systems, the more massive star has a smaller orbit. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the less massive star would have a larger orbit, meaning it moves faster. Oh wait, so the velocity amplitude is higher for the less massive star. 

So, the amplitude of the velocity measured is directly related to the mass of the other star. Because in the center of mass system, m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. The velocity v is proportional to the orbital circumference over the period. So v = (2πa)/P. Since a = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * a_total, where a_total is the separation. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of velocity amplitude ratios.

Wait, in a spectroscopic binary, both stars orbit the common center of mass. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for each star is given by the same formula. The formula for K is (v is the velocity amplitude of the star):

K = ( (2π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for both stars in the system, the ratio of their velocity amplitudes is inversely proportional to their masses. Because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. That's because the center of mass requires m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, and
