Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in a quantum system. Hmm, let me try to untangle what's going on.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of the operator P_z in a given state. I remember that the formula for the uncertainty is the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Wait, no, actually the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So that must be the state vector ψ. 

The operator P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write that down. P_z is a 3x3 matrix:

[ ħ    0     0 ]
[ 0    0     0 ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

So the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. That makes sense because in such a basis, the matrix is diagonal. So the eigenvectors are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩, probably.

The state ψ is given as the column vector (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2). Wait, let me check the dimensions. Each component is a scalar. So the state is a 3-component vector, meaning it's a 3-level system. 

Since we need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩ for the state ψ.

Wait, but first, let me make sure I get the state correctly. The vector ψ is a column, so it's [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]. Let me double-check the components. The first component is -1/2, the second is 1/sqrt(2), the third is -1/2. 

Wait a second, I should verify if this state is normalized. Let's compute the norm. The sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

Compute |(-1/2)|^2 + |1/√2|^2 + |
