Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves two reactions, and then analyzing the products using HPLC. The problem is about determining how many peaks each chromatogram will show. Let's go through each reaction one by one.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. So when LAH reduces it, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. The structure would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) configuration. Let me think about the reduction process. When a ketone is reduced, the configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the starting material's configuration. Wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is a ketone. So when LAH reduces the ketone to an alcohol, the resulting molecule would have an alcohol group at C3. The stereochemistry at C3 would be R or S? Hmm, wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at which carbon? Wait, no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the configuration is at the 5 position? Or wait, the molecule is 5-methoxy, so the methoxy is on C5. The ketone is on C3, which is the carbonyl group. So when it's reduced, the C3 becomes a CHOH group. So the molecule would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, and the configuration at C3 would be determined by the reduction. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used in a protic environment. When a ketone is reduced with LAH, the resulting alcohol is R or S? The ketone is planar, so the reduction can lead to a racemic mixture. But wait, wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer, (S)-configured. Wait, no, the starting material has the configuration at which carbon? Let me draw the structure.

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the carbonyl is on C3. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Let me count the carbons correctly. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But in this case, the substituent is a methoxy at C5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, perhaps I should number the carbons. Hexan-3-one: positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, 5-methoxy group is on C5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3 at C5? Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-
