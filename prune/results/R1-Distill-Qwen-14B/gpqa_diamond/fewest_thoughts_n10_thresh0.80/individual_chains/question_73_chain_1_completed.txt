Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that relativistic mechanics are a bit tricky, so I'll need to think carefully.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options given are for the relative speed (v_rel) and the total energy E.

First, I think about relative speed in relativity. I remember that you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, because both are moving in the same direction, so u is the speed of the second astronaut relative to the first? Or wait, no, because from the perspective of one astronaut, the other is approaching, so their relative speed would be in the same direction. Let me clarify.

Wait, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So if Astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and Astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's frame, how fast is B moving? Well, wait, no. Wait, no, because in the problem statement, are they in the same inertial frame? No, each is moving in their own frame. So to find the relative speed between them, we have to calculate how fast one sees the other moving.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. If both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds, then the relative speed from the perspective of the faster astronaut would be the difference, but only if you use the relativistic formula.

Wait, no. Let's get this straight. The velocity addition formula is used when you have two objects moving at speeds u and v relative to a common frame (like the lab frame). So to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, which is moving at speed u_A (0.6c) relative to the lab frame. So the speed of B in A's frame would be (v_B - u_A)/(1 - (v_B u_A)/c²).

Wait, but wait, the problem asks for the relative speed between the two. So if A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then in A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is (0.5 -0.6 )c = (-0.1)c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 -0.3=0.7.

So the relative speed is (-0.1 c)/0.7 = approx -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're talking about speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a possibility.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, in this context, when the problem says 'total energy of the system', I think it refers to the sum of their relativistic energies from the perspective of the rest frame where both are moving, perhaps the lab frame.

So each astronaut's energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each, compute their gamma factor.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) =1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is 3m * 1.1547 c² = around 3 * 1.1547 m c² = 3.4641 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Which approximately rounds to 5.96 m c². So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c² and v_rel=0.14c. That seems to fit.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the problem says 'the total energy of the system'. I think in relativity, when you have multiple objects, the total energy is the sum of their energies in the same frame. So if we're considering the lab frame, which is the rest frame, each astronaut's energy is their gamma times mc² (for their respective masses). So adding their energies gives the total energy in that frame.

Alternatively, if the system's rest frame is different, but that's more complicated. But I think the question is straightforward, just summing their energies as measured in the lab frame.

Looking back at the options: option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc², which matches our calculations. Option D has E=5 mc², which is 5, but our calculation is 5.96, so option C is correct.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed and the total energy of the system consisting of two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Here's the analysis:

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \(v_A = 0.6c\) (speed of the first astronaut),
- \(v_B = 0.5c\) (speed of the second astronaut).

Substituting the values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts, calculated as:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\),
- Speed = \(0.6c\),
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\),
- Speed = \(0.5c\),
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
