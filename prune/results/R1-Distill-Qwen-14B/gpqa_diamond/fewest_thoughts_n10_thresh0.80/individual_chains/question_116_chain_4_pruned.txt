Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, Compound A undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form Compound C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce Compound D. I need to identify Compound D from the given options.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I'll start by figuring out what Compound A is based on its NMR. The NMR data: triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. These are likely to be alkyl groups. The triplet suggests that each of those 6H is next to a CH2 group, maybe. Wait, wait. Let me think. In NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet for a CH3 group would imply that each of the CH3 protons is adjacent to a CH2 group (since two neighboring protons would split into a triplet). Alternatively, maybe the 6H are in two equivalent CH3 groups, each adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, 6H as a triplet suggests that these are two equivalent CH3 groups, each adjacent to a CH2. So for example, perhaps a diethyl group. Let me think: ethyl groups. If we have two ethyl groups, the CH3 would be a triplet because they're adjacent to the CH2. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H would correspond to the CH2 groups in each ethyl. Because each CH2 in an ethyl group is next to another CH2, the splitting would be a quartet. Wait, no, each CH2 in an ethyl is next to another CH2, but the splitting would be a quartet for each group? Or maybe the ethyl groups are in a symmetrical structure.

Wait, let's think about the ethyl groups. Suppose Compound A is diethyl ether (but wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3). The protons on the CH3 groups would be a triplet because each is adjacent to the CH2. The CH2 groups would split into a quartet since each is next to the O and another CH2. Wait, but diethyl ether's NMR: the CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2 ppm, and the CH2 would be a quartet around 3.5 ppm. Oh wait, but in the question, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm. So that's lower, so maybe not diethyl ether.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound A is something like neopentane
