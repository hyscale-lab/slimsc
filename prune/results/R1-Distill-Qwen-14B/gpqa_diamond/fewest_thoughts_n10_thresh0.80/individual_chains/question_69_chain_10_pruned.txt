Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X^0 decays into Y^+ and Z^-. The proper lifetime of X^0 is tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different values in meters.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with particle decay and detection, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to account for time dilation due to special relativity. So the observed lifetime tau would be gamma multiplied by tau_0.

The first thing I need to find is the gamma factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, given by gamma = E/mc². Wait, since energy E is given, which is 27 GeV, and mass m is 3.41 GeV, that should work. Because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, in natural units where c=1, it's E = gamma m, so gamma = E/m. So here, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 8 is about 27.28. So 27 / 3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let me check that more accurately. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28. So 27-27.28 is negative, so maybe gamma is about 7.91?

So gamma is approximately 7.91. That means the lifetime observed, tau, is gamma multiplied by tau_0. So tau = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8e-16 *7.91 is approximately 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but what's the purpose of this? I think the next step is to find the length over which the decay occurs, which is the particle's speed multiplied by the lifetime. Because when the particle is moving, it travels a certain distance before decaying. The minimum resolution of the detector should be able to resolve this length so that we can see the decay products.

So the length L is gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Wait, because L = v * tau, and v = beta c. So yes, L = beta gamma c tau_0. But wait, since tau is gamma tau_0, and v=beta c, so
