Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to get product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to give product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each step.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone + bromine. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When you add bromine (Br2) to a ketone, I think it's a bromination reaction. Wait, maybe it's a dibromination because ketones can undergo some addition reactions. Or wait, another possibility is that the ketone is undergoing a ring-opening if it's a cyclic ketone. Wait, no, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Oh wait, I remember! When a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it undergoes a ring-opening reaction. Specifically, the cyclohexanone can undergo a halohydrin formation. So, the bromine adds across the carbonyl group. So, the product would have an -OH and a Br added. So, product 1 would be 1-bromo-1-hydroxycyclohexane. Wait, wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substitution. Let me think again. Oh, wait, another possibility. Oh, wait, no, it's more likely an addition across the carbonyl. So the ketone becomes a vicinal dihalide, but wait, no, because bromine is a dienophile sometimes, but in this case, I think it's an addition. So, cyclohexanone (which is a six-membered ring with a carbonyl group) treated with Br2 in a non-polar solvent would lead to the formation of a bromo alcohol. Wait, isn't that the case when adding bromine to a ketone in a solvent like dichloromethane? Oh, right, I think when ketones react with bromine, it's a bromohydrin formation
