Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That probably means the usual blackbody radiation stuff applies.

I remember that in LTE, the population of energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula for the number of particles in a particular energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. 

So for two different stars, star_1 and star_2, the ratio of the populations of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) would depend on their temperatures. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Let me model this.

Let’s denote the energy levels. Let’s say the lower level is E1 and the upper level is E2. But wait, the energy difference between the considered levels is given. So the energy difference ΔE is E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. 

The population ratio for each star would be (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)) for each star. Or wait, actually, the ratio is (upper)/(lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). 

Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), assuming E_j is lower. So if E2 is higher than E1, then for each star, the ratio is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But in the problem, it says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio. Wait, no, wait. The question says that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So if the ratio in star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

So, let me set up the equations. Let’s let r1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1, and r2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2.

According to the problem, r1 = 2 * r2.

But according to Boltzmann, r = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So,

r1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, substituting into r1 = 2 r2,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE)/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange this equation. 

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) term to the left and the ln(2) to the right:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k) out:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2 )

Wait, because:

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) * something? Let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1.

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 -
