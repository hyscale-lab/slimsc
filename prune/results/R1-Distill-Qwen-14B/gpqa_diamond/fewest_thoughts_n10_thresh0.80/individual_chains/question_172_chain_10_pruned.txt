Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to break this down. I remember that in stars, especially the photosphere, the atoms are in a state of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means that the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to the temperature. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, here n_i is the number of atoms in the excited state, and n_j is the ground state, I think. Or maybe it's the ratio between the excited and another state. But in any case, the ratio depends on the exponent involving the energy difference and temperature.

Given that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So, let's define the ratio for each star:

For star_1: n1 (excited) / n1 (ground) = 2 * (n2 (excited) / n2 (ground)).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation ratio (like, the number in the higher level compared to the lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

So, the ratio (n_i / n_j) for star_1 is 2 times that for star_2.

So, (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j).

But according to the Boltzmann distribution, each of these ratios depends exponentially on the energy difference and temperature. The formula is:

(n_i / n_j) = exp( -(Î”E) / (k T) )

Wait, wait. Wait, actually, the energy difference is E_i - E_j. So if the excited state is higher, E_i > E_j, so the exponent is negative.

Wait, the formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So for star_1,
