Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, each treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The options are about how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA typically forms an epoxide. Since mCPBA is a peracid, it adds across the double bond in an electrophilic addition.

Wait, but the stereochemistry of the starting alkene matters here. For each diastereomer, the epoxidation would give different products. Let me think about how the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. (E) configuration means the higher priority groups on each carbon are on opposite sides. Epoxidation would form an epoxide, and since mCPBA adds a specific stereochemistry, it would lead to a trans epoxide, right? Or wait, no, mCPBA tends to form an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Wait, no, wait. When you epoxidize a trans (E) alkene, the resulting epoxide would have the oxygen atoms in a certain configuration.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this out mentally. For an (E) alkene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. Or is it cis? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that epoxidation via mCPBA follows the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So if the starting alkene is E, the resulting epoxide will have the same configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism
