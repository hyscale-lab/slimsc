Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are four steps in the reaction, and there are some hints provided. I also have multiple-choice options to choose from. 

Alright, let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to give compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Then, the hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are A to D, each a cyclic ketone.

I think I should start by analyzing each step and see what kind of transformations are happening.

Let me think about each step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, HCN would add to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. Wait, but if A is an aldehyde, HCN would form a cyanohydrin as well. Alternatively, if A is something else, like an ester, HCN could react differently. Wait, but the IR of A shows a peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So A is likely a ketone or maybe an ester or aldehyde. But for a ketone, the peak is usually around 1715-1740 cm^-1. Hmm, but wait, 1750 might suggest maybe an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Or perhaps a carbonyl with electron-withdrawing groups. Alternatively, maybe A is an acyl chloride? But the reaction with HCN could be different. Wait, but in the IR, a strong peak at 1750 cm^-1 is more indicative of an ester or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes are around 1720-1700, but conjugated could be higher. Alternatively, maybe a ketone with a strong EWG, but I'm not sure.

But let's think about the structure. If A is a cyclic ketone, then reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group adjacent. 

Then, step 2: B is hydrogenated (H2 and Pd) to form C. Since B is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile. Wait, hydrogenation of nitriles with H2 and Pd would typically reduce the nitrile to an amine. Wait, no, wait: hydrogenation of nitriles (RCN) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically convert the nitrile to an amine (RCH2NH2?), but wait, no, maybe it's reduced to a primary amine. Wait, but if it's a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group, and we're using H2 with Pd, perhaps the nitrile is being hydrogenated. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the Pd is doing something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogenation of the double bond if B has a double bond. Wait, but wait: in the first reaction, adding HCN to a ketone would form a secondary alcohol and a cyanide group. So B would have an OH group and a CN group.
