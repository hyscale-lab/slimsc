Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can do.

Alright, the question provides the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 are strong. Hmm. The 1700 cm^-1 area typically corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). So that could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower, which sometimes is seen in conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. But wait, another thought: the 1650 could be an amide's C=O stretch, but I don't see any info about NMR peaks related to amines, so maybe not.

Then the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests there's an alkene in the compound. So, the structure probably has both a carbonyl group and a double bond. Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester, perhaps?

Now the mass spectrum: a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think what that could be. Common fragments at 45... Maybe a ketene group (CO+) would be 28, but 45 is higher. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something like (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 2*12 +6*1 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, no, wait: 12*2 is 24, 3*1 is 3, 16 for O. So 24+3=27, +16=43. Hmm, not 45. Or maybe a fragment like CH2COOH would give a certain mass?

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula possibilities are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let me calculate the molecular weight for each.

C6H12O: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 16=16. Total 72+12+16=100.
C6H10O: 6*12=72, 10=10, 16=16. 72+26=98.
C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32= 114? Hmm, no: 6*12=72, 10 H is 10, 2 O is 32. 72+10=82+32=114. Wait, no, wait: 72 +10 +32 = 114? Yes.

Wait, wait, C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12 H is 12, 2 O is 32. 72+12=84 +32=116.

Wait, but the mass spectrum shows a peak at 45. So, possible fragments would correspond.

Let me think about possible fragments. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be 114. But a fragment at 45 could be part of that. Alternatively, maybe a smaller group.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at 45 could be a CH2CH2 group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula has a group that, when broken off, leaves a fragment with m/z 45.

Wait, maybe it's a methyl ester group? Or perhaps a ketone fragment.

Alternatively, think about common fragments. The CH3CO+ ion is 43 (since 12+12 +16=40? No, wait: CH3CO+ would be (12*2)+(1*4) +16= 24+4+16=44. Hmm, but that's 44, not 45. So not that.

Wait, another fragment: maybe a (CH2)2O group would be 44 (12*2 + 2*2 +16=24 +4 +16=44). Hmm, but that's 44, not 45.

Wait, what about a fragment with COO as part of it? Let's see: the molecular formula for a fragment like C3H6O2 would be (3*12)+(6)+(32) =36 +6 +32=74. That's too big. Or maybe a smaller fragment.

Wait, maybe it's the loss of something. For example, in an ester, the cleavage might produce a fragment. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester, maybe it breaks into an acylium ion.

Wait, perhaps a more straightforward approach. Let me think about each possible option and see which fits the data.

Let's list the options and their possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures include esters or ketones with an alcohol group, but it's difficult to say. But considering the IR data: broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 could be from an -OH group (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid), but the presence of a carbonyl at 1700 and 1650.

Wait, another thought: the two carbonyl peaks could be from conjugated carbonyl groups. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. The carbonyl in such a structure might show two peaks due to conjugation, but I'm not sure if that's exactly why there are two peaks.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

Mass spec: fragment at 45.

Let me think about each option's possible structure and if any of them would have a fragment of 45.

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is present. So maybe a ring and a double bond.

But the IR shows a broad peak, maybe an alcohol group. So structure could be a cyclohexene with an alcohol group, but then the carbonyl peaks wouldn't fit. Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. But the compound has a double bond (from NMR) and maybe an ester group (which is
