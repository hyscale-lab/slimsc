Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light (wavelength λ) is falling vertically along the z-axis. In the far field, it creates intensity maxima and minima. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. They also mention that the related angles are small, so we can approximate tanθ as θ.

Hmm. So I think this is a diffraction problem, specifically dealing with a circular aperture, but wait, the aperture here is a polygon. But when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? So maybe the problem simplifies to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture when N is very large.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The polygon has all apothems of the same length. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem. Because in a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius R of the circumscribed circle. For a regular polygon, R = a / cos(π/N), right? So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So the polygon turns into a circle of radius a.

So in that case, the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait. Then the formula for the minima in circular aperture diffraction comes into play. The minima occur at angles θ where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first minima is at the first zero of J1. I remember that the first minimum of the single-slit diffraction (which is a different setup) is at λ/(a) * something, but for a circular aperture, it's a bit different.

Wait, no. Single-slit and circular diffraction are different. For a circular aperture, the first minimum isn't at the same position as the single slit. Let me think. The intensity pattern for circular apertures is given by the Bessel functions, specifically the
