Okay, so I've got this physics problem about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field, with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The options give different relations between these two terms. 

First, let's understand what the paramagnetic coupling term is. I remember that in the presence of a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian for the system includes a term due to the magnetic interaction. For an electron in a magnetic field, the energy is given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and S is the spin operator.

Wait, but wait—since the magnetic field is along the Oz axis (so z-direction), the spin component will be along z. So the expectation value <H> would be the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So <H> = -g μ_B <S_z> B. But since we're considering expectation values, and S_z is related to the magnetic quantum number m. Oh right, S_z = ħ m, so <S_z> = m ħ. Therefore, <H> = -g μ_B m ħ B. Or wait, maybe I should check the exact expression. Oh, right, the expectation value of S_z for a state with quantum number m is mħ. So putting that together, <H> = -g μ_B m ħ B. Hmm, but wait, I think another way to write it is μ_B = eħ/(2m_e), so maybe it's better to express everything in terms of known constants.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given for the hydrogen atom. The wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think corresponds to the Balmer series, specifically the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, that's 486 nm (since 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, so 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm). Wait, the Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm, so 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer-beta line, I think. Or perhaps it's the transition from n=3 to n=1, which gives H gamma line at about 486 nm. Right, so ΔE corresponds to this energy.

Recall that the energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (μ_e e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 h^2) * 1/(n^2), but more commonly written as E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for the transition that corresponds to λ=486 nm, we can find the energy difference.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to compute ΔE using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So since λ is given as 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. Let me compute that:

h is Planck's constant ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s

c is speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 4.087e-19 J.

Wait, but let's compute that more accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
c = 299,792,458 m/s

So E = hc/(lambda) = (6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8) / (0.4861e-6 m) 

Compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 2.99792e8 ≈ 1.98645e-25 J·m

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.98645e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.085e-19 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 4.085e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait—Hydrogen's energy levels are negative, so the transition energy ΔE would be the difference between two energy levels. For example, the transition from n=2 to n=1 gives a photon of energy 10.2 eV (since E2 is -3.4 eV and E1 is -13.6 eV, so ΔE = 10.2 eV). But wait, the wavelength given here corresponds to about 2.55 eV, which can't be from a single transition in hydrogen because the transitions are much larger than that. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the energy. Let me double-check.

Wait, the energy E = hc/lambda. Let me compute that again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·
