Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, would take it to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, so the molecule is currently in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state with the lowest possible energy might be the first excited state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on how that applies here.

The problem gives me the masses of the two atoms, X and Y. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. Oh, right, amu stands for atomic mass unit. And the bond length R is 2 angstroms. Also, the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. So, angular frequency is given.

The options are all different momenta values. I need to find which one corresponds to the photon's momentum needed for the transition.

Wait, I remember that when a photon is absorbed, the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the states. So, the photon's energy E_photon = E_final - E_initial. But since the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next state would be the first excited state. So, the energy difference is the energy of the first excited state minus the ground state.

But how do I calculate the energy levels in this model? For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are treated quantum mechanically. Oh right, the quantum rotation-vibration model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states.

Wait, but I think the problem is about the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So, in the ground state, both rotation and vibration are in their lowest quantum numbers. The next state with the lowest energy would likely be the next vibrational state, or perhaps the next rotational state.

Alternatively, the molecule could transition from the ground state to a higher rotational state without changing the vibrational state, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a combination of both.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the next state would be the one with the least energy higher than the current state. So, which transition gives
