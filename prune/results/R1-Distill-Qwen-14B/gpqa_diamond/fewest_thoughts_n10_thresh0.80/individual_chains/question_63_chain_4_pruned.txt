Hmm, okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in such models, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the state with the lowest energy, which is the ground state. The next state would involve either a vibrational or rotational transition, but I think in the case of the non-rigid rotor model, we're considering both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the question specifies the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the combination of the lowest rotational and vibrational states. So that would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0).

The molecule absorbs a photon, which makes it move to the next state. The next lowest energy state after the fundamental state—so what's that? I'm a bit confused here. Do we increase the vibrational state first or the rotational state first? Because in some models, the vibrational energy can change in steps, and the rotational can also change. Oh wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational states are quantized, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length can vary, so it's treated as a vibration as well.

But in general, the energy levels for vibration and rotation are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency, and v is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number.

So the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which would be (v=0, J=0). The next possible state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which one has lower energy? I need to compare the energy of these two states.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = (h^2)/(8 π^2 I), where I is the moment of inertia.
