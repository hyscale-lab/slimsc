Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I need to figure out which of the given compounds show it. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they have non-superimposable mirror images. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. Alternatively, compounds can have other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes or some aromatic systems, but I think the main focus here is on chiral centers.

Let's look at the options one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   Hmm, this sounds a bit complex. So it's a biphenyl compound with substituents at positions 2,2' and 6,6'. The substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. I'm trying to imagine the structure. Each biphenyl ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Wait, but the rings are connected at 1 and 1', right? So the substituents are on opposite sides?

   I think about whether the molecule is symmetrical. If the nitro groups are on the same side or opposite. Wait, the positions are 6 and 6' â€” so on each ring, the nitro is at a para position relative to the connecting point. So each ring has a nitro in the meta position relative to the carboxylate?

   Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then maybe it has a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry.

   Wait, but the substituents are on each ring. Let's think about the biphenyl structure. If the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Are these positions creating any chirality?

   Alternatively, maybe the central biphenyl is connected in such a way that the substituents are on opposite sides, leading to a plane of symmetry. Or perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to check other options first.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   That's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2COOH. Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When it's an ester, like methyl ester, it would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

   Looking at the structure: the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to OH, CH3, COOCH3, and another CH2? Wait, no. Let me draw it out in my head. The structure is:

   O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3
   |
   C(OH)(CH3)

   Wait no, the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Is that correct? Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3. No, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2COHCOOCH3? Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? So the structure is:

   O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3
   |
   C(OH)(CH3)CH2-

   Wait, no, the structure is O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3 is the ester group. The central carbon is CH(OH) connected to CH3 and another CH2 group? Or maybe the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH(OH) connected to COOCH3, CH3, and another CH2? No, wait, propanoate is three carbons: CH2-CH2-COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that's a straight chain. So the central carbon is CH2 with OH, CH2COOCH3, and maybe another CH3? Or is it a different arrangement?

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3. No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate if it's (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, but that's actually 2-hydroxypropanoate as in a branched structure.

   Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the actual structure. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would replace a hydrogen on the second carbon. So it's CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

   So the structure is:

   O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3
   |
   C(OH)(CH3)

   Wait, that's only three carbons. So the central carbon is connected to OH, CH
