Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the scenario is that there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. They've built a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years, so their lifespan is pretty long by our standards. They're sending an astronaut who's 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for him to reach Earth from their perspective, but wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's own perspective, right? Because it says "from the point of view of the astronaut."

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, which is just shy of the speed of light. The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud... I think the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So, from Earth's perspective, how long would the trip take? Let me calculate that first.

So, the distance is about 160,000 light-years. If the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, then the time taken from Earth's frame of reference would be distance divided by speed. Let's compute that.

Time_earth = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since 1 light-year at c is 1 year, so the time would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ let's see, 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so the time is about 160,000 years. Wait, that's a long time from Earth's perspective. But wait, the astronaut's time would be different due to time dilation.

Wait, but the question is asking the astronaut's experienced time. So, we need to compute the proper time, which is the time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is shorter than the coordinate time (Earth's time) because of time dilation.

The formula for time dilation is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that. So, v is 0.99999987c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2.

Calculating 0.99999987 squared: let's see, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6. So squaring that would be approximately (1 - 2*(1.3e-6)) because (1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a for small a. So that would be 1 - 2.6e-6. So 1 - 0.0000026 ≈
