Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both are in circular orbits. 

So, planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period of the planet?

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet. But wait, I might need a more precise formula here.

The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) )^(1/3) but wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)). Because Kepler's third law comes into play here.

Since the two stars have the same mass (same as Sun) and the planets have similar masses, and sin i would be the same if both are edge-on (which isn't stated, but maybe we can assume they have the same inclination for simplicity, though the problem doesn't specify). Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require considering sin i because it's the same for both, so it will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, the formula for K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) ) ) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should look at the formula in terms of the star's velocity. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude can be approximated as K ≈ (v) = ( (G * M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, maybe it's better to go back to Kepler's third law. The period P is determined by (P^2) = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) ) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis. But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (sun-like star and Neptune mass planet), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So P² ≈ (4π² a³ )/( G M_star )

And the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K ≈ (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let me double-check the formula for K. I think the correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) )

Hmm, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, I remember K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. 

Another approach: since the question is about the ratio of the periods, maybe I can express the ratio P2/P1 in terms of the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes K2/K1.

Wait, the problem states that planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstrom, and planet #2's shift is 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is 7? Or wait, the shift is in wavelength, which relates to velocity via the Doppler effect.

The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, where c is speed of light. So the velocity v is approximately (Δλ/λ) * c.

Wait, but in the radial velocity method, it's the velocity of the star that's measured. So K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So K is directly the velocity, which causes the spectral line shift. So if the shift is 5 milliangstrom for planet #1, then K1 is proportional to 5. Similarly, K2 is proportional to 7.

Wait, but the exact formula for K is important here. Let me get the correct formula.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (2π G ) / (P (1 - e²)) ) ]^(1/3) ) / (c) ?

Wait, maybe not. Let's try to find the formula correctly.

The correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (2π / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ?

No, perhaps I should look it up in my notes. Alternatively, the formula I recall is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, another approach: since in the radial velocity method, the measured velocity is K, which is linked to the planet's mass and the orbit parameters.

Let me think of the formula in terms of Kepler's third law. Kepler's third law says that P² = (4π² G (M_star + M_p))^-1 * a^3.

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So P² ≈ (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So a³ ≈ (G M_star P²)/(4π² )

But how does this relate to the radial velocity?

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π a sin i) / P * (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) )

Wait, is that right? Or perhaps K = (v) = (2π a sin i) / (P * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But in the case where M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So, given that, we can write K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since both stars have the same mass (M_star same for both) and the planets have similar mass (so M_p is same for both), the ratio K2/K1 should be inversely proportional to the cube root of (P2/P1).

Wait, let me write the ratio.

K2/K1 = [ (M_p2 sin i2) / (M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3)) ) ] / [ (M_p1 sin i1) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3)) ) ]

But M_p is same for both planets (similar to Neptune), and assuming sin i is same (since the question doesn't state otherwise), then:

K2/K1 = (P1^(1/3) ) / (P2^(1/3) )

Which can be rearranged as:

K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Which implies:

(P2 / P1 ) = (K2 / K1 )^3

Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then if K2 is larger than K1, P2 must be shorter than P1.

Wait, let's write the proportionality.

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is same and M_star same:

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, K1 = (C) / (P1^(1/3)) 

K2 = (C) / (P2^(1/3)) 

Where C is a constant (for same M_p and M_star, and same sin i).

So, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

But in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So,

1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

To find P2/P1, we take reciprocal:

P2/P1 = (P1/P2)^(-1) = [ (1.4)^(-3) ) ] ?

Wait, perhaps I should cube both sides. Let me see.

Wait, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

=> (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2

So,

P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = (49/25) = 1.96

So, P1/P2 = 1.96 → P2 = P1 / 1.96 → P2/P1 = 1/1.96 ≈ 0.509.

Wait, but that's P2 is about 0.51 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So, P2 is shorter, so the factor is less than 1. Let me compute 1/1.96.

1.96 is close to 2, so 1/1.96 ≈ 0.509. So P2 is about half the period of P1.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-express that.

If (K2/K1) = 7/5 = 1.4, then (K2/K1)^3 = (1.4)^3 = 2.744.

Then, P1/P2 = 2.744 → P2 = P1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.365 * P1.

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.365 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so 0.365 times.

So the answer is P2 is about 0.36 times longer than P1. Or wait, the question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

Wait, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that would mean it's shorter. So the period is 0.36 times as long, not longer. So the correct factor is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let's make sure. Let me double-check the steps.

We had K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so P ∝ 1/(K^(3)).

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K = C / P^(1/3) → P = (C/K )^3.

So for each planet, P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

Therefore, the ratio of periods is (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Because P ∝ (1/K)^3 → P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So, with K1=5, K2=7,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (25/49) ≈ 0.5102.

So, the period of planet 2 is approximately 0.51 times that of planet 1, meaning it's about half as long. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since 0.51 is less than 1, P2 is shorter, so the factor is 0.51 times as long, or about 0.5 times. But the options don't have 0.5 exactly. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

Wait, based on our calculation, (5/7)^3 is (5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So 0.364 is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

So the answer is A) ~0.36.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This implies:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.36**.
