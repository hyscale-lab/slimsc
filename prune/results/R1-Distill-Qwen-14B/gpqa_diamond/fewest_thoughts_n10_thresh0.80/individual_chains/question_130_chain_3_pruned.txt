Okay, so I have this question about redshift and detecting objects with ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, I remember that redshift is related to the expansion of the universe, right? When a galaxy or quasar is moving away from us, the light it emits gets redshifted. But wait, the question is about clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars. Oh right, that's the Lyman-alpha forest phenomenon.

So the Lyman-alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But for ground-based optical telescopes, they can't observe ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs that light. So the idea is that if the quasar's light is redshifted enough, the absorption line (from the hydrogen clouds) would move into the optical range that we can observe.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So what's the minimum redshift needed for the Lyman-alpha absorption to be in the optical range. Let me think about the formulas.

The redshift z is given by the formula λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z). So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms (which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nm), we want the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. What's the optical range for ground-based telescopes? I think visible light is roughly 400-700 nm. So the Lyman-alpha line, when redshifted, should be within that range.

Wait, but wait. The question says the clouds are absorbing the quasar's light. So the quasar is at some higher redshift than the clouds. The clouds' hydrogen emits (or absorbs at) 1216 Angstroms, which is in the far UV. So for us to see this absorption line in the optical, it must have been redshifted into the optical.

So we need to find z such that 1216 * (1 + z) = lambda_observed, which is in the optical range, say around 400-700 nm.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at rest wavelength 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm). If the quasar is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength is
