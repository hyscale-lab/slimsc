Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is at rest, so that means the initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I think the neutrino (nu) has a negligible mass, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the case here. Wait, neutrinos are super light, so maybe we can ignore it or treat its mass as zero. That might simplify things.

So the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino. The options are given as pairs of energies, so I need to find both KEs.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also add up to zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

I remember that in such decay processes, the energy and momentum are conserved. So let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its mass is negligible). 

So energy conservation equation:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
Which is:
139.6 = (m_mu + KE_mu) + KE_nu

And for momentum conservation, since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other. So p_mu = -p_nu. The magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite.

But how do these relate to energy? Well, for each particle, the energy is related to the momentum via E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Since we're working in units where c=1, this simplifies to E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

So for the muon:
E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2
And for the neutrino (assuming m_nu=0):
E_nu^2 = p_nu^2

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), we can write E_nu = p_mu * c, but again, in these units, E_nu = p_mu.

So, let's denote p_mu as p. Then E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p.

Putting this into the energy equation:
139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p

That's an equation in terms of p. Let me write that down:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm. Let's solve for p. Let me rearrange the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2

So the equation becomes:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2

I can subtract p^2 from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p

Now, let's compute (105.7)^2 and (139.6)^2.

Calculating 105.7 squared: approximately 11171. (Wait, 100^2=10,000, 105.7^2= (100+5.7)^2=10000 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6 squared: Let's see, 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140-0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So substituting back:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p

Let me compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So, 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 * p

Let's rearrange to solve for p:

279.2 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49

What's 19488.16 - 11172.49? Let me calculate that.

19488.16
-11172.49
------------ 
= 8315.67

So, 279.2 * p = 8315.67

Divide both sides by 279.2:

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Calculating 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. Let me see:

279.2 * 29.8: Let's compute 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84, so 8376-55.84=8320.16. Close to 8315.67. So 29.8 gives 8320.16, which is a bit higher.

Wait, maybe I should compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me approximate.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 8.31567 / 0.2792 ≈ 29.75.

Wait, 0.2792 * 29.75 = ?

0.2792 * 30 = 8.376, but 29.75 is 30 - 0.25. So 8.376 - (0.27
