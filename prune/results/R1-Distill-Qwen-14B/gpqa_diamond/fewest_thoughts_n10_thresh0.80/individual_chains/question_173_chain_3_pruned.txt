Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics concepts. But let's take it step by step. The question is about the uncertainty principle and estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says the electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But here, I think the question is about the uncertainty in energy, not just momentum. So maybe I need to connect the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in momentum.

Oh right, because the electron's kinetic energy is related to its momentum. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So if there's an uncertainty in momentum Δp, that would lead to an uncertainty in energy ΔE. 

Let me jot down the formulas I need. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I'll take the equality: Δx * Δp = ħ/2. From this, I can solve for Δp: Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

Once I have Δp, how does that relate to ΔE? Well, the kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Wait, but actually, when you take the uncertainty in p squared, you have (Δp)^2, so maybe the uncertainty in E is (Δp)^2/(2m). Since p is in the denominator, the square would matter.

Let's plug in the numbers. I need to compute ΔE. So first, calculate Δp using the uncertainty principle.

Given:
Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters (since 1 nm is 1e-9 m).
ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) 
Let me compute that denominator: 2 * 0.1e-9 is 0.2e-9 = 2e-10.

So Δp = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-24. 

1.0545718 divided by 2 is approximately 0.527e-24. Wait, no, wait: 1e-34 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-24. Oh right, because when you divide exponents, you subtract them. So 1e-34 / 1e-10 =
