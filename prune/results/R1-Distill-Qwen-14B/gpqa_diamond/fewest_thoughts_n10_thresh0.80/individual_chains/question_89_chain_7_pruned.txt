Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid and has four cyclohexane rings fused together in a particular way. The starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so it has two bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3.

First, the compound is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows specific peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR spectrum has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

I think about what reaction would happen here. KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Heating a dibromide with a base usually leads to an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. But wait, since it's a dihalide, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming an alkene.

But wait, in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, it's more likely to undergo a double E2 elimination. The two bromides are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, so elimination would form a double bond. But adamantane is a highly strained structure, but elimination would form an allene? Or maybe a transannular elimination?

Wait, no, the product here is an epoxide. Oh wait, wait. Another thought: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But in this case, the IR absorption at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl peak, maybe an ester or ketone. But how does that happen from an elimination?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If KOH is present in excess and heated, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. But substitution of two bromides would give what? Maybe a diol? But then where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, another possibility: the compound could undergo a Hofmann elimination. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxides form when two adjacent OH groups lose a water molecule. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is probably a carbonyl. That suggests that product 1 is an ester or a ketone. But wait, if it's a ketone, the structure would have a carbonyl group. But how does KOH lead to that?

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the dibromide reacts with KOH, it undergoes a substitution followed by elimination. But wait, if it's KOH, which is a strong base, it's more likely to eliminate. So, perhaps the dibromide loses two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkene. But then where is the carb
