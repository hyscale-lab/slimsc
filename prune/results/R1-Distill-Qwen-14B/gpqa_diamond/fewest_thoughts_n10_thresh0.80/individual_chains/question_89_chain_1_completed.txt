--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, adamantane... I remember it's a diamondoid structure, which is like a cage-like molecule. The 1,3-dibromo would mean there are Br atoms on positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. That sounds like an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two Br atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so it could cause the formation of an alkene via E2 mechanism. But wait, since there are two adjacent bromines, maybe it forms an allene, or perhaps a diene? Or maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When KOH is used, each Br could eliminate to form a double bond. Because in vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens), elimination typically forms a double bond. But wait, 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent. Oh, so it's not a vicinal dihalide. That complicates things. So maybe it's a double elimination where each Br leaves, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, causing an E2 elimination for each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent on the adamantane structure. So maybe the elimination leads to a diene? Or perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons in some way when looking at the structure.

Wait, maybe each bromine is on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Because adamantane is like a diamond structure, so perhaps positions 1 and 3 are adjacent in some way, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. In any case, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, which suggests it's an alkene. The IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe a ketone? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Wait, no, wait: another thought. Wait, 1720 is around the region for an ester or a ketone. But the product after KOH might form an epoxide? No, wait, KOH and dihalide? Maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation? Or perhaps a double elimination to form a ring with a double bond.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a deshielded region, maybe for an OCH2 group. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, 4.79 ppm is about where an epoxide's protons appear. Or perhaps it's an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. But wait, with KOH, maybe the product is a diol. But earlier, the IR peak suggests a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, the initial reaction is with KOH. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH. Let me think: when a dihalide reacts with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo elimination to form an alkene if the halides are vicinal. But since 1 and 3 are not adjacent, perhaps this is a case where each Br is eliminated, but perhaps in a way that forms two double bonds? Or maybe an allene.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the formation of a ketone. Wait, but wait, KOH is a base, so maybe it's more of an elimination than a substitution. Wait, but another possibility: if each bromide is on a bridgehead, and elimination occurs, perhaps forming a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that can't be right. So maybe elimination is not possible, so substitution occurs? But KOH is a strong base, so substitution would require a good leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a case where each Br is eliminated, but not in the same molecule. Wait, getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the NMR data of product 1. 

The 1H NMR shows: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl.

Wait, IR at 1720 could be a ketone. But the NMR doesn't show any carbonyl protons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or an amide, but in this case, the reaction is with KOH, so perhaps an epoxide? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexane derivative with an epoxide. Wait, but the NMR shows 4.79 for 2H. Epoxide protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but maybe that's it.

Wait, another angle: the product could be an ether, but I'm not sure. If it's a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a Hofmann elimination or similar, but that's for amines. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Well, if each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would require a substitution. But KOH is more likely to induce elimination. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are each on bridgehead carbons. So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but since they're on bridgeheads, perhaps each elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, which isn't allowed. Therefore, maybe the elimination is not possible, and instead, some kind of substitution occurs.

Wait, but substitution would require a good nucleophile. KOH provides OH- as a nucleophile. So perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group. But then, 1,3-diol product. But the NMR doesn't show any broad OH peaks, so maybe they're exchanged with the solvent, but the NMR data given includes 4.79 (2H), which might be two adjacent CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol where the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, but how? Unless there's a rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: looking for the IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. So perhaps the dibromide undergoes some kind of elimination to form a ketone. Hmm, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a dehydration followed by some other process. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation, but I don't think KOH is an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, where each Br leaves, and the electrons form two new bonds, maybe creating a ring with a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination would form an allene or a conjugated diene. But in adamantane, that might form a bridge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm. Wait, maybe the product is a diene, but the IR doesn't have a peak for that. So back to thinking about the NMR.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H). Maybe that's an -OCH2- group. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests maybe some methyl groups adjacent to something de-shielding them. 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches. So maybe it's an ether. But then, 4.79 ppm for two H could be an ether CH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ether. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane eliminates HBr twice, perhaps forming a ring with an oxygen. But wait, if KOH is present, maybe it's an elimination to form an oxide. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another possibility: The product could be a geminal diol. But that would require each Br to be replaced by an OH on the same carbon, which would give a compound with two OH groups on the same carbon. But that's not very stable, and the NMR doesn't show broad peaks, so perhaps the OH groups are exchanged and not observed.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, but I'm not seeing how that would form from dibromide with KOH.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the IR and NMR data again.

IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or an ester. The NMR at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe it's an acetate group, but the 1720 cm-1 might support an ester or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that would require two carbonyl groups. Not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a six-membered ring with an oxygen? Or maybe the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but for each Br, leading to two OH groups. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring. No, but that doesn't fit the data.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product is a ketone, and the IR peak is for that. So how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon heating with KOH? Maybe via elimination and some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the carbons that were bonded to Br form double bonds. But with two Br's, maybe two double bonds form, leading to a conjugated diene. But then, the NMR would show peaks for the alkene protons.

But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest alkenes, unless the peaks are in another region or are part of a multiplet. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the alkenes are in a ring, making the protons equivalent and perhaps appearing as a singlet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diene. Then, the 1H NMR would show some signals in the alkene region (around 5-6 ppm), but the data given is 4.79 ppm, which is lower than that. So maybe it's not an alkene.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic structure with a ketone. For example, if two HBr molecules are eliminated, perhaps forming a bridge and a ketone.

Wait, that might make sense. Suppose each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is present, each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form double bonds, but due to the structure, a ring might open or a new ring forms. Alternatively, the elimination of two HBr could lead to the formation of a ketone. Hmm, not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether. But I'm really getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about product 2. The first product (product 1) is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group (the IR suggests), perhaps it's a ketone. Then, product 1 could undergo some kind of acylation or alkylation using AlCl3 as a catalyst. But wait, aluminum isopropoxide is used as a catalyst in, for example, the formation of epoxides, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some addition or polymerization. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes ring-opening. But that would form product 2, which then is ozonized.

Wait, but let's move to the next step. Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Then, after ozonolysis and work-up with dimethyl sulfide, product 3 is formed, which presumably has carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But wait, the question is about the NMR of product 3, focusing on the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, putting this together:

Product 1: formed by heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Product 1's NMR has a peak at 4.79 (2H), possibly an OCH2 group, and IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an OCH2 group. For example, maybe a cyclic ketone with an ether link, like a cyclic ether ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any carbonyl protons, which would be around 2-3 ppm as a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an -OCH2- group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be CH2 or CH3 groups. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. Wait, but an epoxide would have two protons near 3.5-4.5 ppm. In this case, 4.79 is a bit higher, but possible.

But then, the IR doesn't show the typical epoxide C-O-C stretching around 1200-1300 cm-1. The given IR is at 1720, which is higher.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: The product is a ketone and an epoxide. For example, a compound with both a ketone and an epoxide group. But I'm not sure how that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diethyl ether derivative, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ether, such as an adamantane derivative with an oxygen bridge. Then, the NMR would show an OCH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base, and heating can promote elimination. So perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two E2 eliminations, each losing HBr. Each elimination would form a double bond. So, if the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination, two double bonds might form. But that's a lot of strain, so perhaps it forms a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the product after elimination might be a diene, and the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first step is an elimination to form a ketone via some kind of peroxide formation, but I don't think KOH would do that.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is eliminated as Br- with deprotonation, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group via keto-enol tautomerism. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure with a bridge containing an oxygen, such as an epoxide. Wait, if the bridgehead carbons are the ones that had the Br, then elimination could form an epoxide. But then, the O would be in the bridge, leading to a strained epoxide.

But the NMR for product 1 shows 4.79(2H), which could be the two protons on the epoxide. So for a typical epoxide, the protons are around 3.5-4.5 ppm. 4.79 is a bit upfield, but possible.

The IR at 1720 cm-1 would be a strong carbonyl, but an epoxide doesn't have a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone and an epoxide. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol ether. Enol ethers have protons around 4-5 ppm, and the C=O would be around 1700 cm-1. So maybe that's the case.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to move forward, perhaps the structure of product 1 is 1,3-adamantanediyl di-O-K salt, but that's more of a substitution product, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, and the IR at 1720 is for the ketone. Then, the 4.79 (2H) could be adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to the ketone. Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) would be the other CH groups in the adamantane structure, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2.

So, product 1 is a ketone, perhaps 1,3-diketone on adamantane. Then, when product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, it might undergo some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that typically requires aromatic rings. Adamantane isn't aromatic, so maybe it's used for some other type of acylation, or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, and the Lewis acid facilitates some kind of reaction. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: product 2 is treated with ozone. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. So in the second step, product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating, leading to product 2, which has a double bond.

So, product 1 is perhaps an epoxide, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. But then, product 2 would be a diol. Ozonolysis wouldn't affect that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some aldol condensation to form a conjugated enone, which has a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ether, and upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some elimination to form a double bond. Then, product 2 would have a double bond.

Wait, let's try to outline the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH â product 1 (light yellow solid). NMR has 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). IR: 1720 cm-1.

2. Product 1 + excess Al isopropoxide, heated â product 2.

3. Product 2 â ozonolysis at -78Â°C, then dimethyl sulfide â product 3.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, particularly the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

So, product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have at least one double bond.

Product 1's structure: Given the IR at 1720, which is a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 could be an enol ether or an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, undergoes some kind of dehydration to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). Then, product 2 would have a conjugated double bond, which upon ozonolysis would break into two carbonyls.

So, let's suppose product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone. Ozonolysis of the enone would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But then, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The NMR of product 3 would then show protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, perhaps as CH2 or CH groups.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would likely be adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

If the original structure is an enone (product 2), ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. So, depending on the structure, the resulting product would have two ketone groups, perhaps leading to a diketone.

But let me think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is an enone, something like:

R1-C=O-R2-CH2-CH2-O-R3

No, perhaps it's a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is a diol, but then ozonolysis wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyls.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Let's try to think about product 3's NMR.

Product 3's NMR: the most deshielded H. The most deshielded would be near electronegative groups, like oxygen. So perhaps it's a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each end becomes a carbonyl group. So if product 2 had a symmetric double bond, product 3 would have two identical carbonyl groups. But if the double bond was asymmetric, product 3 would have two different carbonyl groups.

But in any case, the H adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', the H's on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

But wait, the splitting pattern depends on neighboring protons. So, for a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H would be split by neighboring H's.

Wait, for a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H is adjacent to two other H's on the same CH2. So each H is a doublet, because each H has one neighboring H on the same CH2. But wait, no, in a CH2 group, each H is next to one H on the same group. So each H would be a doublet due to coupling with the other H on the same CH2. But if there's another coupling, like with adjacent groups, it could become more complex.

Wait, but ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, so the adjacent groups would be the R groups from each end of the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, and the H's adjacent to the carbonyls are each on a CH2 group.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 has a structure like R-CH2-CH2- (with a double bond between the CH2 groups). Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two R-CHO groups. So product 3 would be two aldehyde groups.

But in the case of a cyclic structure, perhaps the ozonolysis would form two ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is done on a bridged bicyclic compound, leading to a diketone.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the original structure is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups, possibly leading to a structure with two ketones.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Let me try to approach this from another angle.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. Let's consider possible coupling patterns.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

In an NMR, a triplet occurs when a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group (two neighboring protons). A triplet of triplets would be if each proton is coupled to two different sets of protons with different coupling constants. A pentet would be if a proton is adjacent to a CH4 group (four neighboring H's), which would split into a quintet.

But in product 3, after ozonolysis, the structure likely has carbonyl groups, which would cause adjacent protons to be deshielded.

Suppose product 3 is a dialdehyde. Then, each aldehyde proton (around 9-10 ppm) would be a singlet, as aldehydic protons typically are. But the question specifies to exclude exchangeable protons, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, product 3 could have a structure like (CH2)n-C=O. The H's on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would be deshielded. For example, if the structure is CH2-CO-R, the H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl and split by neighboring H's.

If the CH2 is next to the carbonyl and has two neighboring CH2 groups, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, for example, if the structure is CH2-CO-R, and the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H on the central CH2 would be coupled with two H's on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have coupling with two H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, the splitting would be different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about a specific example. Suppose product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2(CO)R. Then, the H's on the middle CH2 would be next to two other CH2 groups. Each H on the middle CH2 would couple with two H's on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the structure is (CH2)3(CO)R, the middle CH2 would have H's that couple with two H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

If a proton is coupled with two sets of two protons each, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if a proton is coupled with a CH2 group and another CH group, the splitting could be a doublet of triplets (option C), but that depends on the structure.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group. So each H on the middle CH2 would be split by two neighboring H's on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is CH2-CH2-CO-R. The H's on the middle CH2 would each have two neighboring H's on each adjacent CH2. So each H would be split into a triplet by the adjacent H's on one side, and another triplet from the other side. The combination would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's are on a CH group next to a carbonyl. Then, each H would be a doublet, but that doesn't match the options given.

Hmm.

Another angle: after ozonolysis, the product would have carbonyl groups. The protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded. For example, in a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', each CH2 group next to the carbonyl would have protons that are deshielded.

If the CH2 groups are each adjacent to another CH2 group, the protons on each CH2 would be split by the neighboring protons.

For instance, in the structure (CH2)2(CO)R, the middle CH2 would have H's that are split by the neighboring CH2 groups. Each H would couple with two H's on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have two couplings: one from the left CH2 and one from the right CH2. If each coupling is a triplet, the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are similar, it could be a pentet, but that would require coupling with four equivalent H's, which isn't the case here.

So, considering all this, the most likely coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon heating with KOH, the product (1) is formed, characterized by an IR absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹ (indicating a carbonyl group) and an NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting an -OCHâ- group. The remaining signals (2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H and 1.94 ppm for 2H) correspond to alkyl protons. This suggests that product 1 is likely a ketone or an enol ether derivative.

When product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, it forms product 2. Given the role of aluminum isopropoxide, product 2 likely contains a double bond, possibly an Î±,Î²-unsaturated ketone (enone), as this would set up the molecule for subsequent ozonolysis.

Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78Â°C cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups, resulting in a structure where the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would exhibit a coupling pattern influenced by neighboring protons.

Considering the splitting patterns:
- A **triplet** occurs when a proton is coupled to two equivalent protons (e.g., on a CHâ group).
- A **triplet of triplets** arises when a proton is coupled to two sets of two non-equivalent protons, leading to two distinct triplet couplings.
- A **doublet of triplets** involves a proton coupled to one proton and two equivalent protons.
- A **pentet** results from coupling with four equivalent protons (e.g., on a CHâ group).

In product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely on a CHâ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This CHâ group would be flanked by two other CHâ groups, causing each hydrogen to couple with two protons on each adjacent CHâ. This results in a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

ANSWER: B
