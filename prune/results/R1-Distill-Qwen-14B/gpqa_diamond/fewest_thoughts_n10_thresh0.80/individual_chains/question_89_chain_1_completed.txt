Okay, I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let's see, the question involves several reaction steps and analyzing the resulting NMR spectra. Hmm, I need to go step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a cage-like molecule. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C... Oh wait, KOH is a strong base. So, that probably leads to an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms on the adamantane, dehydrohalogenation would occur. But wait, in what positions? 1,3-dibromo suggests that the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Or wait, the numbering might be different. But regardless, when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you form a double bond. So the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, right? Or maybe another structure—wait, perhaps it's forming an allene because the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons? No, if it's 1,3-dibromo, maybe the elimination leads to a diene.

Wait, the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Hmm, 4.79 is probably an -OH proton, but wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but 1720 is more like an ester or ketone. So maybe product 1 isn't an alkene but a ketone or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to an epoxide? No, I don't think so. Wait, another possibility: heating with KOH can cause elimination to form an alkene, but perhaps if it's a dihalide, it could form an epoxide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... no, epoxide would be from vicinal dihalide, but 1,3 are not adjacent. Oh wait, no, 1,3 positions are on the same adamantane structure. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that when KOH is added, it abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe product 1 is an ester or ketone. Wait, but heating a dihalide with KOH would typically lead to elimination, not oxidation. Unless there's some oxidation involved. Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution. Wait, but KOH is a base, more likely elimination. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromines, maybe it's a double substitution. But with KOH in excess, perhaps it's forming a dialkoxide. Wait, but then where would the carbonyl come from? Maybe the adamantane structure has some methyl groups. Wait, adamantane is a diamond-like structure with all single bonds and each carbon connected to three others. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two non-adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps when KOH is added, it induces elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, how? Maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. Or perhaps, the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a conjugated diene, which is then oxidized. But I'm not sure. Let me think again about the product.

The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around the region for an ether or maybe an alcohol. But the IR shows a carbonyl. Maybe it's an ester. Wait, but if it's a ketone, the carbonyl would be higher, around 1700-1750. Wait, the given IR is 1720, which is a typical ester or ketone. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone. So, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination, the two bromides are removed, and a ketone is formed. Because in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) might be an -OH, but wait, in product 1, is it an alcohol or a ketone? The IR suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps the product is a ketone, but then where do the 2H at 4.79 come from?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the reaction again. KOH and 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When KOH is heated with a dihalide, sometimes it can lead to elimination to form a double bond, but if the dihalide is not vicinal, elimination may not occur. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution, but that would require a good leaving group. If it's a dihalide, maybe it's a double substitution, but that would form a metalated compound, which would then eliminate to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a diketone? Or maybe an annulene. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR in product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, perhaps an -OH group? But if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but the IR doesn't show the epoxide's C-O-C stretch around 1250 cm^-1. The IR is at 1720, which is more of a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination gives 1,3-adamantadiene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a conjugate base which then eliminates, forming a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, for example, if Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br, and the base abstracts a hydrogen, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. Wait, but then why the carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe the initial product is an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OH group, but if it's a ketone, then maybe that's another part of the molecule. Or perhaps those 2H are part of an ethylene group adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's an ester, like an ethyl ester. So, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2CH3 group. Let me think: the ethyl ester's OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 ppm, perhaps, but if it's something else, like a different substitution pattern, maybe it's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's less likely.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a dialkyl ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Wait, KOH could substitute Br with O- groups, but that would form an alkoxide, which upon protonation would give an alcohol. But then where does the carbonyl come from?

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I don't see the C-O-C peaks in IR. Wait, maybe the IR at 1720 is an ester. So, perhaps the product is an ester.

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a 2H triplet at 4.79. That might be a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom or group. For example, an -OCH2- group. If that's the case, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but the IR doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Wait, the 2H at 4.79 could be part of a carbonyl-adjacent group, like a CH2CO structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let's say that 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form 1,3-adamantane-1,3-dione? No, that would require both carbonyls, which I don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but then that doesn't explain the carbonyl. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Wait, if the original molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to an alkoxide, which upon protonation gives an alcohol. But then how do we get a carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I should move to the next step and see if that helps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions or perhaps in some elimination or alkylation. So, maybe product 1 is an ester or alkyl halide, and product 2 is formed via some Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an ether formed via some Williamson ether synthesis, but I don't know.

Wait, but the first reaction produces product 1, which has a carbonyl. So, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and when treated with Al(isoprop)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination or ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, and in the presence of a Lewis acid, it forms an acylium ion or something, leading to further reaction.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the third step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis breaks it. So, product 2 is an alkene.

But wait, in that case, product 1 must have a functional group that upon reaction with Al isopropoxide forms an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and in the presence of the Lewis acid, it undergoes elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, let me go back. Product 1 has a carbonyl. So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination of the ketone. Wait, how? If product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene, perhaps product 2 is formed via some kind of enolization and elimination. Or maybe product 1 is a vicinal diol, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid eliminates to form an alkene. Wait, but product 1 is formed via KOH and 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but I thought the IR didn't support that.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ester. Let's think: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with excess KOH, maybe it forms a diol. Wait, but a diol would have two -OH groups, perhaps. But the IR doesn't show broad peaks around 3300 cm-1, which would correspond to O-H stretches. The IR is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on product 1. Let's try to make an assumption. Let's say product 1 is an ester, perhaps ethyl ester. The 4.79 ppm (2H) would correspond to the OCH2CH3 group. Then, product 2 would be formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but product 1 is an ester, which isn't an alkylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ether, but again, not sure.

Wait, another approach. Ozonolysis is done on product 2, which forms product 3. So, product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups in place of the double bond.

In the NMR of product 3, we're asked about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. The most deshielded would typically be near an electronegative atom or part of a carbonyl group.

Wait, the most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl. In ozonolysis, a double bond is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and the Hs attached to the adjacent carbons would be deshielded.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is an alkene derived from product 1. So, product 2 is an alkene, and when ozonolyzed, it breaks into two carbonyl compounds.

But let's think about the structure of product 2. If product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, then product 2 would be something else, perhaps a diene. Wait, no, because product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 would be formed via some reaction with Al isopropoxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diester, and product 2 is the corresponding alkene. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But perhaps I should think about the splitting in the NMR. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, product 3 has carbonyl groups, so the adjacent Hs would be deshielded and split based on their neighboring Hs.

If the double bond in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, say, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups with CH2 groups adjacent. Each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would couple with the adjacent CH2.

Wait, for example, if product 2 is CH2CH2 (but that's not possible), or more accurately, perhaps the structure is such that each end of the double bond is CH2, leading to CH3 groups upon ozonolysis? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is between two CH groups, each attached to a carbonyl. So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH that has two Hs. Those Hs would be coupled with each other.

Wait, but how would the coupling work? Each H would have neighboring Hs on the same carbon (geminal) and on the adjacent carbons (vicinal).

Wait, another example: if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But in this case, maybe the structure is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, say, CH2=CH2, but ozonolysis would split into two formaldehyde molecules, which wouldn't have any Hs. So that's not the case.

Wait, let's think about product 3's NMR. The most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Suppose the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. No, that's a diester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone.

Wait, if product 2 is an internal diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. For instance, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes with a CH2 group in between. But in reality, the structure is more complex due to the adamantane framework.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is in a position that, upon ozonolysis, yields two carbonyl groups adjacent to each other, leading to a diketone. For example, if product 2 is cyclohexene, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups connected by a single bond. But in this case, perhaps the structure is more like a bicyclic system.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded H in product 3 is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 group. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs on the same carbon (geminal) and two on the adjacent (vicinal). But wait, geminal coupling is usually not observed in 1H NMR because the Hs are equivalent and split each other into a singlet. However, in vicinal coupling, each H would split into a triplet if coupled with two Hs.

Wait, no, if each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent carbon, each would show as a triplet. Because each H is adjacent to two equivalent Hs, so n+1 rule: 2+1=3, so triplet.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. So, if each H is coupled with two Hs on the same carbon (but they're equivalent, so no splitting) and two Hs on the adjacent carbon (each H on adjacent C is split into a triplet), but wait, if the H is coupled to two Hs on one adjacent C and another two Hs on another adjacent C, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. No, that's not possible because ozonolysis breaks the double bond into carbonyls. So, if the double bond in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would form two carbonyls, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each connected to a CH2. The Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl, making them deshielded. Each H on the CH2 would be next to another CH2 group, so each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (but since they're equivalent, they don't split), and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (different group, so they do split).

Wait, but each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, the coupling constant would be the same for both, leading to a triplet of triplets? Or would it be a doublet of triplets?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each CH2's Hs are adjacent to the other CH2's Hs. So, each H on the first CH2 is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet (n=2, so triplet). But wait, each H is also adjacent to another H on the same CH2, but since they are equivalent, they don't cause splitting. So, each H would only split due to the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

So, each H would be a triplet. But wait, in reality, each H is coupled to two Hs on one side and two on the other. No, because each CH2 is between two carbonyls. Wait, no, each CH2 is between a carbonyl and another CH2. So, each H on CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2. Thus, each H would have two neighboring Hs, so each would be a triplet.

But that would make the most deshielded Hs (on the CH2 next to the carbonyls) show as triplets. Looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, but perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent carbon. Wait, but each H is only adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet. So, in the NMR, each H would be a triplet. So, the most deshielded Hs would be triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the splitting could be more complex. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-. The Hs on each CH2 would be adjacent to each other. Each H on the first CH2 is next to two Hs on the second CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet. So, yes, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, the Hs on each CH2 are equivalent, so their splitting would be the same. So, in the NMR, each CH2 would appear as a triplet.

So, the correct answer would be triplet, which is option A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH likely results in a double elimination, forming a carbonyl-containing compound. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group, and the NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H) suggests the presence of a methylene group near an electronegative atom or group. Thus, product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantanone, a ketone.

2. **Reaction with Al(isoprop)₃**: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide likely facilitates enolization or elimination, forming an alkene. This product 2 contains a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step targets alkenes.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern due to the n+1 rule (n = 2, so 2+1 = 3). Therefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen is a triplet.
