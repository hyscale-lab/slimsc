Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this decay probability question. Hmm, let me think. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and it doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh wait, that's the key—decay is independent of the time elapsed. So if the atom hasn't decayed yet, it doesn't change its future probability.

The question says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So that's like the probability that the atom decays sometime in the first 100 minutes after we start monitoring. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, what's the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, wait. Next 150 minutes from when? Oh, I think it's the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So the total time since the start would be 50 +150=200 minutes. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, does it mean the next 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start?

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" So 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the initial start.

So the initial setup is that the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%. Let me think. The decay probability is given by the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. So for t=100, P(100)=0.32.

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me rearrange that to find λ. Subtract 1: 0.32-1 = -e^(-λ*100) → -0.68 = -e^(-λ*100) → e^(-λ*100)=0.68. Take ln of both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating that: ln(0.68) is about ln(2/3) is around... wait, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. So from time t=50 to t=200, which is a duration of 150 minutes. The probability of decay in this period is the same as the probability that the atom decays at any time between t=50 and t=200.

But wait, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same regardless of the time elapsed. Wait no, wait. The probability that it decays within a certain time period after any time t is given by the same formula because the decay process
