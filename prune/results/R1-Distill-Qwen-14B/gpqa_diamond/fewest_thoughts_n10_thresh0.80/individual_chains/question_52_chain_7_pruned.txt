Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this stuff. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels under different conditions of the star. The setup is that the star has spots which cover 40% of its surface, causing the overall effective temperature to drop. When the spots aren't present, the effective temperature is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. 

The key point here is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio (n1/n2) goes down when the temperature is lower. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

First, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio decreases. So with spots, n1/n2 is lower. That means that the higher energy level (level 2) gains more population when the temperature drops. Because in the Boltzmann factor, when T decreases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases if ΔE is positive (since denominator is smaller, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, so exp of a more negative number is smaller? Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the energy difference is E2 - E1. Let's say E2 > E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative (because ΔE/(k T) is larger, since T is smaller), so exp of that is smaller. So the factor (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if T decreases, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) decreases, so n1/n2 decreases. Which is what the problem states. So the observed behavior makes sense.

The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes. So when the star isn't spotted, T is higher, and when spotted, T is lower. So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

Let me write this out. (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). But since the statistical weights g1 and g2 are constants (they don't change with temperature), the ratio of the ratios is just the ratio of the exponential terms. So the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ (1/(
