Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots cover part of its surface. The main thing we're looking at is the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does. 

First, I'll try to understand the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, no, that part might not directly affect the ratio. The spots probably cause the overall temperature measured to drop, but maybe the question is about the photosphere's temperature. Oh, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm, maybe the spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the average Teff goes down.

But for the photosphere, the bulk of the star's surface when not covered by spots is at 6000 K, but when 40% is covered, the effective temp is 5500 K. But wait, that might not be the right way to model it. Maybe the spots are cooler, so the average flux is lower, but the photosphere's temperature is still varying because parts are cooler and others are not. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So I think that when 40% is covered, the effective temperature (the average) is 5500 K.

But wait, the problem states that the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler. So without spots, the star's Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere (which is the overall star) is 5500 K. Wait, no, the wording is: "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K
