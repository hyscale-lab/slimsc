Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density.

Let me read the options again:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

The options given as answers are A to D, each corresponding to a to d. So, I need to figure out the density of each and determine which is the highest.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So density = mass/volume. But wait, the volume of a planet is based on its radius, right? The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if two planets have the same composition, their masses and radii should scale in a certain way.

Let me think about each option.

Option a: Earth mass and Earth radius. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I believe. Because Earth is made of rock and metal. So for this option, density is same as Earth's which is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density is already given as 5.5. Hmm, but wait, if the mass is double Earth's but the density is same, then the volume must be double as well. Because density is mass/volume, so if mass doubles and density stays same, volume must double. But wait, volume depends on radius cubed. So if volume doubles, radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. So like, radius increases by about 1.26 times. But that's not directly relevant right now. Since option b says the density is 5.5, which is same as Earth, so its density is 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, so same density as Earth? Wait, if a planet has the same composition, then its density should be same as Earth's. Because density depends on the materials it's made of. So, if it's 5 times more massive, but same composition, the density remains 5.5. But wait, perhaps the radius would
