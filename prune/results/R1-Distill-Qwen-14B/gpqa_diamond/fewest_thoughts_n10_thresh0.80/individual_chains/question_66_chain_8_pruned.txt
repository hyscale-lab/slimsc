Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the fields they involve. But wait, when it comes to symmetries, I think that SMEFT maintains some of the symmetries of the Standard Model but might not necessarily include others.

Let's start with Lorentz symmetry. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all the interactions and fields transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations. SMEFT, as an effective theory, should also respect Lorentz symmetry because if it didn't, that would imply new physics at a lower scale, which isn't the usual approach. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. That means option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations in spacetime. In effective field theories, we typically work in a fixed spacetime background, like Minkowski space, which respects Poincare symmetry. So SMEFT operators should respect Poincare symmetry because they're part of an effective theory in a Poincare-invariant framework. So option 2 is correct too. Wait, but is that always the case? I think that the SMEFT is built under the assumption that the underlying theory respects Poincare, so yes, operators must. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Now, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric, right? For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes. In SMEFT, operators can violate CP because the effective operators can include terms that break CP. Wait, but wait. SMEFT includes all possible operators, so some could break CP but others might not. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if some operators in SMEFT violate CP, then option 3 (CP symmetry) isn't necessarily a symmetry that all operators respect. So option 3 isn't a must. So 3 is out
