Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. Then, it's treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, what reaction does that lead to? I think when ketones react with bromine, it's probably an addition reaction. Maybe it's a halohydrin formation? Or wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent like CCl4 might cause an addition across the carbonyl group. Oh wait, no, wait. Another possibility: maybe it's a ring bromination. But cyclohexanone's carbonyl is not as reactive as alkenes. Wait, no, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's an enolate formation? Or perhaps it's a dihalide formation via some other mechanism.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking of a different reaction. Oh right, when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it's probably undergoing a bromohydrin formation. But wait, in aqueous conditions, maybe that's the case. But if it's just bromine without water, perhaps it's a different pathway. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzilic acid type of addition. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think again: bromine adds across the carbonyl group. Oh, right!
