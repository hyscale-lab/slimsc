Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that these synthesis problems often involve a series of reactions, and each step adds or modifies a functional group. Let's break it down.

The starting material is benzene. The first reaction is with HNO3 and H2SO4. I recall that nitric acid in sulfuric acid is a nitrating agent. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution with nitric acid, typically nitrating the ring. The position depends on the directing groups. Since benzene itself is activating and meta-directing, but wait, nitration usually occurs in the meta position? Or wait, no, nitration is a meta-directing group when it's already present. But wait, benzene is a benzene ring without any substituents, so adding nitro group would go into the meta position? No, wait, for benzene, the nitration occurs at the meta position? Hmm, no, I think nitration is more likely to occur at the meta position when directed by a nitro group. Wait, but the first step is just benzene reacting with nitric acidâ€”since benzene is activated, but wait, nitration of benzene is usually meta? Wait, no, actually, that's for when there's a substituent. Benzene's first substitution is at the ortho, meta, para positions equally? No, I think benzene is symmetric, so the product would just be nitrobenzene, but the position is actually para? Because when benzene is nitrated, the product is nitrobenzene, which is o-, m-, p-nitrobenzene. Wait, but without any substituents, the nitration can occur in any position but the major product is typically nitrobenzene, which is para? Or wait, wait, no, nitro groups are meta directors, but in the first substitution, when benzene itself is reacting, the nitration occurs in the meta position? No, wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so all positions are equivalent. So product 1 is nitrobenzene. But that can't be right because nitro groups are meta directors, but in the first substitution, it's just nitrobenzene, which is a single product.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Nitration of benzene adds a nitro group, creating nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenz
