Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that star_1 has iron atoms twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which probably means the Saha equation or Boltzmann equation applies here.

Wait, when they say the iron atoms are "twice as excited," I'm guessing they mean the population in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So, the ratio of excited to ground state atoms is higher in star_1.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since E_i is higher than E_j, the exponent is negative, so it's about the ratio of populations.

In this case, I think the energy difference is E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote it as ΔE. So for star 1, the ratio n1_excited / n1_ground = 2. For star 2, it's n2_excited / n2_ground = 1 (since star_1 is twice as excited). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * [(n2_i)/(n2_j)].

But wait, assuming the ground state is level j and excited is level i. So for star_1, the excitation is higher, so higher temperature? Because higher temperature would lead to more excitation.

So, let's write the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let me denote:

For star 1: (n1_i)/(n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: (n2_i)/(
