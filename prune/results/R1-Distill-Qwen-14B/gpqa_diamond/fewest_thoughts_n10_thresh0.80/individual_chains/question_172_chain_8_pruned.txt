Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I think that means the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's probably the energy required for an electron to jump between two energy levels.

Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I should use the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula I remember is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, right, so ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. Here, n2 is the population of the excited state, and n1 is the ground state. But wait, in this case, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for star_1, let's say n2 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, the ratio is 2, so n1_2 / n1_1 = 2, where n1_2 is the excited state population for star_1, and n1_1 is for star_2. Wait no, wait the question says in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the excitation ratio is higher in star_1. Let me get this straight.

So, for star 1, the number of excited atoms (n2) compared to the lower state (n1) is higher. So the ratio n2/n1 for star_1 is higher than that for star_2. Let me denote this ratio as R1 for star_1 and R2 for star_2.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think that R1 = 2 * R2. Because star_1 has twice the excitation. So R1 = 2 R2. Wait, no, wait. Let me make it precise: the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n2
