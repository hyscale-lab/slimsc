Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is symmetric in all directions, so the problem can be separated into radial and angular parts. But wait, I think for a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, no, actually, for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is the total quantum number. Oh wait, no, I think the formula is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But wait, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Alternatively, I've heard that in 3D, the energy levels can be labeled by a principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy becomes E = (N + 3/2) ħω. So for each energy level, the value of N determines the energy.

Now the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state and how do excited states work here. The ground state is the lowest energy, which would be when N=0, right? Because n_x, n_y, n_z are all zero. So the ground state is N=0, energy (3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be N=1. Because each increase in N by 1 corresponds to higher energy. So N=0 is the ground state, N=1 is first excited, N=2 is second, and N=3 is third excited. So the third excited state is N=3.

So the energy E for N=3 would be (3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, wait, no. Wait the formula is E = (N + 3/2) ħω, because N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So for N=3, E = 3 +
