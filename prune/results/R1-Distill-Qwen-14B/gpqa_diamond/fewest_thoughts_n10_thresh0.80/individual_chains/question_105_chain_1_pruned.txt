Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The setup is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could mimic an exoplanet transit. But the question is about the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

So, the main goal is to find the exoplanet's radius relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Let me think about how the brightness variations work in both cases.

First, when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amplitude of the dip in brightness depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The area is proportional to the square of the radius, so the formula would be (Rp / Rstar)^2.

But wait, in this problem, the star has spots. The spots are cooler and cover a part of the star. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. The overall effect on the brightness would be similar to a transit, but the calculation is a bit different.

The problem mentions that the filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere (assuming the star is a sphere) has one side with spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, no, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, but only one hemisphere is spotty. Oh, wait, the star is a sphere, so a hemisphere is half the surface. So the spots are covering 20% of that hemisphere, which is 0.2 * (surface area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * (2π R² / 2) )= 0.2 * π R². Wait, no, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². So the
