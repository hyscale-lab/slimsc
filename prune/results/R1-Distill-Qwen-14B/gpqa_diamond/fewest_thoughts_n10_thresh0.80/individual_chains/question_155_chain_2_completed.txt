Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) as a column vector. I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

First, I should check if the given state is normalized. Let's calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. The first component is (-1/2), so squared is 1/4. The second is (1/√2), squared is 1/2. The third is (-1/2), squared is 1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good, that's one step done.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the matrix P_z is diagonal, right? Looking at the given matrix for P_z, it's a 3x3 diagonal matrix with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ).

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities. Wait, wait, because the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue. Let me think:

The state is |ψ⟩ = [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

Each component squared (mod squared) gives the probability for each eigenstate. So the probabilities are:

|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 for eigenvalue ħ.

|b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 for eigenvalue 0.

|c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 for eigenvalue -ħ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = [ħ/4 - ħ/4] = 0. Oh, that's zero. Interesting.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So each eigenvalue squared is:

(ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → all (ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So putting it together, ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure. The state is given as a column vector, but in the P_z basis. Since P_z is diagonal, the expectation is straightforward. So yeah, I think that's correct.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the given quantum system, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Verify normalization of the state
The given state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.
\]

Thus, the state is normalized.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is the square of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which gives $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 4: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
