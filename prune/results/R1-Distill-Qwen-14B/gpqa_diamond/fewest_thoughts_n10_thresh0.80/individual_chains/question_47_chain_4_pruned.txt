Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are A to D. Let's start by looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Hmm, so let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So:

(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So 5 degrees. That could be one ring (benzene) and one double bond, or maybe a ring and some substituents. Wait, benzene has 3 double bonds, so 3 degrees, plus another double bond makes 4, but wait, the formula gives 5. Oh, maybe an amide group which has a double bond. So benzene ring (3 degrees), an amide (another double bond), so that's 4. Then a ketone or ester would add another double bond, making 5. So the molecule likely has a benzene ring, an amide or ester group, and maybe an ethyl group or something.

Looking at the IR data first. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Wait, but where? If it's an amide, there are typically two N-H stretches, but sometimes it could be a primary amide. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine. But wait, the options include benzamide and formamide, which are amides, and some with amines.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group. Could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the molecular formula doesn't have O in the formula beyond two, so let's see. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So two oxygens. So esters have two oxygens (like R-O-C-O-R'), amides have two O (like CONHR2). So the carbonyl could be an ester or amide.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl group attached to something that splits it into a triplet. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethyl ether.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Hmm, a broad peak could indicate an amide NH group, but wait, in an amide, the NH protons are usually around 6-8 ppm as broad signals, but maybe if it's an adjacent group? Or perhaps it's an ethylene group adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group. Wait, in an ester, the OCH2CH3 would have protons around 4.1 as a quartet, but that's not matching here. Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, so maybe an N-CH2 group or something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: Quartet with 2H suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. Like a CH2 group next to another CH2. For example, in an ethyl group, the quartet would be the next CH2. Wait, for ethyl ester, the CH2 attached to oxygen would be a quartet, but where would that be? Wait, noâ€” usually, the CH2 connected to the oxygen (like OCH2CH3) would split into a quartet, but in that case, the triplet would be the CH3. Oh, wait, the 1.20 triplet is the CH3, so the 4.5 quartet would be the OCH2. So maybe an ethyl ester group.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets in aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, you have two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets. So the substituents are on the para positions.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. So the substituents would be OCH2CH3 and CONH2. The aromatic protons would be in two doublets because of the substituents at positions 3 and... Wait, no, in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the amide is at position 1, the ethoxy at 3. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 3. That would make the aromatic protons a bit more complex. So the NMR would probably show more than two doublets. Hmm, maybe not the best fit.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONH2, but in this case, it's attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be OCH2CH2 attached to the benzene ring, and the formamide group. So the benzene substituents are OCH2CH3 and HCONR2? Wait, formamide is RCONH2. So the
