Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says: The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is θ=10^-17 degrees. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D with various exponents.

Wait, I remember that the event horizon's size relates to the mass of the black hole. And the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, right? The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, sometimes I see it as S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Yeah, that's probably it.

So, the first step must be to find the radius of the event horizon, then calculate the area, and then plug it into the entropy formula.

But wait, how do I find the radius from the angular size and distance? Oh right, angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance. So θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius of the event horizon.

But wait, the given θ is in degrees. Oh, right, I need to convert that to radians first because the formula uses radians.

So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, no, 1e-17 * (π/180) is approximately 1.745e-19, yes.

So R = θ_rad * d. But wait, what's the distance d? It's given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh, I need to convert that into meters because the standard units for the formula are in SI units.

One parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R ≈ θ_rad * d = (1.745e-19) * (3.086e26) meters.

Calculating that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 is about (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. Let me compute 1.745 * 3.086 approximately. 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, and 1.745 *0.086 ≈ 0.150. So total around 5.385. So R ≈ 5.385e7 meters. So about 5.4e7 meters.

Wait, but is that right? Because the event horizon radius for a black hole is given by R = 2 G M / c². Oh right, so R = 2GM/(c²). So once I have R, I can find M, but maybe I don't need to since the entropy depends on R squared.

Wait, the entropy formula S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), and A is the area of the event horizon, which is 4π R². So S = (4π R² c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) → simplifies to (π R² c^3)/( ħ G k_B).

So maybe I can compute R first, then plug it into the entropy equation.

So let me proceed step by step.

First, compute θ_rad.

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees → θ_rad = 1e
