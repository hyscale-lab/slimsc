Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products A and B from the given reactions. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+. I remember that BuLi is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Also, when there's an enol ether structure involved, like here, it might undergo some kind of conjugate addition or maybe a more specific reaction.

Wait, the starting material is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw its structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is a CH2-O- group attached to another group which is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Let me see: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait. But it's but-2-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-? Or maybe I have it wrong. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? No, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but starting from the first carbon. Wait, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So, the substituent is from the first carbon: so but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but connected where? Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. Hmm, maybe I should write it down.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The molecule is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So the benzene has a substituent which is a methylene group (CH2) attached to an oxygen, which is attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no. Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the benzene has a CH2-O-R group, where R is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let me clarify R: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So 3-methyl would be a methyl on the 3rd carbon of that chain. So R is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me number: for but-2-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- but the substituent is on the 3rd carbon, which would be the third carbon from the 1-yl position.

Wait, perhaps it's like this: the R group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure of R is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- group. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached at the first carbon. So the substituent is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CH2-Ph? No, wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl) benzene, so it's benzene connected to CH2-O- group, which is connected to the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl.

So the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, perhaps the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy, so it's O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the reaction itself.

BuLi is a strong base. When it's added to an enol ether, it can deprotonate the alpha position. Wait, but in this case, the substituent is an enol ether, so Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? So the enol ether is the structure where the oxygen is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH3) and then a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl, which is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the full structure would be Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2? Wait, no. Let me think again: but-2-en-1-yl has four carbons, with the double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-
