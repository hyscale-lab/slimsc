Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but I'll try to think this through.

Alright, the given phase shifts are delta_0 = 90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, and delta_4=13 degrees. And we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond delta_4, so I guess that means higher l values are zero, but I'm not sure how that plays into this.

I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) in the context of partial waves is given by a sum over all the angular momentum states. The formula involves the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. But wait, the problem is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which would be when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees. Because the incident direction is along the beam, so θ=0. 

Wait, but when θ is 0, the direction of the outgoing electron is the same as the incoming. So the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is... I think that's when the electrons are just going straight through without any deflection. But that's more about the process, not the calculation.

I recall that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as a sum over l of (2l+1) * e^{2iδ_l} * (something with Legendre polynomials). Oh right, the formula is f(θ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, for the imaginary part, maybe I should consider the imaginary components of each term.

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam, so θ=0. So I'll plug θ=0 into the formula. Let's see what P_l(1) is because cos(0) is 1. Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So each term simplifies to (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} * 1.

So the scattering amplitude f(0) is the sum from l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}, since higher l's are zero. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part. So I can compute the imaginary part by taking the imaginary part of f(0).

So f(0) = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l}.

Let me compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part.

Each term is (2l+1)*e^{i(2δ_l)}, because e^{2iδ} = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ). So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l).

So the total imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l).

But wait, the phase shifts are
