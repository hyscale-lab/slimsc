Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a carbon with four different substituents. Or maybe it's a meso compound situation?

Wait, no, meso compounds are not chiral because they have a plane of symmetry. So even if they have stereogenic centers, they're achiral. So I need to check each compound if it has a chiral center or not. Let me go through each one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CH... Wait, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C=CH2-CH3? Wait no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So structure is Cl-CH2-C=CH2? No, wait. Let me draw it:

Structure: C1 is Cl, double bond between C1 and C2, and C2 has a methyl group. So the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, no. Wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene would have four carbons, double bond between 1 and 2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, that would make the molecule CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, no, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl instead of CH2. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between 1 and 2. Oh wait, wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH
