Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Hmm, let's break it down.

The planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, and 5 units. I'm not sure what the units are, but maybe they're arbitrary since we're dealing with ratios.

The question is about equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T0 * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T0 is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's semi-major axis. But wait, another version I saw was T = T0 * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but maybe that's when considering luminosity. Oh wait, another formula is T = T0 * ( (1 - albedo) / (2) )^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ). Since all planets have the same albedo, that term is the same for all, so it cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes.

Wait, but how do their orbital periods relate to their semi-major axes? Oh right, Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So a³ is proportional to P². Therefore, a is proportional to P^(2/3). 

So the semi-major axis a is proportional to P^(2/3). So for each planet, a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant.

So to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, I can compute a4 / a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). 

Wait, but the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is (T4 / T2) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), T4/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4).

So let's plug in the periods. P4 is 3.5 and P2 is 2. So a4 = (3.5)^(2/3) * k, a2 = (2)^(2/3) *k.

So the ratio a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let's compute that. 3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. So (1.75)^(2/3). 

Hmm, what's 1.75 to the power of 2/3? Let me think. 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Alternatively, since 7/4 is 1.75. Let me compute the cube root of 1.75 first, then square it.

Alternatively, calculate the exponent 2/3. Let's approximate. 1.75 is between 1.5 (which is cube root of about 3.375) and 2 (cube root of 8). Wait, no, I'm mixing up. The cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2 (since 1.2^3 = 1.728, which is close to 1.75). So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2. Then squaring that gives 1.44. So a4/a2 is approximately 1.44.

Wait, wait. No, I'm getting confused. a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me calculate:

Take natural logarithm: ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.373. Then exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.452. So approximately 1.45.

So a4 is about 1.45 times a2.

Now, the temperature ratio is T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt(1 / 1.45) ≈ sqrt(0.6897) ≈ 0.8306.

Wait, so that's about 0.83. So the ratio is approximately 0.83, which would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, no. Wait, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4 = T0 * (1/sqrt(a4)), and T2 = T0 * (1/sqrt(a2)). So the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(a2 / a4).

Yes, because (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2/a4).

So if a4/a2 is ~1.45, then a2/a4 is ~0.6897. The square root of that is about 0.83.

So the options are A) ~0.57, B) ~0.69, C) ~0.83, D) ~0.75.

So the correct answer would be C) ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{a} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Thus, the temperature ratio \( T_4 / T_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}}
\]

From Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto P^2 \), so \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes \( a_4 / a_2 \) is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Given \( P_4 = 3.5 \) and \( P_2 = 2 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}
\]

Approximating \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we find it is approximately 1.45. Thus:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.45}} \approx \sqrt{0.6897} \approx 0.83
\]

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83, corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
