Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Interesting, because I remember that wave functions can have real and imaginary parts, but the square of the absolute value gives the probability density.

The key point is that when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, no, the wave function isn't necessarily zero; the probability of finding the particle outside is zero. So the probability density must be zero for x <1 and x>3. But wait, the wave function is given as (a/(sqrt(1+x))) -0.5i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the question says the wave function is that expression in a part of space where it can exist. Oh, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So outside, it's zero, or perhaps it's not considered here.

Wait, the question states that when measuring, none were found outside 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. So the given wave function is valid only between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the given expression is for x between 1 and 3.

But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function, which is fine. But wait, the wave function must satisfy normalization. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1. Because the total probability is 1.

So the probability density is |ψ|². Let's compute that. ψ = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i. So ψ = A + B i, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5. So |ψ|² is (A)^2 + (B)^2. Because for a complex number, |a + ib|² is a² + b².

So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25). Because (-0.5i) squared is (0.25), but wait, no, the square of the imaginary part is (0.5)^2, so 0.25.

Wait, no, |ψ|² = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because the imaginary part is -0.5i, so its magnitude is 0.5. So the square of that is 0.25.

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but the wave function should be normalized. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ|^2 dx equals 1.

So:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me break that integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² * ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

Evaluated from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So sum is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Thus, a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the expression for |ψ|^2. Because ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, so ψ = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 is [a/(sqrt(1
