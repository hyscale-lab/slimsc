Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves certain operations like rotations and reflections. 

Wait, what's C3h symmetry? Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around that axis and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, another one with a long name, and another complex one. Let me think about each of them and their structures.

First, triisopropyl borate. I think its structure has three isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. Each isopropyl group is like a CH(CH3)2. So the molecule is symmetrical because all three substituents are the same. So the symmetry would be something like trigonal symmetry. But I'm not sure if it's C3h. Wait, the borate ion is [B(OCH(CH3)2)3]^−. The central boron has three identical groups. I think the molecule has a C3 axis but does it have a σh plane? Well, in such a trigonal planar structure, there are multiple σ planes. But wait, for C3h, we need a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, maybe the molecule is planar with a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's not because the groups are bulky isopropyl. Wait, no, the molecule is symmetric with a plane cutting through the boron and the middle of each isopropyl group, right? So maybe it does have a σh plane. So triisopropyl borate might have C3h symmetry.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, right? It's a norbornane derivative. The structure is a bridge with two rings. I remember that quinuclidine has a C3h symmetry. Or wait, no, maybe it's more like a C2 symmetry because it's bridge-shaped. Wait, I think when you look at quinuclidine, it has a three-dimensional structure with a bridge. The molecule has a three-fold rotation
