Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of reaction steps.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Let me draw this mentally: at position 3 is a bromine, and at position 5 is a nitro group. Additionally, the ethan-1-one group implies a ketone attached to the benzene. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, so the benzene is attached to a ketone (so like Ar-C(O)-CH3? Or wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but the way the compound is named, it's that the benzene is attached to the carbonyl group. So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached, and then ethanone would mean that the ketone is part of the ethyl chain. Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's a phenyl group attached to a ketone, specifically at the 1-position of ethan-1-one. So the structure would be Ar-C(=O)-CH3, where Ar is the substituted benzene.

So benzene is first converted into the substituted benzene with bromo and nitro groups, and then into a ketone. Or maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Wait, noâ€”wait, ethanone is a two-carbon chain with the ketone at the end. So the molecule is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to a carbonyl group, which is connected to a methyl group. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-CH3, where Ph is the 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl.

So the synthesis steps involve several substitutions on benzene and then introducing the ketone group. Now, the order of these substituents is crucial because of the directing effects of the groups.

I remember that when you have multiple substituents on a benzene ring, the order in which they are introduced affects
