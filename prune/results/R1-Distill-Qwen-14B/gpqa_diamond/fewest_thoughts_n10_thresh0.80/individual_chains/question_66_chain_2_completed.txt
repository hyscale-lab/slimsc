Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators in it must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that could appear at a higher energy scale beyond the Standard Model, but keeping the particle content the same as the SM.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, wait. Let me think about each symmetry. Lorentz symmetry—right, that's the symmetry of spacetime in special relativity, so any theory that respects relativity must have Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must have Lorentz symmetry because the SM does, and SMEFT is an effective theory built on top of it.

Poincare symmetry—oh, that includes Lorentz plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group. But wait, in effective field theories, the Poincare symmetry is part of the foundation. But wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it's Poincare-invariant as well. Because any term you add has to be local, right? So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare would have to be respected.

Wait, but what's the difference between options here. Option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So SMEFT includes higher-dimension operators beyond the SM, but they must still be consistent with the symmetries of the SM. So the SM already respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetry. Wait, does the SM respect CP? No, because CP violation is present in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, but wait, no—the terms in SMEFT must be invariant under the same symmetries as the SM, except for perhaps some terms that could be higher-dimension.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimension operators that are consistent with the SM symmetries. So the SM has certain symmetries, and all SMEFT operators must respect those. So the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare (since it's a relativistic theory), CPT symmetry? Wait, the SM is CPT symmetric. Because every particle has its antiparticle, and so on. So any operator added must respect CPT symmetry. But what about CP?

The SM doesn't have a global CP symmetry, and some terms can violate CP. For example, the strong CP problem is about theta term, but in the SM that's forbidden because of some symmetry. Anyway, the point is that operators in SMEFT don't have to preserve CP symmetry because the SM doesn't either. So SMEFT operators can have CP violation, but must they respect CPT?

Wait, CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM is CPT symmetric, I think. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry? Because the SM does, and SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM.

So putting it all together:

Which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect?

- Lorentz symmetry: Yes, because effective operators must be Lorentz-invariant.
- Poincare: Yes, because it's built into the framework of EFT; includes Lorentz and translations.
- CP: No, because SM doesn't require it. So operators can violate CP.
- CPT: Yes, because the SM is CPT symmetric, so operators must preserve CPT.

So the required symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would include 1,2,4. So option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that incorporates all possible interactions consistent with the Standard Model (SM) particle content, extended to include higher-dimension operators. These operators must respect the symmetries of the SM, as SMEFT is an effective theory built upon it.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is the symmetry of spacetime in special relativity and is fundamental to any relativistic theory. Since SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. As SMEFT is built using local operators, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not strictly respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is present (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM is CPT symmetric, as every particle has a corresponding antiparticle and the theory respects the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Consequently, all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is the combination of these three symmetries.

Answer: C
