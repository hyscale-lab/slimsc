Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

First, the question gives me some information about the two instruments. ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So that means any star with a V magnitude less than 17 is visible to ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is "brighter than 17 mag." Oh, but wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star that's brighter (lower magnitude number) than 17 would be visible. So, the apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO. Same for HIRES: it can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent V magnitude less than 16.

So the key thing is to find the apparent V magnitude of each star, and see which ones are below 17 for ESPRESSO and below 16 for HIRES. Or wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So both spectrographs should be able to see the star. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (because ESPRESSO can only go down to 17) and less than 16 (because HIRES can only go down to 16). Wait, no, wait: wait, the brighter the magnitude, the fainter the star. So for each instrument, the maximum apparent V magnitude they can observe is 17 for ESPRESSO and 16 for HIRES. So a star must be brighter than those limits to be detected.

So, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 (bright enough for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (bright enough for HIRES). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So that's apparent magnitude V < 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V <16.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than
