Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. So cyclohexan-1-one means a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl groupâ€”so that's a CH2OH attached. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl, right? So that's CH2-C(CH2)- with a double bond. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2) something? Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is the en-2-yl group, so it's CH2-C(CH2-). Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. No, wait, the formula is prop-1-en-2-yl. Oh, right, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent would be CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, maybe it's CH2-CH(CH2). No, wait. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C-CH2, but the substituent is at position 2. Wait, maybe I should draw it. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)= maybe? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on and see what each reaction does.

First reaction: treated with sodium hydride, then benzyl bromide to form product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation. In the presence of a ketone, perhaps it deprotonates a beta hydrogen to form an enolate. Then benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So the enolate would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to
