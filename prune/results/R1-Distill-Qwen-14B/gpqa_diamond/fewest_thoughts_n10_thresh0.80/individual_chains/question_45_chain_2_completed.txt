Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that particles in a 1D infinite well have quantized energy levels. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which I think is given here as E multiplied by n squared. Oh wait, the question defines E as π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy would be E multiplied by n². So for a particle in the nth state, energy is E * n².

But wait, these are four identical fermions, right? Because spin-1/2 particles are fermions, which obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n. But since they are spin-1/2, each has a spin quantum number s = 1/2, and the magnetic spin quantum number m_s can be +1/2 or -1/2. Oh right, so each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, let me think. For each n, you can have two particles in the same n but different spins. So for n=1, maximum two particles; n=2, another two, but wait, we have four particles here.

So the four particles will fill the lowest energy levels. Let's see: the ground state would have the lowest possible n's, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, in a 1D infinite well, each n can hold two particles (with spin up and down). So in the ground state, the four particles would occupy the lowest available n's.

So for four particles, the filling would be n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2. Wait no, wait, each n can hold two particles. So n=1 has two, n=2 has two. That's four. But wait, in a 1D well, each n is a single state, but with spin, each can hold two. So four particles would fill n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no, wait a second. Each state is specified by both n and spin. So the first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two go into n=2, each with opposite spins. So the total energy would be 2*(E*1²) + 2*(E*2²) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, wait, no, because each particle contributes E*(n²). So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(E*1) + 2*(E*4) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? But looking at the options, option C's ground state is 4E, which is lower than 10E. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the way the levels are filled. Let me think again. Each energy level n can hold two particles because of spin. So the four particles would fill the first two levels, n=1 and n=2, with two in each. So the energy would be (2 * E*1²) + (2 * E*2²) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state of the system would have energy 10E. But looking at the options, option B's ground state is 4E, option C has 4E as the ground state. So that suggests I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, in a 1D well, each state is defined by n, but for fermions, each n can hold two electrons because of spin. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spin), the next two go into n=2 (opposite spins). So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state of the system (all four particles) would have energy 10E. But looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, which is much lower. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, wait, maybe the particles are not all in the same state, but perhaps the question is about the system's total energy. Wait no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system". So the system's energy is the sum of individual energies.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in how the particles can be arranged. Maybe the system's ground state has the lowest possible energy, which would be when each particle is in the lowest possible states, but considering that each state can hold two particles.

Wait, wait I think I'm confusing the particles. Each particle must have a unique quantum state, which includes n and spin. So the first two particles go into n=1 with opposite spins. The next two can't go into n=1 anymore, so they go into n=2 with opposite spins. So the total energy is (2 * E*1) + (2 * E*4) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the system's ground state energy is 10E.

But the options don't have that as an option for the ground state. Wait, let me look again. Option B says ground state is 4E, first excited is 10E, second excited 50E. Option C says ground state 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E. Hmm, that 10E is in higher states.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. Maybe each particle is in the same n but different spin? No, for identical fermions, each state must be unique. So in the ground state, the four particles would have n=1, n=1 with opposite spins, n=2, n=2 with opposite spins. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E.

But looking at the options, option B's ground state is 4E, which doesn't fit. So perhaps the question is about the single-particle energies, not the sum? No, the question says the energies of the system's states.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the spin part. Maybe in a 1D well, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers (n and spin). So n can be any integer, and spin can be ±1/2. So each n can hold two particles. So for four particles, we need two n's, each holding two particles. So n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the sum is 2E + 8E=10E.

But the options don’t have 10E as the ground state. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Oh wait, maybe the energy is calculated per particle, but the question says the "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system". So the system's total energy for each state.

Wait, that's what I thought. So the ground state is 10E.

But looking at the options, none of the options have the ground state as 10E. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E, 50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, so option B's ground state is 4E, which is lower than 10E. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the possibility that all four can be in the same n? But no, because of Pauli exclusion. Each n can hold only two particles (because of spin). So four particles must occupy n=1 and n=2.

Wait, is there a way to have lower energy? Let me think. For four particles, the first two go into n=1 with spins up and down. The next two must go into higher states. The next available is n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

So the ground state of the system is 10E. Then, looking at the options, which option has the ground state as 10E? Let's check:

Option D: 10,15,18.

So the ground state is 10E. Then, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next higher state.

Wait, how does the first excited state look? So the current ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state would involve moving the highest occupied particle to the next available state. So the particles in n=2 are the highest. We can move one of them to n=3. But wait, since each n can hold two particles, maybe the system's configuration can be such that more particles are promoted.

Wait, no. Let me think. To find the first excited state, perhaps the system has three particles in the lowest possible states, but that may not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state would have one of the n=2 particles promoted to n=3. So the configuration would be n=1: 2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

Wait, but each n can hold two particles. So if n=2 is already filled with two, perhaps we can't promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 without first having an empty spot in n=2. Wait, no, because Pauli's exclusion allows that. Let me try to think about the possible allowed states.

In the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). The first excited state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So now, the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Each of these n's can have two particles, but in this case, n=2 has only one left because one has moved to n=3. Wait, but why would that be the case? Because you can promote a particle from n=2 to n=3, leaving n=2 with only one, but then you have an empty spot. Oh, but another particle could come into that spot, but since all four are already in the first two n's, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. Let me approach it step by step.

In the ground state, all four particles are in the lowest possible n's, considering the Pauli exclusion. So the four particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two), since each n can hold two.

Now, when we go to the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied n (n=2) to the next higher n (n=3). So the configuration becomes n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the total energy is (2 * 1) + (1 *4) + (1 *9) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but wait, no. Each particle's energy is E multiplied by n squared. So 2 particles in n=1 contribute 2E each? No, each contributes E*(1^2) = E. So two particles contribute 2E. Similarly, 1 particle in n=2 contributes E*(2^2) =4E, and 1 in n=3 contributes 9E. So total is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

So the first excited state would have energy 15E.

Wait, but let me think again. The ground state was 10E, and the first excited state is 15E. So looking at the options, which option has ground state 10E and first excited 15E?

Looking at option D: 10E, 15E, 18E. That fits. So the second excited state would be the next possible configuration.

What's the second excited state? That would be when two particles are promoted from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration would be n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2.

Wait, but that can't be because each n must be filled up to two. Let me think. Alternatively, moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but in the first excited state, we already have n=3:1, n=2:1. So if another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, n=3 would have 2, but then n=2 would have 0. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. The total energy is (2*1) + (0*4) + (2*9) → 2E +0 + 18E=20E.

Wait, but that's higher than 15E, so the second excited state would be 20E. But looking at the options, option D's second state is 18E. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another from n=2 to n=3 as well. But that would make two in n=3 and zero in n=2. So the total energy would be 2E (from n=1) plus 0 (from n=2) plus 2*9E=18E. So sum is 20E, but in the options, 18E is present.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another configuration. Let me think about other possible configurations.

Another possibility for the first excited state: perhaps promoting one particle from n=1 to n=2, but that would require another particle being promoted as well. Wait, but n=2 is already filled with two particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, but that would require four particles in n=3, which can't happen because each n can hold two. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the particles are arranged in excited states. Let me think again.

The ground state is 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2: total energy 10E.

First excited state: promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Total energy 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: promote another particle from n=2 to n=3. Now n=2:0, n=3:2. So total energy 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, the second excited state in option D is 18E. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is achieved by a different configuration. Let me consider another scenario. Maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3 and another to n=4. But that would make the energy higher. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when a particle is promoted to n=3, leaving n=2 with one, and another promotion occurs elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible energies.

If the ground state is 10E, the first excited is 15E, the second excited would be 20E. But none of the options have this. So perhaps my initial assumption about the ground state is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm considering the wrong spin states. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the particles are bosons? No, the question says spin-1/2, so they are fermions, obeying Pauli exclusion.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the system in the wrong way. Let's think about the possible states the four particles can occupy.

Each particle is in a state (n, s), where s is spin up or down. So for n=1, two particles: (1, up) and (1, down). For n=2, two particles: (2, up) and (2, down). So the total energy is 2E + 8E =10E.

Now, for the first excited state, one of the particles must move to a higher n. Let's say one particle from n=2 moves to n=3. So now, the configuration is (n=1, 2 particles), (n=2, 1 particle), (n=3, 1 particle). So the energy is 2E + 4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3. Now, n=2 has 0, n=3 has 2. So the energy is 2E + 0 + 18E =20E. But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when another particle is promoted differently. Maybe from n=1 to n=3. Let's see: n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. So the energies are (1E) + (4E *2) + (9E *1)= E +8E +9E=18E. So the total energy would be 18E.

Wait, that would make the second excited state 18E. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. So the sequence would be 10E, 15E, 18E. Which matches option D.

Wait, but how does that configuration look? Let me describe it:

In the ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles).

First excited state: promote one n=2 → n=3. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Energy 15E.

Second excited state: promote another n=2 → n=3. Now, n=2:0, n=3:2. But then the energy is 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 18E (n=3) =20E. Hmm, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when a particle from n=1 is promoted to n=3, while another remains. So n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. That gives 1E +8E +9E=18E.

So the question is, what's the energy ordering here? Let me list the possible energies:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 18E.

Option D gives 10,15,18. So that would be the correct option.

But let me make sure that this configuration is the next possible state. Because another possibility is moving two particles from n=2 to n=3, but that would require a higher energy (20E), which is more than 18E. So the 18E configuration would come before 20E.

Wait, but why is the 18E configuration considered the second excited state?

Because in the first excited state, you promote one particle to n=3, making the energy 15E. Then, the next possible state is to promote another particle to n=3, making the energy 20E, but that's higher than another possible state where a particle is promoted from n=1 to n=3, which would be lower in energy.

Wait, no. Promoting a particle from n=1 to a higher n would increase the energy more than keeping it in n=1. So moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would require more energy than moving from n=2.

Wait, but why would you promote a particle from n=1? Because in the ground state, all the lowest possible states are filled. So the first available promotion is from the highest filled state, which is n=2.

So the first excited state is when a particle from n=2 moves to n=3, giving 15E. The next possible would be promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3, giving 20E. But 20E is higher than 18E, which comes from a different configuration.

Hm, perhaps I'm getting confused about the possible configurations. Let me think of all possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, each in unique (n, spin) states.

Possible configurations:

1. All four in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy 10E.

2. One in n=3, others in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy 15E.

3. Two in n=3, others in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Energy 20E.

4. Alternatively, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4, and others in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3, 1 in n=4. But wait, that requires five particles, so not applicable.

Wait, but for four particles, perhaps another configuration is possible: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. That would have energy 1E + 8E + 9E =18E.

Wait, but how is that possible? Because in the ground state, the four particles are in n=1 and n=2. So how does the system reach 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3? That would require one particle to be promoted from n=1 to n=3, which would increase the energy by more than just promoting from n=2.

Wait, but in the ground state, n=1 is filled with two. So to have one in n=1, you'd have to have another promoted. Hmm, but that's impossible because you can't have a half-filled state in n=1 if you're starting from the ground state.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the ordering. Let me think about the energies:

The possible system energies are:

a) 10E (ground state).

b) 15E (first excited state, one particle promoted to n=3).

c) 18E (another configuration where a particle is promoted from n=1, but that's higher energy? Or is it a lower energy than promoting from n=2 twice?)

Wait, 15E is less than 18E. So the first excited state is 15E, the next would be 18E, then 20E.

So the options D:10,15,18.

But why is 18E the second excited state? Because it's the next lowest energy state after 15E.

Wait, perhaps the configuration with 18E is higher in energy than the configuration where two particles are promoted to n=3 (20E), which would be higher than 18E. So the order would be 10E, then 15E, then 18E. So option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Looking back at the options, option D is '10E,15E,18E', which matches.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in the Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy of a single particle in the nth state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   Each energy level \( n \) can accommodate two particles due to the two possible spin states (\(+1/2\) and \(-1/2\)).

2. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the four particles fill the lowest available energy levels, considering the Pauli exclusion principle. The configuration is:  
   - Two particles in \( n=1 \) (each with opposite spins).  
   - Two particles in \( n=2 \) (each with opposite spins).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E(1^2) + 2E(2^2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

3. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:  
   - Two particles in \( n=1 \).  
   - One particle in \( n=2 \).  
   - One particle in \( n=3 \).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E(1^2) + 1E(2^2) + 1E(3^2) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

4. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:  
   - Two particles in \( n=1 \).  
   - Zero particles in \( n=2 \).  
   - Two particles in \( n=3 \).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E(1^2) + 0E(2^2) + 2E(3^2) = 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E.
   \]  
   However, another possible configuration for the second excited state involves promoting one particle from \( n=1 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in:  
   - One particle in \( n=1 \).  
   - Two particles in \( n=2 \).  
   - One particle in \( n=3 \).  
   The total energy for this configuration is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 1E(1^2) + 2E(2^2) + 1E(3^2) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
   \]  
   This configuration is lower in energy than the fully promoted configuration (20E) and is therefore considered the second excited state.

5. **Energy Ordering**:  
   The energy levels of the system are:  
   - Ground state: \( 10E \).  
   - First excited state: \( 15E \).  
   - Second excited state: \( 18E \).  

6. **Matching with Options**:  
   The correct option is:  
   **D) 10E, 15E, 18E.**

Answer: D
