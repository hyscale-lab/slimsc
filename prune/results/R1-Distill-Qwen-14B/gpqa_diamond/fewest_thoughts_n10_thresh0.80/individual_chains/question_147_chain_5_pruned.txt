Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, wait, the question says the antiproton is moving slowly. And the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Annihilation usually involves matter and antimatter particles converting into energy, right? Like when an electron and a positron annihilate, they produce gamma rays. But here, it's a proton and an antiproton annihilating, and producing two particles each of type A⁺ and A⁻.

Wait, but wait. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So their rest masses are the same, right? The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², so the antiproton is the same. So the total rest mass energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV, but they must be annihilating and creating these A particles.

But the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe it's a low-energy process. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that affects things.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So maybe the total energy of the system is approximately the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. Because if the antiproton's velocity is low, its kinetic energy is small, so we can approximate the total energy as just their rest energies.

So the proton is at rest, I think. Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can consider the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. Or wait, wait, no—maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, the wording says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps in the lab frame, the antiproton's velocity is low. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it, but not too fast.

But wait, when they annihilate, they produce these particles A. The products are two A⁺ and two A⁻. So four particles in total.

Wait, but what's the mass of A? The question says m_A c² is 300 MeV
