--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. Oh right, it's about titration and calculating pH at certain points. I remember that titration involves neutralizing a solution with a base, and finding out the pH at specific stages. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward. The Ka given is 1.85x10^-5. I remember that when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is where the moles of base equal the moles of acid. But at the equivalence point, the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it'll be basic because the conjugate base can hydrolyze.

First, let me think about the initial dilution. Oh wait, when we add equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the concentration will be halved. Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant. So initial concentration is 0.05 M. Diluting same volume (20 cm³ each), so new concentration is 0.025 M. Right, because M1V1 = M2V2. 0.05 * 20 = M2 * 40 => M2 = 0.025 M.

Now, for the titration part. Let's handle the two parts separately: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Starting with 25% titration. So, 25% of the required NaOH to reach equivalence point is added. Wait, what's the equivalence point in terms of moles?

Wait, let's compute the moles of acetic acid initially. Volume is 40 cm³ (since 20 + 20), but wait no, wait. Wait, no. After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, but the moles of acetic acid are the same as the initial 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Because when you dilute, concentration changes, but the amount of substance doesn't.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. The initial moles of acetic acid in 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then we dilute with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) water, making total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, as I thought earlier.

When titrating with NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH. Moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Let me compute the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So since the reaction is 1:1, we've neutralized 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH. So remaining moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ion produced: 0.00025 moles.

So the solution now contains 0.00075 moles of CH3COOH and 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^- in a total volume of 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and each addition adds to the volume. So when you add 2.5 cm³, the total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

So the concentrations are:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, but to be precise, let's calculate it.

Wait, 0.00075 / 0.0425: let me compute that.

0.00075 = 7.5e-4. 0.0425 = 4.25e-2.

7.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (7.5 / 4.25) * 1e-2 = approximately 1.7647 * 0.01 = 0.017647 M.

Similarly, 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 2.5e-4 / 4.25e-2 = (2.5 /4.25) * 1e-2 ≈ 0.5882 * 0.01 = 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, wait. pKa = -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa is 4.73).

Wait, let me compute it accurately. Ka = 1.85e-5.

log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So pKa = 4.73.

So [A^-] is 0.005882 M, [HA] is 0.017647 M.

So ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253.

Wait, about 4.25. Looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So at 25% titration, the pH is around 4.26, which matches option A's first value. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio.

Wait, 0.00075 and 0.00025.

The ratio is (moles of A^-)/(moles of HA) = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3, which is 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253, which is about 4.25. So option A says 4.26 as the first value. So that part fits, but let's check the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point is determined by the moles of acetate divided by the total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles (since all the acetic acid was neutralized).

Total volume: original 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ NaOH added (since 10 cm³ is equivalence point). So 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

But wait, the acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So in water, it will react: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.4054e-10.

Wait, let me compute that: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

Now, since the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, which is not very high, but let's proceed. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Let x be the [OH^-] produced.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.486.

So pH = 14 - 5.486 ≈ 8.514.

Wait, so pH is around 8.51, which is close to 8.52. Looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value. But wait, the options say:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Option D) 4.57; 6.92

Wait, but according to my previous calculation, at equivalence point, pH is around 8.51, which matches option A.

But earlier, at 25% titration, I thought the pH was ~4.25, which is close to option A's first value.

Hmm, but wait. Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.00025 mol, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the total volume. Wait, when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution, the total is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M.

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333. So log(1/3) is about -0.477.

pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. So that's 4.25, but option A says 4.26. Close enough.

But wait, the options for the equivalence point don't have 8.52 except option A.

Wait, but wait, the initial solution after adding 20 cm³ water is 40 cm³, but when adding NaOH, the volumes are additive.

Wait, another way: Let me recompute the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added is 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH is 10 cm³, so total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So Kb is 5.405e-10, as before.

Using Kb expression:

Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486 → pH = 14 -5.486 = 8.514, which is about 8.51.

So, the pH at equivalence point is around 8.51. So in the options, option A has 8.52, which is very close.

So, the pH at 25% is 4.25, and at equivalence point 8.51. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.57, 6.92, which doesn't match.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the 25% calculation?

Let me recheck.

Wait, 25% titration refers to 25% of the volume required to reach equivalence point. So volume of NaOH at 25% is 2.5 cm³, as earlier.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

Concentration of CH3COOH: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Henderson: pH = pKa + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ) → pKa is 4.73.

0.005882 / 0.017647 is 0.3333, so log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. So it's about 4.26 when rounded to two decimal places. So yes, option A's first value is 4.26.

But wait, the options don't have both 4.26 and 8.52 except option A.

Wait, but the given options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So option A has both values. So why is option D an option? Maybe I did a mistake in calculations.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the pH at 25% titration again, perhaps using the exact method without the Henderson-Hasselbalch.

At 25% titration, we have some excess CH3COOH and some conjugate base.

The solution consists of CH3COOH and CH3COO^-.

The exact pH can be calculated by considering the dissociation of the weak acid and the salt.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute using the buffer equation accurately.

Wait, when you have a buffer, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is accurate, so I think my approach was correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.

So moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol, correct.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, we have 0.00075 moles of CH3COOH and 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^-.

The total volume is 42.5 cm³.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log (n_A-/n_HA)

Because the concentrations are in the same solution, so ratio is same as moles ratio.

n_A-/n_HA = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.

Which would round to 4.25 or 4.26. So 4.26 is option A.

So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26, and at equivalence point, 8.52.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is the only one with 4.26 as the first value and 8.52 as the second.

But wait, another thought: the initial solution is 40 cm³. Then when we add 2.5 cm³, the total is 42.5 cm³.

Wait, let me compute the exact pH using the dissociation approach.

The solution has CH3COOH (0.00075 mol) and CH3COO^- (0.00025 mol) in 0.0425 L.

Let me compute the exact pH.

The reaction in solution is:

CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-

Initial concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Let’s denote the change as x: some CH3COO^- will react with water to form CH3COOH and OH^-.

Wait, no, wait: in the solution, the acetate ion can react with water. Alternatively, the acetic acid can dissociate. The buffer is a mixture of both.

But perhaps using the Henderson-Hasselbalch is more straightforward and accurate, as the buffer equation is derived for such cases.

So I think my earlier calculation is correct.

Thus, the pH at 25% is 4.26 and at equivalence point 8.52, which is option A.

But wait, the options given don't include that. Wait, no, option A is there. So why is the option D even present?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, at equivalence point, the solution is a 0.02 M solution of acetate ions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH more accurately.

Let me compute [OH^-] again.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x²/(0.02 - x).

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, which it is because Kb is so small (order 1e-10), so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 3.288e-6.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) = log(1/(3.288e-6)) = log(3.046e5) ≈ ?

Wait, wait, no. pOH is -log[OH^-].

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486.

pH = 14 -5.486 = 8.514, which is about 8.51.

So, the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.51, which corresponds to option A's second value of 8.52.

So, the only option that has both these values is option A.

Wait, but the options don't have any other option with these values except option A.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, 20 cm³ of water is added. So the volume is 40 cm³, and the concentration is 0.025 M. Correct.

But when you add 25% of the NaOH volume needed for equivalence point, which is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the 25% refers to 25% of the moles of acetic acid.

But no, the question says 25% titration, which means 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence point has been added. So the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Let me check that.

Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in some cases, people use pKa = -log(Ka), which is correct.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.73.

So yes, that's correct.

So, unless I made a mistake in the initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, initial moles: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So, I think my calculations are correct, which would make option A the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for buffer solution.

The exact pH calculation for a buffer can be done using the equation:

pH = pKa + log( (n_A^-)/(n_HA) )

Which is what I did, so I think I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that after adding NaOH, the volume is not just 42.5 cm³. Because the NaOH solution's volume adds to the solution.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the exact concentrations.

After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH:

Moles of NaOH = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

Which converts 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So, initial moles after dilution: CH3COOH = 0.001 mol.

After reaction: CH3COOH = 0.00075 mol; CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So, [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Then, pH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647 ) → pKa is 4.73.

0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) = -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 → 4.25.

So, 4.25 rounds to 4.26, which is option A.

Hmm, so unless I made a mistake in the Henderson equation, which I don't think I did, option A should be the correct answer.

But wait, looking at the options again, option A is the only one with 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. The key steps are as follows:

---

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid**:  
   The problem states 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.  
   Moles of acetic acid = \( 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Dilution with Water**:  
   After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L} \).  
   The new concentration of acetic acid is:  
   \[
   \text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
   \]

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point has been added.  

1. **Volume of NaOH Added**:  
   The equivalence point requires \( 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \) of \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \) NaOH (calculated later).  
   At 25%, the volume of NaOH added is:  
   \[
   0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
   \]

2. **Moles of NaOH Added**:  
   Moles of NaOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Reaction with Acetic Acid**:  
   The reaction is \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
   At 25% titration, \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \) is neutralized, forming \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \).  
   Remaining moles of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \):  
   \[
   0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Buffer Solution**:  
   The solution now contains \( 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \) and \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \).  
   Total volume = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L} \).  
   Concentrations:  
   \[
   [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **pH at 25% Titration**:  
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right).
   \]  
   Given \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \).  
   Ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 4.73 + \log(0.3333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
   \]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \) is neutralized to \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \).  

1. **Moles of Acetate Ion**:  
   Moles of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \) = \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Total Volume**:  
   Total volume = \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L} \).  
   Concentration of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \):  
   \[
   [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
   \]

3. **pH at Equivalence Point**:  
   The solution is basic due to the hydrolysis of \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \):  
   \[
   \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
   \]  
   \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \).  
   Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Then:  
   \[
   K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
   \]  
   Solving:  
   \[
   x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
   \]  
   \[
   [\text{OH}^-] = 3.29 \times 10^{-6}, \quad \text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 = 8.514 \approx 8.52.
   \]
