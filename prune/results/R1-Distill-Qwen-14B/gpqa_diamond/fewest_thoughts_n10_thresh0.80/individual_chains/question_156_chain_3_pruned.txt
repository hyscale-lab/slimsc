Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist performs two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both reactions go to 100% completion. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The question is about what the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation involves adding an oxygen across the double bond to form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the structure of the epoxide.

So, in both reactions, oct-4-ene (either E or Z) is reacting with mCPBA. Let me think about what happens in each case.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The E geometry means the two higher priority groups are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. Since the starting alkene is E, the epoxidation will result in a trans epoxide. Wait, no, wait. Wait, mCPBA adds in a way that forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because the peracid adds across the double bond in a conjugated fashion, the epoxide that forms will have the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So, E-alkene gives a trans epoxide.

Wait, but wait. Let me get that right. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen bonds are on the same face. So for an E-alkene, the substituents on each carbon are opposite. When the epoxide forms, the oxygen adds across the same face or opposite? Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide via a cyclic transition state, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is retained. So the E-alkene becomes a trans epoxide. Similarly, the Z-alkene becomes a cis epoxide.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When mCPBA adds to an alkene, it adds an oxygen across the double bond, and the peracid attacks from the same face. So the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is preserved because the two R groups that were on the same face (for Z) end up on the same side in the epoxide, leading to a cis epoxide. For E, the substituents were opposite, so the epoxide would have the substituents on opposite sides, making a trans epoxide.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try drawing it. Imagine oct-4-ene. The structure is CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. For (E
