Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me the concentrations of Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I need to remember what these stability constants mean. Oh right, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable it is.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2−n, where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So the blue dithiocyanato complex must be the one with two SCN- ions. Oh, wait, but wait—what's the color associated with each complex? I think the color changes with the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)]^2+ might be one color, and [Co(SCN)2]^0 another, and so on. But the question specifically mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that's [Co(SCN)2]^2+? Or maybe it's another one. Oh wait, in the options, they're asking about the percentage of the blue ones, which might correspond to a specific complex, probably the one with n=2 or n=4? Hmm, but maybe I should figure out first what each β corresponds to.

Wait, the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for each n, the beta increases up to a point. Let me think: β1 is for the first complex, probably [CoSCN]^2+? Let's clarify:

The general formation reaction is Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}. The stability constant βn is equal to [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So, for each n, βn is given. So:

n=1: β1=9 → [CoSCN]^+.
n=2: β2=40 → [Co(SCN)2]^0? Because 2-2=0 charge.
n=3: β3=63 → [Co(SCN)3]^-.
n=4: β4=16 → [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

Wait, but wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. So the third complex has a higher stability constant than the fourth. Interesting.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ions. So that would be the complex with n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution.

Wait, but why is
