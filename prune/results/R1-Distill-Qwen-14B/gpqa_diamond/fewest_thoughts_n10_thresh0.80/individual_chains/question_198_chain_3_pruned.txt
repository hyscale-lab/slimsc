Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem states that there's a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it forms more readily. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is the number of SCN^- ligands.

Wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the dithiocyanato would be when n=2, so Co(SCN)_2^2+ is the complex in question. But I'm not entirely sure; I should double-check. The problem mentions the 'blue dithiocyanato' which I believe is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So, the species we're interested in is Co(SCN)_2^2+.

The goal is to find the percentage of this specific complex relative to all possible Co species. So, I probably need to calculate the concentrations of each possible Co complex and then find the ratio of the desired one.

The possible complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. Wait, but wait: the stability constants provided are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. But wait, sometimes the stability constants are given for each step. Let me think: the overall formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ would have a stepwise formation constant for each SCN added.

Wait, the stability constants (β) are the formation constants for each successive addition. So, β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc
