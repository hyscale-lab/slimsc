Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this.

I remember that the interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula derived from the crystal's lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal crystal system, the lattice isn't cubic, so the formula probably includes the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / √(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ), right? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Oh wait, no, I think it's d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ). Or was it plus the cosine terms? I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: For a cubic crystal (like simple cubic), the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But when the angles aren't 90 degrees, like in a rhombohedral, we have to adjust for the angles between the lattice vectors.

Rhombohedral systems have all edges equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (α = β = γ). So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and each angle is 30 degrees.

So the formula for interplanar distance when the lattice is rhombohedral must account for these angles. Let me try to recall the formula correctly. Oh right, it's d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but wait, that can't be right because when angles are 90 degrees, cos 90 is zero, and it reduces to the cubic formula. So maybe the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but wait no, that doesn't seem right because in the cubic case, cos 90 is zero, and the denominator becomes sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct. But wait
