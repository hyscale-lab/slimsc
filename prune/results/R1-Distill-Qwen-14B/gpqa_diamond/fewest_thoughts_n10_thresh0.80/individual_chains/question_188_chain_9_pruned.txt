Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, right? So that's a type of crystal structure where all the lattice parameters are equal, but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees. Oh yeah, and the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance... so that's the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice. But in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice constant 'a' is the same for all axes, I think.

So, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, and c are all equal, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal too. So here, each angle is 30 degrees. So I can model this crystal with a cubic-like structure but with angles of 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance for a plane with Miller indices (hkl) is given by the formula: d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * ( (1 - cos^2 alpha)/(sin^2 alpha) ) ) ) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I
