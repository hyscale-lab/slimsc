Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, the target molecule. The name suggests there's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group, and the main chain also has a carbonyl (aldehyde) group. Wait, no, let me look at the name again. 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So that substituent is a CH2 group where one H is replaced by a hydroxyl (OH) and the other by a cyclohexyl group.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so it's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group—maybe like C6H11-C≡CH? So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an acetylene substituent.

I need to convert that into the target. Let me think about the steps involved. The target has a benzaldehyde-like structure, so maybe oxidation is needed. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. How can I get from there to an aldehyde?

Let's think about possible reactions. One approach is to functionalize the triple bond. Maybe adding a group, then oxidizing, or hydrogenating.

Wait, another thing: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl. So perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol, and then some kind of aldehyde is formed.

Let me outline possible steps.

1. Ethynylcyclohexane: perhaps first deprotonate the alkyne to form a strong base. NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate terminal alkynes. If I use NaNH2 and methyl chloride (CH3Cl), maybe an alkylation occurs. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, so deprotonating with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexenide (a cyclohexyl lithium or something similar?), but methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated to form a lithium acetylide, then methylated. Wait, but wait: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne. So deprotonating with NaNH2 in liquid ammonia would give the acetylide ion. Then, adding methyl chloride would methylate the acetylide? Wait, but methyl chloride is a primary alkylating agent. So maybe the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, leading to a gem-dimethyl group? Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡C-CH2-C6H11? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. So deprotonating that gives C6H11-C≡C^-Li^+. Then, methyl chloride would methylate that. So adding CH3Cl would give C6H11-C≡C-CH2Cl? But that doesn't seem right because CH3Cl would probably methylate the acetylide to form CH3-C≡C-Li, but wait, the acetylide is at the end. Oh, wait, perhaps the acetylide is at the end, so methylating that would give CH3-C≡C- attached to cyclohexane. So after alkylation, we'd have C6H11-C≡C-CH3. Wait, but that would be propargylcyclohexane, but perhaps more accurately, the alkyne is extended.

Wait, maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, after deprotonating the alkyne, perhaps we can do a hydration. But wait, another thought: if we hydrogenate the alkyne, we can get an alkene. But that's not directly helpful for forming an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. For that, oxidation of the alkyne would be needed. Ozonolysis of an alkyne gives diketones, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the alkyne is converted to an aldehyde. How? One method is to first reduce the alky
