Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I'm supposed to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is Aij. The elements Aij are given as hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Then, find the average value of that operator. The options are A to D.

Hmm, wait, the first part is about probabilities of measuring in certain eigenstates. But wait, the operator whose matrix is given by Aij is different from the spin-z operator. So I think I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates to find the probabilities.

Wait, let me think. The operator A is a 2x2 matrix because |up> and |down> are two states. So A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. So let me write that matrix out.

A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

Wait that's correct because Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0 and 0, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2 each. So A is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

But what are the eigenstates of this operator? Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenstate is the square of the amplitude of that eigenstate in the |alpha> state.

Wait, but wait. The |up> and |down> states are the eigenstates of S_z, but the operator A is a different operator. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and then compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can diagonalize operator A and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, express |alpha> in terms of these eigenvectors, and the coefficients will give us the probabilities.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenstates of A.

The matrix A is 2x2:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

To find the eigenvalues, solve det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar^2/4) = 0.

So λ^2 = (hbar^2)/4 => λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, no: lambda squared equals (hbar^2)/4. So lambda is plus or minus hbar/2. Wait, no, sqrt( (hbar/2)^2 ) is hbar/2, so λ = ± (hbar/2).

So the eigenvalues are + hbar/2 and - hbar/2.

Now, to find the eigenvectors.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) is:

[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  -hbar/2 ]

The equations are:

- hbar/2 * x + hbar/2 * y = 0 → -x + y = 0 → y = x.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T. Or, more precisely, any scalar multiple of (1,1).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + λ I) is:

[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

The equations become:

( hbar/2 ) x + (hbar/2) y = 0 → x + y = 0 → y = -x.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, -1]^T.

Wait, but these are just the |+> and |-> states for spin in the x-direction. Because the Pauli X matrix has eigenvectors (1,1) and (1,-1), corresponding to eigenvalues +1 and -1. So operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, I think.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], then A = (hbar/2) * X, where X is the Pauli matrix.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of X, which are the spin-up and spin-down in the x-direction, usually denoted as |+x> and |-x>.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm. The eigenstates for X are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2), but in our case, our basis is |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z. So |up> is (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) for spin-1/2? Wait, no, for spin-1/2, |up> is (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |down> is (|0> − |1>)/sqrt(2) when considering the X eigenbasis? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed without thinking about the physical meaning and just work with the vectors.

So, for A, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, yes, because when you have a matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal, the eigenvectors are those symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.

So now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>.

First, I need to normalize this state, I think. Because the question says it's proportional to that, so |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> multiplied by a normalization constant.

Let me compute the norm of the vector (1+i, 2−i).

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2−i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait, no, |a + ib|^2 is a^2 + b^2. So |1+i| is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

Similarly, |2−i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5). So |2−i|^2 is 5.

Thus, the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it correctly.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. The inner product is <alpha|alpha> = (1+i)^* (1+i) + (2−i)^* (2−i).

Wait, no, the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2−i)(2+i), because the coefficients are complex. So |1+i|^2 is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 =2. |2−i|^2 is (2−i)(2+i)=4 +1=5. So sum is 7, so normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>, all divided by sqrt(7).

Ok, now I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down> )

Similarly, |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> - |down> )

So, express |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x> .

Let me solve for c1 and c2.

We have:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2−i) |down> ] / sqrt(7) = c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

[ (1+i) |up> + (2−i) |down> ] / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) = c1 (|up> + |down> ) + c2 (|up> − |down> )

Simplify the left side:

(1+i) |up> + (2−i) |down> ) * sqrt(2/7) = [ (1+i) * sqrt(2/7) ] |up> + [ (2−i) * sqrt(2/7) ] |down> 

On the right side:

(c1 + c2) |up> + (c1 - c2) |down> 

So equate the coefficients:

(1+i) * sqrt(2/7) = c1 + c2   ...(1)

(2−i) * sqrt(2/7) = c1 - c2   ...(2)

Now, add equations (1) and (2):

(1+i + 2−i) * sqrt(2/7) = 2 c1 

So (3) * sqrt(2/7) = 2 c1 → c1 = (3) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 

Wait, let me compute that:

3 * sqrt(2/7) / 2 → 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Which is (3/sqrt(14)) ) * sqrt(2) → Wait, perhaps it's better to compute numerically, but maybe not. Alternatively, let's solve for c1 and c2.

Alternatively, subtract (2) from (1):

(1+i - (2−i)) * sqrt(2/7) = 2 c2 

Which is (1+i -2 + i) ) * sqrt(2/7) = ( (-1 + 2i) ) * sqrt(2/7) = 2 c2 → c2 = ( (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2/7) ) / 2 

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute c1 and c2 in terms of equations (1) and (2).

So, equations (1) and (2) are:

c1 + c2 = A 

c1 - c2 = B 

where A = (1+i) sqrt(2/7), B = (2−i) sqrt(2/7)

So adding: 2c1 = A + B → c1 = (A + B)/2 

Subtracting: 2c2 = A - B → c2 = (A - B)/2 

So let's compute A and B.

A = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)

B = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

So A + B = (1+i + 2 -i) ) * sqrt(2/7) = (3) * sqrt(2/7)

So c1 = 3 * sqrt(2/7) / 2

Similarly, A - B = (1+i -2 +i) ) * sqrt(2/7) = (-1 + 2i) ) * sqrt(2/7)

So c2 = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7) / 2 

Hmm, these expressions might be complex, but perhaps we can compute their magnitudes squared, which will give the probabilities.

Because the probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is |c1|^2, and |-x> is |c2|^2.

Wait, but wait. Because |alpha> is a normalized state, the sum of |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 must equal 1.

So let's compute |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

First, compute |A|^2:

A is (1+i) sqrt(2/7). So |A|^2 = |1+i|^2 * (2/7) = (2) * (2/7) = 4/7.

Similarly, |B|^2 = |2-i|^2 * (2/7) = (5) * (2/7) )= 10/7.

Wait, but wait: That's not correct. Because |(1+i) sqrt(2/7)|^2 is |1+i|^2 * (2/7) → (2) * (2/7) = 4/7.

Similarly, |B|^2 is |2−i|^2 * (2/7) = 5 * (2/7) = 10/7. Wait, but that can't be because 4/7 + 10/7 = 14/7 = 2, which is not possible because |alpha> is normalized.

Wait, but wait, A and B are the coefficients in the equation, but when I'm adding and subtracting them, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute |c1|^2 and |c2|^2 directly.

c1 is (A + B)/2 → (3 sqrt(2/7)) ) / 2. So |c1|^2 = (9 * (2/7)) ) / 4 = (18/7) /4 = 9/(14).

Similarly, c2 is (A - B)/2 → [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2/7) ] / 2.

Wait, but let me compute |c2|^2:

The numerator is (-1 + 2i), so |−1+2i|^2 is (1^2 + 2^2) = 5.

So |c2|^2 is (5 * (2/7)) ) / (4) → (10/7) /4 = 10/(28) = 5/14.

So |c1|^2 is 9/14, |c2|^2 is 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 +5/14 is 14/14=1. That makes sense.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches approximately with 9/14 (≈0.6429) and 5/14 (≈0.3571). So option A would have probabilities about 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but let's proceed to find the average value.

The average value of an operator is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since |alpha> is expressed as c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>, the expectation value is c1 * (hbar/2) + c2 * (-hbar/2), because |+x> has eigenvalue hbar/2 and |-x> has eigenvalue -hbar/2.

So <A> = (hbar/2)(|c1|^2 - |c2|^2 )

Wait, no, because expectation value is sum of |c_i|^2 * lambda_i.

Because |c1|^2 is the probability of measuring lambda_1, and |c2|^2 is the probability of lambda_2.

So <A> = |c1|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c2|^2 * (-hbar/2 )

= (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2 )

= [ (9/14) - (5/14) ] * hbar/2

= (4/14) * hbar/2 → (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= hbar/(7).

So <A> is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A has average value hbar/7, so this would fit. The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the option A would have probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of |c1| and |c2|.

Wait, I thought |c1|^2 is (3 sqrt(2/7)/2 ) squared → (9 * (2/7)) ) /4 → 18/(28) = 9/14.

Similarly, for c2, |c2|^2 is |(-1+2i) sqrt(2/7)/2 |^2 → |(-1+2i)|^2 is 1+4=5. So (5 * 2/7) /4 → 10/(28) = 5/14.

Yes, correct. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So option A has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

But then looking at the options, option A is:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7

So this would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps compute <A> directly, without going through the eigenstates.

Because |alpha> is given, perhaps we can compute <A> as <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a matrix, let's compute it.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So <alpha| is [ (1−i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1−i)/sqrt(7) , (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] × A × [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]

So A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So when we multiply A by |alpha>, we get:

A|alpha> = [ (0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)*(2−i)) / sqrt(7) ; ( (hbar/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2−i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute the matrix multiplication.

Actually, the product A |alpha> is:

A |alpha> = [ (0*(1+i) + (hbar/2)*(2−i) ) / sqrt(7) , ( (hbar/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2−i) ) / sqrt(7) ]^T

So the first component is (hbar/2)(2−i) / sqrt(7)
The second component is (hbar/2)(1+i) / sqrt(7)

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is:

(1−i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2−i)/sqrt(7) + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

Let me compute each term.

First term:

(1−i) (2−i) → (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i * 2) + (-i * (-i))
= 2 -i -2i + i^2
= 2 -3i + (-1) (since i^2=-1)
= 1 -3i.

Multiply by (hbar/2) / (7) → [ (1-3i) * hbar/2 ] /7.

Second term:

(2+i) (1+i) → 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
=2 + 2i +i +i^2
=2 +3i + (-1)
=1 +3i.

Multiply by (hbar/2) /7 → [ (1+3i) * hbar/2 ] /7.

So adding both terms:

[ (1−3i) + (1+3i) ) * hbar/(2 *7) ) ]

= [ 2 * hbar/(14) ) ] → 2 hbar/(14) = hbar/7.

So <A> is hbar/7. Which matches our earlier result.

So the average value is hbar/7.

So the correct option is A, which has probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7 → seems correct.

Other options: B's average is 3hbar/sqrt(7), which is bigger; D has 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is even bigger. So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

The denominator \(\sqrt{7}\) ensures normalization, as the norm of the state is computed as:

\[
\| (1+i, 2-i) \| = \sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2} = \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7}.
\]

The operator \(A\) is given by:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix represents a spin operator in the \(x\)-direction, scaled by \(\frac{\hbar}{2}\). The eigenstates of \(A\) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \(X\)-matrix, which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), we express \(|\alpha\rangle\) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting the expressions for \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), we write:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_1 |+x\rangle + c_2 |-x\rangle,
\]

where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are coefficients determined by solving:

\[
\frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}} = c_1 \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} + c_2 \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Matching coefficients, we find:

\[
c_1 = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

The probabilities are given by \(|c_1|^2\) and \(|c_2|^2\). Computing these:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left|\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left|\frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), corresponding to the eigenstates \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), respectively.

Next, the average value of \(A\) is computed using the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(A\), we compute:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
(1-i)(2-i) = 1 - 3i, \quad (2+i)(1+i) = 1 + 3i, \quad \text{so the sum is } 2.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{2}{7} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Probabilities: \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), Average value: \(\frac{\hbar}{7}\).**

Answer: A
