Okay, so I have this physics problem here about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, but specifically in a certain energy level. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy levels are the same for both stars because they're talking about the same specific transition. So the energy difference ΔE is given. Let's call E1 and E2 the two energy levels, with E2 being higher than E1. So E2 - E1 = ΔE.

The problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait. No, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. So maybe they're in a higher energy state more often? Or perhaps the excitation here refers to the population in a particular energy level.

Wait, no, I think it's the population ratio. So if the energy levels are E1 and E2, and E2 is higher, the number of atoms in E2 compared to E1 is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for each star, the ratio n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where T is the star's temperature.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: which way is it? For a given transition, say from E_lower to E_upper, the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. So if the energy level in consideration is the excited state (higher energy), then n_upper = n_lower * exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

Or the other way around? Let me think: higher energy levels have lower populations. So n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Right, so if ΔE is positive, the exponent is negative, so the ratio is less than 1. So in a hotter star, the ratio is closer to 1, meaning more excitation.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the number in the upper level is twice that of star_2. Or is it the ratio of excitation?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So probably, the number of excited atoms in a specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or alternatively, the excitation parameter is different.

Wait, but I think the way it's phrased, the excitation is about the population in a certain energy level. So let's think in terms of the ratio between the two stars for the same level.

Let me denote the ratio as (n_upper, star1) / (n_upper, star2) = 2. Or is it the ratio of (n_upper / n_lower) for each star?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the ratio of the excitation in each star. Let me define the ratio for each star as R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1 and R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2.

Given that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2, so R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps for a specific energy level, the number in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2.
