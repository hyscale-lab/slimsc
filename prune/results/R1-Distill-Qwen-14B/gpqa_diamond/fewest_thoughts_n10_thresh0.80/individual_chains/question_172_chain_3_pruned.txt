Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms. Let me try to break this down.

So, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's a very small number, like 1.38 times 10 to the minus 23rd power.

I remember that when atoms are in a star's photosphere, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation levels are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. That's the thing where the population of energy levels depends on temperature. The formula I recall is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

In this case, the energy difference is given as delta E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say for star 1, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is twice that of star 2. So, for star_1, the population ratio is higher than star_2. 

Wait, so for star_1, the ratio is n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). Because the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, meaning twice the population in that higher energy level compared to star_2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio for each star would be n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - deltaE/(k*T) )

Assuming the statistical weights g are the same for both stars (since it's the same element, same transition), then the ratio simplifies to exp( - deltaE/(k T) ). So for star_1, ratio is exp( - deltaE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's exp( - deltaE/(k T2) ).

Given that star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's, but wait, wait. Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So does that mean the ratio (n_i / n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. So for the same transition, more atoms in star_1 are in the excited state. Let's model this.

Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = (n_i1 / n_j1 ) = 2 * R2, where R2 is the ratio for star_2. Because star_1 is more excited, R1 is larger than R2. Because the excitation is higher, the ratio is
