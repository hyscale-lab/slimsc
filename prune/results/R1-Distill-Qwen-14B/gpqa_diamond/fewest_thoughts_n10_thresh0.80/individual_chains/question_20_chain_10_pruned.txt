Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is a common assumption where nucleons are treated like they're free, meaning they don't interact much with each other. So the question is asking which assumptions together lead to this scenario.

The options are four statements numbered 1 to 4, and the choices A to D combine three of them. I need to pick which combination is correct.

Let me go through each assumption one by one.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So this suggests that the force or interaction is only felt by each nucleon individually, not collectively. That makes sense for treating them as free because each acts independently.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Transparent—so like, when considering a particular interaction, the other nucleons don't affect the process much. So the nucleus doesn't significantly hinder the interaction beyond the specific nucleon involved. This would mean the other nucleons are treated as if they're not there, which is like treating the selected nucleon as free.

3. The quarks inside the nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, quarks being non-relativistic? That might affect how the nucleon behaves. If quarks are moving at speeds much less than light, their internal dynamics are simpler. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? I'm not sure yet. If the quarks are non-relativistic, the nucleon's structure is maybe treated more simply, but I'm not certain if that's part of the impulse approximation's assumptions.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. So, during the interaction, the nucleon isn't influenced by the binding forces holding it in the nucleus. This would mean it's moving freely, as if it's not part of a bound system. That definitely fits with the idea of treating them as free nucleons.

Now, the question is which three assumptions together imply the impulse approximation. Let's think about what each statement is saying.

The impulse approximation is often used in models where each nucleon behaves almost like a free particle, interacting via some external force. So, the nucleus as a whole isn't affecting the individual except in the way the interaction is applied.

Assumption 1 says the interaction only affects individual nucleons. So that makes the interactions local to each nucleon, not collective.

Assumption 2 implies that the nucleus doesn't impede the interaction beyond the selected nucleon—so other nucleons don't contribute to the interaction. So, the other nucleons are transparent, meaning the interaction isn't scattered or modified by them. So the selected nucleon's response is what's important.

Assumption 4 says the selected nucleon doesn't feel binding forces during the interaction. So, it's like the nucleon is free to move without the internal binding affecting its interaction.

What about assumption 3? Quarks being non-relativistic. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. The impulse approximation is more about the behavior of the nucleon as a whole rather than its internal structure. If the quarks are non-relativistic, it might simplify the treatment of the nucleon's internal motion. But is that a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation itself? Or is it a separate assumption about how the nucleon's structure is treated?

Wait, the question says which assumptions jointly imply the "impulse" approximation. The impulse approximation is a model where the nucleus is treated as a collection of weakly interacting nucleons. So, each nucleon's response is calculated as if it's free, and the others don't affect it much.

So, the key points are that each nucleon only interacts via the external interaction (statement 1), the other nucleons don't interfere (statement 2), and the nucleon isn't bound during the interaction (statement 4). So, that would be statements 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but what about statement 3? Do the quarks' properties affect the impulse approximation? I think the impulse approximation is more about the dynamics of the nucleons in the nucleus, not their internal structure. So maybe statement 3 is not directly part of the assumptions for the impulse approximation.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 1,2,4. That looks right.

Option C is 1,2,3. But
