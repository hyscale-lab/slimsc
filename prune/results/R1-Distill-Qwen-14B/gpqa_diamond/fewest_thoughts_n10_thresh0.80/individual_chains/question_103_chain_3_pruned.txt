Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll try to draw the target molecule in my mind. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which means the ketone group (ethan-1-one) is attached to a benzene ring that has two substituents: a bromo group and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5, respectively, relative to the ketone. So the benzene ring has the ketone at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents are on the phenyl group attached to the ketone. So the structure is a phenyl ring with a ketone group (C=O) attached to it as a substituent. Then, on that same ring, there are two other groups: bromine at position 3 and nitro group at position 5. So the numbering would be such that if the ketone is position 1, then the bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. So the positions are meta to each other, I think.

Now, the problem is figuring out the reaction sequence to get from benzene to this compound. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps using different reagents.

Let me think about the functional groups and their positions. Starting with benzene, I need to introduce substituents in the correct order so that the directing effects of each group lead to the next substituent being added in the right position.

I know that nitration is a meta-directing reaction when the ring has a nitro group. But wait, when you have a ketone group, which is a meta director. Wait, wait, no: the ketone group is an electron-withdrawing group and thus meta-directing. So when I add substituents, each new group will influence where the next group goes.

Wait, but the problem is that we have a ketone, bromine, and nitro groups. Let's think about the steps needed to add these groups in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to imagine the order in which substituents are introduced because the order will determine where each group ends up due to the directing effects of the existing substituents.

So, the target molecule has three groups: ketone (ethanone), bromo, and nitro. Let me think about the order in which these might be introduced.

Option A's steps: Let's see. Step i is CH3COCl/AlCl3, which is an acetylation (Friedel-Crafts acylation) to add the ketone group. Benzene under Friedel-Crafts acylation would form acetophenone. Then, step ii is Br2/FeBr3, which is bromination. Since the ketone is meta-directing, the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the ketone. So now we have a bromine on the ring, meta to the ketone.

Then step iii is HNO3/H2SO4, which is nitration. Nitration is also a meta-directing reaction. So the nitro group would go where? Wait, the ring now has two substituents: ketone (at position 1) and bromine (position 3). So for nitration, the existing substituents are the ketone (meta) and bromine (also meta). So where would the nitro group go?

Wait, when there are multiple substituents, the directing effect is determined by the strongest director. Nitro is a strong meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director. So the next nitration would be influenced by both.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added in the position that's meta to the ketone and para to the bromine, but that might require looking at their positions. Let's think: after adding bromine at position 3 (assuming ketone is at position 1), then the ring has groups at 1 and 3. Nitration would typically add in the position that's most activated. Wait, but both groups are meta directors, which deactivate the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that is meta to both. Wait, maybe that's not possible, so perhaps the nitration occurs at position 5 relative to the ketone. Because position 3 is already occupied by Br, the next meta position for the ketone would be position 5. So that would give nitration at position 5.

But wait, after step i (Friedel-Crafts), the ring has the ketone (say,
