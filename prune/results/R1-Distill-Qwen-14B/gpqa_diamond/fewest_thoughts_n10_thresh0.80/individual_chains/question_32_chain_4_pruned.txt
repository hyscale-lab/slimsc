Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so X here is a specific nucleus.

Wait, the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons and varying neutrons. Li-6 has 3 neutrons (since 6 = 3 protons + 3 neutrons), making it lithium-6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

I need to find the energy of the RHIC. I think the energy here refers to the kinetic energy each nucleus has when it's moving at 0.96c. Or wait, no, in particle physics, when they talk about energy in colliders, it's usually the total energy, not just kinetic. But maybe I should clarify that point.

So, the first thing I should probably do is find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy can be calculated using Einstein's equation E=mcÂ². But I need the mass of Li-6. I think the atomic mass of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol, but wait, that's for Li-7. Oh, right, because lithium has several isotopes. Li-6 is about 7.849 g/mol? Wait no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Let's think: The atomic mass of Li-7 is about 7.016 g/mol. So Li-6 would have an atomic mass of approximately 6.016 g/mol? Wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, using the standard formula for atomic mass based on protons and neutrons.

The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But exact numbers might be tricky without a table. Alternatively, I can recall that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c
