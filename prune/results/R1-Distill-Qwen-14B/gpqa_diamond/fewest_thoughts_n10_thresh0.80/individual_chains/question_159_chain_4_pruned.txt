Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines are common, but this peak might be something else. Oh wait! There's something about redshift and the Lyman-alpha forest, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is usually around 121 nm in the rest frame. If it's observed at 790 nm, that would mean a lot of redshift.

Wait, redshift z is calculated by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. Observed is 790 nm. So z = (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5, so 6.5 - 1 is 5.5. So redshift z is about 5.5.

But wait, wait. The question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1. Wait, scale factor a=1 is the present time, right? So the comoving distance is the distance now. But quasars are at high redshifts, so the comoving distance would be very large.

Wait, the question is about the current comoving distance. So what's the formula for comoving distance? Oh right, the comoving distance D_C is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H(a)) da, where a is the scale factor, and H(a) is the Hubble parameter at that time.

But wait, another way to think about it is using the formula D_C = (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [1 / E(a)] da, where E(a) = sqrt(Ω_r a^{-4} + Ω_m a^{-3} + Ω_k a^{-2} + Ω_Λ). Since the universe is flat, Ω_k is zero. So E(a) = sqrt(Ω_r a^{-4} + Ω_m a^{-3} + Ω_Λ).

But wait, in the standard Lambda
