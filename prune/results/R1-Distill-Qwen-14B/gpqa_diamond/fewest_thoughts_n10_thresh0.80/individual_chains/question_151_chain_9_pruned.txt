Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value of an observable. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three components, so it's a 3-dimensional state vector. That means it's in a three-level system, like spin-1 or something similar.

The observable is represented by matrix P. Let me look at the structure of P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Oh, wait, I think I should write that down more clearly. So P looks like:

[ 0        1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2      0      1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2      0     ]

Hmm, okay. Now, in quantum mechanics, the observable's eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if the observable is represented by matrix P, perhaps the eigenvalues are the possible results. But in the problem, they're asking specifically for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P that correspond to the eigenvalue 0, and then find the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.

Wait, but maybe I should first check what the eigenvalues of P are. Because sometimes the observable matrix might have 0 as an eigenvalue, and sometimes not. Let me try to find the eigenvalues of P.

To find the eigenvalues, I'll solve the characteristic equation: det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix P - λ I would be:

[ -λ       1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2     -λ       1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2    -λ     ]

Calculating the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ
