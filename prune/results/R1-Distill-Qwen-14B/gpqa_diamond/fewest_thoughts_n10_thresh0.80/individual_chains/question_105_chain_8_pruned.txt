Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to walk through it step by step. Alright, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed, similar to what we might see with an exoplanet. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as the spotted star. Hmm, I think I need to figure out how both the star's spots and the planet would affect the light curve.

First, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star is the same as R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor — I remember that's the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. So 20% coverage. Each spot is cooler than the surrounding: the Teff of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so their temperature is 5000K.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. This causes the observed brightness to dip periodically. The same would happen if a planet transited the star, blocking some light. But here, the spots are causing a similar effect, so we need to compare the dip in brightness from the spots to what a planet would cause.

The problem says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what would the planet's radius need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So we're looking for R_planet / R_star, which I'll call R_p.

I think the approach here is to calculate the fractional change in brightness, delta F, for both the spotted star and the planet transit. Then set them equal and solve for R_p.

Starting with the star's spots: The total brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and how much cooler they are. The star's total flux when spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

The star's total surface area is 4πR^2. The spots cover 20% of that, so the area of spots is 0.2 * 4πR^2. But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so maybe I should think about each hemisphere as 2πR^2. Oh wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, so the spots cover 0.2 * 2πR^2 = 0.4πR^2 on each hemisphere? Wait, no. Wait, the star has two hemispheres. The problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR^2 = 0.4πR^2. Because each hemisphere is 2πR², right? So one hemisphere, 20% coverage, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² is the area of spots. But wait, wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR², so one hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² of spots.

The star's total flux without spots would be F_total = σTeff^4 * 4πR², where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. When spots are present, the flux is F_unspotted + F_spots.

F_unspotted is the flux from the non-spotted part of the hemisphere and the other hemisphere. Wait, the other hemisphere isn't spotted. So wait, the star has two hemispheres: one with 20% spots, the other completely unspotted. So the unspotted part of the spotty hemisphere is 80% of that hemisphere, which is 0.8 * 2πR². So the unspotted area is 0.8 * 2πR² + 2πR² (the other hemisphere) = (0
