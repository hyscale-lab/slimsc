Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about brightness variations in a star that's similar to the Sun. The star has spots on one hemisphere, and we're supposed to find what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness change if it were transiting the star instead.

Wait, the setup says that one hemisphere has dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically. But without the spots, what planet size would cause the same dip?

I remember that the brightness variation when a planet transits a star is due to the blockage of light. The formula for the change in brightness (ΔF) is (Rp / R*)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and R* is the star's radius. But wait, that's when the planet blocks the star's light uniformly. But in this case, the spots are causing a brightness variation because the spots are cooler.

Wait, but the problem states that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet would produce the same signal? So we're comparing the two scenarios: star with spots and a planet transit, both causing a certain brightness change.

So first, I need to find the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the spots, and then equate that to the amplitude caused by the planet transit.

The star's radius is equal to the Sun's, R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (4π R^2 / 2) because one hemisphere is 2π R² and 20% of that is the spot area. Wait, maybe just think in terms of the area of spots relative to the star.

The star's total surface area is 4π R². But the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, so 20% of (2π R²) is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the spot area is 0.4 π R². Is that correct? Because 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * (2π R²) )= 0.
