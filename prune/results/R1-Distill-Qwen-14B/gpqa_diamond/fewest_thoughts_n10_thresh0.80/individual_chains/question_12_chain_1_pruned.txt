Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is initially at rest, and I'm given their rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny rest masses, almost zero. So in this case, the neutrino's rest mass can probably be neglected. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the calculations.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So after the decay, the total momentum of the products should also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. Hmm, so their magnitudes are the same, but their directions are opposite.

I remember that in particle decay problems, energy and momentum conservation are key. Let's think about the energy conservation. The rest energy of the pion should equal the sum of the rest energies of the muon and neutrino plus their kinetic energies.

But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is approximately equal to its kinetic energy plus its momentum multiplied by c squared. But since neutrinos are so light, their rest energy is almost zero, so their total energy is almost their kinetic energy plus pc. But I'm a bit confused about how to model this precisely.

Let me write down the equations. 

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino: E_mu + E_nu.

The energy of the muon is its rest energy plus kinetic energy: E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = (gamma m_mu c²) = m_mu c² + K_mu.

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = sqrt( (p_nu c)^2 + (m_nu c²)^2 ). But since m_nu is almost zero, E_nu ≈ p_nu c. And since neutrino's kinetic energy K_nu is approximately E_nu, because m_nu c² is negligible, then K_nu ≈ p_nu c.

But wait, the momentum of muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. So let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of each.

So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = m_mu c² + K_mu.

And for the neutrino, E_nu ≈ p c.

Now, let's set up the equations.

Energy conservation: E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.
