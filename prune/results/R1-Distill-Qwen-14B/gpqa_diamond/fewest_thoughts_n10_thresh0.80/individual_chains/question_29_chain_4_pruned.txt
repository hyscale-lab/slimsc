Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and find one where the compound is eliminated. 

So, they sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. The question is asking which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which mutation disrupts the gene's function. Since the compound is anti-nutritional, likely the gene product (probably a protein) is responsible, so disrupting the gene would stop the compound's synthesis.

First, I should look at each mutant's sequence and see where the changes are. The intact gene is given as a reference. Let me write down the sequences to compare.

Intact gene starts with:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, comparing to the intact gene:
The 4th and 5th nucleotides: Intact is TT (positions 4-5?), but mutant 1 has TT as well. Wait, let me count.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for where the changes are. Let me compare each part.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Looking at the first part, the intact has ATGTTT... So positions 1-6 are ATGTTT.

Mutant1 has ATGTTCT. Oh, wait, so the 6th nucleotide in the intact is T, but in mutant1, position 6 is C? Let me count:

Intact: positions 1-10: ATG TTT CTC
Mutant1: positions 1-10: ATG TCT TAC

Wait, so at the 3rd position, the intact has T, but mutant1 has T? Hmm. Wait, maybe I should print each sequence and line them up.

Let me write the first parts:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

So the first change is at the third codon. Intact: TTT (which is Phe), Mutant1: TCT (which is Ser). Then the next codon: Intact was CTC (Leu), Mutant1 has TAC (Tyr). Oh wait, so two changes in the first exons.

Wait, but the question says the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. So all the mutations are in the first exon.

But wait, the question says the changes are in the first exon area, so the exons are probably being looked at for possible early mutations.

But what's important is whether the mutations lead to a nonfunctional protein.

So for each mutant, let's see what the changes are and how they affect the amino acids.

The key is to see if the mutation causes a frameshift, a stop codon, or an
