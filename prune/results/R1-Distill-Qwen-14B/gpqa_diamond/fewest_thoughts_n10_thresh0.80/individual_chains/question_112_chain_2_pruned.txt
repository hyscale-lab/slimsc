Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me take it step by step. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator given a specific state and matrix. 

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's equal to some constant times that. Oh wait, maybe they just mean the state is exactly that, but normalized. Because when you have a state vector, it's usually given as a normalized state.

So, first, I need to normalize |alpha>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So, I'll calculate the inner product of the state with itself.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), because when you take the conjugate transpose, the coefficients become (1-i) and (2+i).

Wait wait, no. Let me think again. The state is a column vector, so |alpha> = [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T, right? Because |up> and |down> are the basis states. So the inner product would be (1+i)*(1-i) + (2 - i)*(2 + i).

Let me compute each term. The first term is (1+i)(1-i). Multiply that out: 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i) = 1 -i + i -i^2. i squared is -1, so this becomes 1 -i +i +1 = 2.

The second term is (2 -i)(2 + i). That's 2*2 + 2i -i*2 -i^2. Which is 4 + 2i -2i -(-1) = 4 + 0i +1 =5. 

So the total inner product is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Now, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, since we are dealing with up and down states (two basis states). So the matrix A would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because A_11 =0, A_12 = hbar/2, A_21= hbar/2, A_22=0.

This matrix is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Now, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of sigma_x. But wait, the problem says, "eigenstates of the operator whose matrix is Aij." So I need to
