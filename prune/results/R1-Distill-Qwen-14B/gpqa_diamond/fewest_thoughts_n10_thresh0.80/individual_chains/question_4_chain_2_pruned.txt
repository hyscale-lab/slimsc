Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, wait, in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. So that's different here. The question is asking which of Maxwell's equations would change in such a scenario. Let me think.

Maxwell's equations are four in total. I remember they are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

So in our universe, the divergence of B is zero, which means there are no isolated magnetic charges (monopoles). That's equation number two.

But in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So, if monopoles exist, that would affect the equations. Let me think about each equation.

The first equation, Gauss's law for E, relates to electric charges. Since the question is about magnetic monopoles, this one probably remains the same. So it's not equation 1 that's changing.

Equation two is ∇·B = 0. But if monopoles exist, B would have divergence proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how E's divergence relates to electric charge. So equation two would change. So that's one equation that's different.

Then equation three, Faraday's Law: it's about the curl of E. In our universe, it's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. I think if there are magnetic monopoles, this equation might change. Wait, but wait—Faraday’s Law is about changing magnetic fields inducing electric fields. How would monopoles affect that? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Maybe the presence of magnetic current or something else would change it. Alternatively, maybe not. I'll have to come back to this.

Equation four is Ampère's Law. In our case, it's about the curl of B being related to current and displacement current. If monopoles exist, maybe there's a new term related to magnetic current. So maybe equation four would also change. Or perhaps equation three.

Wait, let me think again. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, certain terms in Maxwell’s equations must get modified. I remember that in such a case, two equations change. The original equations without monopoles have ∇·B = 0 and ∇×E = 0 (without the time derivative term?), but wait, no, Faraday's law has the time derivative.

Wait, no—original Faraday’s law with no monopoles is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If monopoles exist, maybe a term appears in Faraday's law. Alternatively, maybe another equation changes.

Wait, let me think about the four equations.

In a universe with magnetic monopoles:

- The divergence of B would not be zero. It would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, ρ_m. So equation 2 changes: ∇·B = ρ_m / ε_m (I'm making up
