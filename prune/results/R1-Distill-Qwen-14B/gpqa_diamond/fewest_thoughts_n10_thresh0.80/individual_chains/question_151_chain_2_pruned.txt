Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about calculating the probability of measuring a particular observable and getting a specific outcome. Let me think through what I know.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, and the elements are complex numbers. Oh wait, but the elements here are real numbers, so that's fine. Also, for the state to be valid, it needs to be normalized. So I should check the normalization first.

The state vector is a column vector, let's denote it as |ψ⟩, which has components (-1, 2, 1). To normalize it, I need to compute the inner product of the vector with itself and see if it equals 1. The inner product is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is about 2.45. That means the state isn't normalized. So perhaps the actual state is this vector divided by sqrt(6), making it a unit vector. Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors must have a norm of 1. So the given state might be (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Wait, but the problem statement says the state is the column matrix with those elements. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that it's not normalized. Or maybe the problem expects us to normalize it first. Because if you don't, the probabilities might not add up correctly. So perhaps the first step is to normalize the state.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The inner product is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6): (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is already normalized, but in this case, it isn't. So maybe I should proceed with the given state as is, but that would complicate the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe I should normalize it, because otherwise, the probabilities might not make sense. Hmm
