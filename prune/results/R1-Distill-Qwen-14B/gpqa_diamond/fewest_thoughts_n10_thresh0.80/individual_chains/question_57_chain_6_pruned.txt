Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The given data is the phase shifts for different angular momenta. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, and the rest are ignored, so I guess we only consider up to l=4 here.

The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) can be expressed in terms of partial waves. The general formula involves a sum over all angular momenta l of the spherical harmonics multiplied by some coefficients involving the phase shifts.

Wait, right, the scattering amplitude f can be written as: 

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) * P_l(cosθ) ) ]

But wait, that's the general form. But here, the problem specifies that we're looking along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the incident beam direction is usually the direction of the initial momentum. So in scattering, that would correspond to θ=0°, because the incident particle is moving along, say, the z-axis, and we're looking at scattering into a
