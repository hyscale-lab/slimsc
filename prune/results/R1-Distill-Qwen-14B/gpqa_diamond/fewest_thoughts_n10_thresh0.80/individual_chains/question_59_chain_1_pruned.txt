Okay, so I've got to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out how much acid and base I have, and see if one is in excess.

So, let's break down each component:

1. **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** It's a weak acid. The concentration is 0.1 M, and the volume is 500 mL. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol.

2. **HCl (Strong Acid):** Concentration is 0.2 M, volume 400 mL. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.

3. **Ba(OH)2 (Strong Base):** Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. The concentration is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but when you mix them, the OH- from the base will react with the H+ from the acids. So the total H+ is from both CH3COOH and HCl.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. HCl is a strong acid, so it does. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. The acetic acid contributes some H+, but since it's weak, maybe we can treat it as a source of H+ that can be neutralized, but I'm not sure yet.

But wait, when mixing, first, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. So let's calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is strong, so it's 0.08 mol H+. Acetic acid is weak, so it's less. But in the initial step, maybe I should consider the neutralization.

Wait, but when mixing, the OH- will neutralize H+ from the strongest acids first, right? Wait, but in solution, the H+ comes from all sources. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the net H+ or OH- after all reactions.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

So, let's compute the equivalents:

- H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol. Since HCl is strong, it'll donate 0.08 mol H+.

- H+ from CH3COOH: As a weak acid, it's 0.05 mol, but since it's weak, not all will dissociate. But wait, in the presence of a strong base, maybe all will dissociate? Hmm, not necessarily. Alternatively, perhaps the initial H+ from CH3COOH can be considered as negligible because it's a weak acid, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total H+ from acids and the total OH- from the base, and see which is in excess.

So, total H+ available: HCl contributes 0.08 mol. CH3COOH contributes 0.05 mol (but as a weak acid, this might not fully dissociate, so perhaps only a fraction contributes H+). But when mixed with a base, maybe the OH- will react with H+ from both sources.

But perhaps for simplicity, when the base is added, the OH- will neutralize the H+ from the strong acid first, then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid.

Wait, but the strong acid (HCl) is a major source of H+, so the OH- will first neutralize that. Let's see:

Total OH-: 0.18 mol.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol. So after neutralizing, how much OH- is left?

OH- after neutralizing H+ from HCl: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH- left.

Now, this OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it's not a strong source. Let's see: the acetic acid contributes 0.05 mol of CH3COOH. The reaction with OH- would be:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH, producing acetate ions.

So, after the OH- reacts with as much CH3COOH as possible:

Available OH- is 0.10 mol. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. So the OH- will neutralize all 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, converting it into acetate ions.

After this, OH- left: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait. What about the H+ from the CH3COOH that wasn't neutralized? Because when CH3COOH is a weak acid, when some of it is neutralized to acetate, the solution may form a buffer. But I'm not sure if I'm considering that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- after all possible neutralization, and then see if there's more H+ or OH- in the solution, and calculate the pH accordingly.

So, the process would be:

1. Calculate the total moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so all 0.08 mol H+ are available. CH3COOH is a weak acid; but when in solution, it can release some H+, but when mixed with a base, perhaps some of it is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to:

- Calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids.

- Calculate the total moles of OH- from all bases.

Then, the net H+ (or OH-) is the difference.

So, total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: Well, that's 0.05 mol, but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. The dissociation of CH3COOH is given by Ka, which is 1.8 × 10^-5. But when mixed with a strong base, the OH- will react with the H+ from both the strong and weak acids.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is to consider the neutralization reactions:

The OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the strongest acid (HCl), then the remaining OH- will neutralize the weaker acid (CH3COOH).

So:

Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

So, neutralizing HCl: 0.08 mol H+ + 0.08 mol OH
