Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The problem states there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I remember that FTIR is useful for identifying functional groups. The broad peak around 3000 is likely due to O-H stretch, which is common in alcohols and carboxylic acids. Since the peak is very broad, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because alcohols have less broad O-H stretches, which can sometimes be split into two if there are hydrogen bonds. Also, the strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 probably corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). In carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, which fits here.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The problem says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. So, the structure doesn't have any allylic or conjugated double bonds. All the hydrogens are probably in more saturated environments.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a mouthful. Let me think. A quartet (4 peaks) suggests coupling with three neighboring protons. Then, a triplet (3 peaks) on top of that would mean coupling with two neighboring sets. And a doublet (2 peaks) would come from coupling with one set. So this signal is split into a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, wait, no, the structure is usually described as (multiplicity) of (splitting). So a doublet of triplet of quartet would be first split into a quartet, then each of those peaks splits into triplets, and then each of those into doublets. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. No, wait, the splitting is stepwise. So first, the quartet comes from coupling with a group of three hydrogens. Then, each of those lines splits into triplets due to coupling with a group of two hydrogens. Then each of those lines splits again into doublets from another coupling with one hydrogen. That's a complex splitting pattern. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way aroundâ€”starting from the first splitting. I'm a bit confused, but perhaps each step adds more splitting.

Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, similar logic. First, a triplet, then each of those splits into triplets again, and then each splits into doublets. Or maybe the first is a triplet, then another triplet, then another doublet. I'm not entirely sure, but maybe the splitting indicates the number of neighboring protons and their coupling constants.

Now, looking at the options provided:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, the structure is something like:
- The central part is a C(H)(C2H5) on both sides. So each of those carbons is connected to another CH group with ethyl groups. Then there's a CH2 before the COOH group.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Here, the central part is two CH groups with ethyl substituents, and the COOH is at the end.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Each central carbon has a methyl group attached, and then a CH2COOH at the end.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
The central part is two CH groups with methyl substituents, and the COOH is at the end.

Wait, but all the options have a COOH group, right? So they're all carboxylic acids, which aligns with the IR data of the O-H and C=O.

Now, considering the NMR signals. The absence of vinyl hydrogens suggests no double bonds, which aligns with all options because they don't have any.

Looking at the substituents around the carbonyl group. Let's imagine the structure. Each option is a substituted butanoic acid or similar. Let's try to imagine the structure around the carbonyl.

In all options, the COOH is either at the end (like in A, B, D) or with a CH2 in front (like C). Wait, looking again:

Option D: the structure is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)...COOH. So, the chain is -(CH2)2-...COOH. The central carbons are CH with methyl groups attached.

Option A: The COOH is after a CH2. So the structure is ...CH2COOH.

Now, in the NMR, the complex splitting patterns (doublet of triplets etc.) must come from neighboring protons. Let's think about which structures would lead to such splitting.

For example, in option D: the structure is like CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

So, the central two carbons each have a CH group with a methyl group attached. Each CH group is adjacent to another CH, which is adjacent to an ethyl group (from CH3CH2-). Wait, no. Let's break it down:

The structure from D is: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the part
