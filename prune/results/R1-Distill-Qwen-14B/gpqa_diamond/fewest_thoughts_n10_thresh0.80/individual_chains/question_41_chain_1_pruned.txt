Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see.

So the setup is: a glass with index of refraction n is moving at a constant velocity v. The direction of the glass's movement is the same as the light beam's direction and towards the observer. The observer is in the laboratory frame. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. The light is inside the glass, right? Because the glass is the medium here. Oh, but the glass is moving. So I need to find the speed of the light beam as observed from the lab frame.

Wait a second, I remember that in a medium, the speed of light depends on the refractive index. Normally, when the medium is stationary, the speed is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the light's speed?

I'm a bit fuzzy on how velocities add in different frames. Oh right, there's the Galilean transformation, but wait, that's only approximately correct at low speeds. Since the glass is moving at velocity v, which I assume is much less than c, maybe Galilean is okay here. But wait, light speed is always c in a vacuum, regardless of the source's motion. But this is a medium, so things might be different.

Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But if the medium is moving
