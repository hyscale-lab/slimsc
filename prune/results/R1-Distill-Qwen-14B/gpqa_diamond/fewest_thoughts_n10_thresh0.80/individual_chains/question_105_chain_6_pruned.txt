Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about starspots and exoplanets. Hmm, let's see. The question is about how the brightness variations caused by a star with spots can mimic an exoplanet's transit, and we need to find the radius ratio of a planet that would produce the same brightness change.

Alright, let's break it down. The star has the same radius as the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the filling factor is 0.2. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.

The problem says that when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing periodic brightness changes. This looks like a planet transiting the star. We need to find what planet radius would give the same light curve amplitude if it were a planet instead of spots.

Wait, so when a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness is the area blocked times the difference in brightness per unit area. For the star with spots, the change is due to the spots' temperature difference when they come into view.

But how do I calculate the change in brightness for both cases?

For the exoplanet transit: The drop in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is (pi R_p^2)/(pi R_s^2) = (R_p/R_s)^2. But that's assuming the planet blocks the same temperature area, which is correct because the entire star is at Teff. So the dip is (Rp/Rs)^2.

Wait, but for the star with spots, it's a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, they contribute less light. The total brightness is the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas.

The star's flux when spots are on the near side would be F = F_unspotted * (1 - filling factor) + F_spotted * filling factor.

Wait, no. Let's think about it. The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π Rstar² * σ Teff^4 / (4π D^2) ) when observed from Earth, but perhaps we can ignore the distance for this calculation. Alternatively, the flux without spots is F0. When spots are present, the flux is F0 * (1 - filling factor) + F_spots * filling factor.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model the star as a perfect blackbody. The total flux without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4. The area of the star is 4π Rstar². But when spots are present, the total flux becomes F_total = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

Where f is the filling factor, 0.2 here. F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spot, which is σ (Teff - ΔT)^4. Wait, wait, the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K. So F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So F_total = (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4, multiplied by σ. But when we calculate the brightness variation due to rotation, only the part of the spots that comes into view changes. Wait, no—because the whole spot area is on the hemisphere, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view as a whole or not.

Wait, wait, the star is observed from Earth, and one hemisphere is spotted. So as the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. So when the spot is facing us, the total flux is lower, and when it's not, flux is higher.

So the change in flux is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not. Wait, no. The star is rotating, so when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower, and when it's the other side (unspotted), the flux is higher.

Wait, but the photometric observations are done from a distance, so the observed flux depends on how much of the spotted area is visible. Let's model it as the star having a filling factor f of spots on one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the fraction of spots that are visible varies. But when the spotted side is facing us, all the spots are visible, so the flux is F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

Wait, but wait, the filling factor is 0.2, so f=0.2. So when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f) + f * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) * F0.

Because F0 is σ Teff^4, so F_spot is σ T_spot^4 = (5000/6000)^4 F0.

So F_total when spots are visible is F0 [ (1 - f) + f (5000/6000)^4 ].

The change in flux compared to when the spots are not visible (i.e., when the unspotted side is facing us) would be the difference between maximum and minimum flux. Or perhaps the change is the dip when the spots come into view.

Wait, no. The maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. The change in brightness is F_max - F_min, but wait, no, it's the dip: F_max - F_current when spots are visible.

Wait, let me think again. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspotted = F0.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = (1 - f
