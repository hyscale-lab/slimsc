Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes periodically, which can look like an exoplanet causing a dip in brightness when it transits the star.

The question is asking: if the star wasn't covered in spots, what exoplanet radius relative to the star's radius would cause the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do?

Hmm, I remember that the brightness variation (the signal in the light curve) depends on the area blocked and the temperature difference. So when a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is a function of the planet's area compared to the star's area. But in this case, the spots also affect the brightness because they're cooler.

Wait, the star's spots are dark, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. But how much does that dimming compare to a planet blocking part of the star?

Let me break it down. The star has a radius R (same as Sun, R_sun). The spots are on one hemisphere, covering 20% (filling factor) of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere, so maybe I should think in terms of the entire star's surface. The total surface area of the star is 4πR². So the area covered by spots is 20% of a hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface. Wait, that's different from the filling factor. Oh wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So each hemisphere (front and back) would have 20% coverage. Wait, no, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So the total area covered is 20% of one hemisphere.

So the area blocked by spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction is 0.4 π / 4 π = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

But that's not the only factor. The spots are cooler, so the flux from the spots is less. The flux from the star without spots is based on its effective temperature, Teff. The flux from the spots is lower because their temperature is Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

Wait, the flux from a star's surface is proportional to T^4. So the flux from the spotted area is lower. So the total flux when the spots are facing us is the normal flux minus the flux from the spots plus the flux from the cooler spots.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4π R² * sigma * T^4. When there are spots covering some area, the luminosity becomes L = (4π R² - A) * sigma * T^4 + A * sigma * (T_spot)^4. Where A is the area of the spots.

So the change in luminosity (delta L) is A * sigma (T^4 - T_spot^4). But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux, so the star appears dimmer. The variation in brightness will depend on how much the spots contribute to the total flux.

But in the case of the exoplanet, the planet blocks part of the star's light. So the dip in brightness is (A_planet / A_star) * (Teff^4) / (Teff^4) )? Wait, no. Because when the planet blocks part of the star, the blocked area is at the star's temperature, so the dip is (area blocked) * (flux per unit area) at T. So the relative change is (A_planet / A_star) * (sigma T^4) / (sigma T^4) ) = (A_p / A_s) = (R_p^2 / R_s^2).
