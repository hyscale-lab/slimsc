Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a charged conductor with a cavity. Hmm. Let me read the question again carefully.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside, whose center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity.

The question is asking for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from point P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions involving these variables. So, I need to figure out which one correctly represents the electric field at point P.

Alright, let's think about what I know regarding conductors and electric fields. So, when a conductor is neutral and there's a charge inside a cavity, how does that affect the field outside?

I remember that in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. But if there's a cavity, the charges might redistribute. Wait, right! When a conductor encloses a charge, the charges in the conductor will arrange themselves in such a way to cancel the electric field inside the conductor but not necessarily inside the cavity.

Wait, so for a conductor with a cavity that's uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh, right! The inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the one inside the cavity, and the outer surface will have a charge that's the same as the inner charge to maintain the conductor's neutrality. Wait, no, the conductor starts uncharged, so let me clarify.

No, wait. The conductor is initially uncharged. So, when we place a +q charge in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced -q charge. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a +q charge. Because the total charge on the conductor was zero, so inner surface -q, so outer surface +q to balance.

Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor? The field outside a conducting shell with a charge Q is
