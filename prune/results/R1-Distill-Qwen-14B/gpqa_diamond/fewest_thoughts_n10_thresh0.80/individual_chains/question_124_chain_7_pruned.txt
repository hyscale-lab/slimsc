Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. But the question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls? The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is probably the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the speed of the particles, and the time they take to reach the detector wall. Since the particles decay quickly, only those that reach the wall before decaying will be detected. So if they're moving faster, they'll take less time, which might mean a higher chance of reaching the wall before decaying. But wait, the problem is about the fraction reaching the wall, so maybe it's related to the speed and how that affects the time available for decay.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The problem says that at a Lorentz factor of ~20, one third reach the wall. We need to find the Lorentz factor when two-thirds reach. So the fraction depends on the speed. How?

I remember that the proper lifetime of a particle is the lifetime measured in its rest frame. When it's moving at relativistic speeds, the lifetime as seen in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is longer due to time dilation. The Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So a higher gamma means the particle lives longer in the lab frame.

So if a particle lives longer, it can travel a longer distance before decaying. So for a given detector size, particles with a higher gamma (faster) will have a higher probability of reaching the wall because they live longer in our time frame.

Wait, but wait again. No, I think I might have it backward. Because, the proper lifetime is shorter. Wait, no: in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. Because gamma is the factor by which time is dilated. So for gamma=20, the particle's lifetime is 20
