Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the ejecta and the Galaxy are both in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, right? Because in special relativity, the relative speed is symmetrical. Oh wait, no, wait. No, no, wait a second. Oh, wait, no, that's not quite right. Because from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta would be moving towards at the same speed? Actually, yes, because in classical mechanics, speeds just add. But wait, maybe relativistic effects are important here because 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, let's calculate the speed in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times c. So 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light. That's pretty fast, so relativistic effects might matter, like time dilation and length contraction. But the question is about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So from the ejecta's perspective, 50 seconds go by, and during that time, how much distance does the ejecta cover in the Galaxy's frame? But wait, no, the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So the time experienced in the ejecta is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but if the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy, the time experienced in each frame is different due to time dilation. So perhaps I need to calculate the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame and then multiply by the speed to find the distance.

So, let's think step by step.

First, the speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s. Let me denote this as v = 6e4 km/s.

But wait, to work with relativity, it's better to use units where c is 1, but perhaps I can approach it using the standard equations.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards at the same speed v. So the time experienced in each frame for a given event would differ due to time dilation.

Wait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta’s frame, the time is t’ =50 s. We need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy’s frame, t. Once we have t, the distance the ejecta travels is v * t.

But how to relate t and t’?

Using the time dilation formula from special relativity: t’ = gamma (t - (v x)/c²). But in this case, in the ejecta's frame, the event (the passage of time) is at the same location. So x’ is zero. So the formula simplifies to t’ = gamma (t - 0 ), so t = t’ / gamma.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the Lorentz transformation correct. The time dilation formula is t’ = gamma (t - v x / c²). But if x=0 in the galaxy's frame (assuming the event is at the same spot in the galaxy's frame), then t’ = gamma t. So t = t’ / gamma.

But wait, perhaps I should consider the proper time. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. Wait, but in this scenario, the event is the passage of time, which is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the relationship between the two frames.

So, the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is t’=50 s. We need to find the corresponding t in the Galaxy's frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the ejecta.

Wait, no. Wait, the ejecta is moving at speed v relative to the Galaxy. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is different from the ejecta's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the time in the Galaxy's frame is shorter because the ejecta is moving, so their clocks are ticking slower. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, time dilation says that a moving clock runs slower. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is running slow. So if the ejecta experiences 50 seconds, the Galaxy would measure less time passing.

Wait, but the question is the reverse. The Galaxy wants to know how much the ejecta has moved in t (Galaxy's time) which is less than the ejecta's 50 seconds.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the problem.

We have two frames: S (Galaxy) and S’ (ejecta). The speed of the ejecta in S is v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. So in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v.

In the S’ frame (ejecta), the Galaxy is approaching at velocity v.

The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. But in this case, the process is just the passage of time, which is the same in all frames, but the measurement of time differs due to the relative motion.

Wait, but the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the time interval) happen at the same place. So when we have an object moving, the proper time is the time measured in the object's rest frame.

In this case, the 50 seconds are measured in the ejecta's frame (S’), which is the proper frame for the ejecta. So the proper time is t’=50 s.

We need to find the time elapsed in S (Galaxy's frame), which is t.

The time dilation formula is t’ = gamma (t - (v x)/c²). But if the event (start and end of the time interval) happen at the same point in S’ frame, then x’=0. So the equation simplifies.

But wait, in S frame, the event (say, the start and end of the time interval) are happening at different positions because the ejecta is moving. So the x in S isn't zero.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that in the ejecta's frame, they are stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards them at v. But from the Galaxy’s frame, the ejecta is moving towards them at v, and the time measured in the Galaxy is t, while in the ejecta it's t’=50 s.

The time dilation formula is t’ = gamma (t - v x / c² )

But in the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end of time) are at the same place, so x’ =0. So the equation becomes t’= gamma t.

So t = t’ / gamma.

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let me compute gamma first.

v =60,000 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. So v/c = 0.2.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204. Hmm, let me calculate it more accurately.

Compute 0.96^0.5: sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma ≈ 1.0206.

So t = t’ / gamma = 50 / 1.0206 ≈ 49.0 seconds.

Wait, but wait. No, no, wait a second. Because in the ejecta’s frame, the time is longer, right? Because from the Galaxy’s frame, the ejecta is moving, so the ejecta's clock is running slow.

Wait, maybe I got the formula inverted. Let me think again. The time measured in the moving frame (ejecta) is longer than the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) because the moving clock runs slow.

Alternatively, using the formula, when the frame S' (ejecta) is moving at velocity v relative to S (Galaxy), the time in S is less than the time in S'.

So, for example, if the ejecta’s clock shows 50 seconds, the Galaxy would measure less than 50 seconds.

So, in the formula, t’ = gamma (t - (v x)/c²), but in this case, the events are in the same place in S’ frame, so x’=0. So t’= gamma * t.

Thus, t = t’ / gamma.

So with t’=50, gamma≈1.0206, t≈50 / 1.0206 ≈49.0 seconds.

Wait, that's approximately 49 seconds. But let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 1 / sqrt(0.96) is exactly 1 / sqrt(24/25) ) = 5/ (2 * sqrt(6)) )? Wait, sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(96/100)=sqrt(24/25)=sqrt(24)/5.

Wait, sqrt(24) is about 4.89898, so sqrt(24)/5 ≈ 0.9798. So 1 / 0.9798 ≈1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So t=50 / 1.0206 ≈49.0 seconds.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should not round so quickly.

Let me compute 50 / 1.0206.

1.0206 * 49 = 50?

Well, 1.0206 * 49 = (1 *49) + (0.0206 *49) = 49 + approx 1.0094 = 50.0094. So 49 seconds would give t’=50.0094 s, which is a bit over 50. So to have t’=50, t must be a little less than 49.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would help, but I don't have one. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to just proceed with the exact gamma.

Wait, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)) ) = 1/(sqrt(0.96)) = approximately 1.0206.

So t ≈50 / 1.0206 ≈49.0 seconds.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is about 49 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta has traveled in the Galaxy's frame is v * t.

v is 60,000 km/s. t is 49 seconds.

So 60,000 *49 = 2,940,000 km.

Looking at the options, option A is 2,940,000 km. Option B is 3,000,000, which would be if v*t was (60,000 *50), but that's without considering the time dilation effect. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the formula right? Because sometimes in special relativity, the calculation for distance can involve length contraction as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the distance in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction.

Wait, no, because the problem asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame, so perhaps I should compute it directly.

Another approach: in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s for time t. So the distance is v*t.

But to find t, we use the time experienced in the ejecta's frame. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is less than the ejecta’s time.

Wait, perhaps I should use the velocity composition formula, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the Lorentz transformation for velocity. But no, that's probably complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a simple speed multiplied by time, but without considering relativity. Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, so relativistic effects might be significant.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore relativity and do a straightforward calculation. Let me read the problem again. It says, "Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored." But it doesn't say anything about relativity, so maybe they just want a classical approach.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think: if we ignore relativity, then the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, so distance is 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But wait, the question states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So in classical mechanics, the time in each frame would be the same. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds would also pass in the Galaxy's frame. Thus, the distance would be v * t =60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But wait, that's conflicting with the relativity approach. So which is it?

The problem says both are inertial frames. So in Galilean relativity, the time is the same in each frame, so the distance is v * t =60,000 *50=3e6 km.

But special relativity says time is different. So which approach is correct?

Wait, the question specifically says to ignore gravity and rotation, but it doesn't mention relativity. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the classical method, so the answer would be B) 3,000,000 km.

Hmm, but the initial statement says they are inertial frames, which is a concept from relativity. So perhaps the problem expects the relativity approach.

Wait, but the problem gives the speed as 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, so a significant fraction. But if the intended answer uses classical physics, that would be option B. However, if we use relativity, the answer is option A.

But wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed is 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the proper time is actually in the ejecta's frame. So for events happening in the ejecta, the proper time is t’=50 s. The time in the Galaxy's frame (S) is t = t’ / gamma.

So, perhaps the distance the ejecta travels is v * t, which is 60,000 * (50 / gamma).

Since gamma is 1.0206, so 50/gamma is about 49.0. So 60,000 *49= 2,940,000 km, which is option A.

But why would the problem mention that both are inertial frames? Because in Newtonian mechanics, inertial frames don't affect each other's time, so it's irrelevant. So perhaps the problem expects the special relativity approach.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, if the speed is a significant fraction of c, you have to consider relativity, but if it's not specified, maybe it's expected to ignore it.

Wait, but 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a notable fraction, so perhaps the problem expects the relativistic consideration.

So, the correct approach would be to compute the time in the Galaxy's frame as t = t’ / gamma, then multiply by v to get the distance.

Thus, the distance is v * t =60,000 * (50/1.0206) ≈60,000 *49.0≈2,940,000 km. So the answer is option A.

But wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation.

v =6e4 km/s.

c=3e5 km/s.

v/c = 0.2.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) =1/sqrt(0.96)= approx 1.02060467.

So t=50 /1.02060467 ≈49.0 seconds.

So distance=6e4 *49=2,940,000 km.

Which is option A.

But wait, another point: when the ejecta's frame is moving towards the Galaxy, perhaps it's better to think about the motion in terms of the proper length. Wait, proper length is the length measured in the rest frame of the object. So in the Galaxy's frame, the distance to the center is longer than in the ejecta's frame? Hmm, I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply a Doppler shift question, but I don't think so.

No, I think the correct approach is to use time dilation, so the answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when \( 50 \, \text{s} \) pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativity of Time**: Since the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, time dilation must be considered. The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) is related to the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   t' = \gamma t \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \), we calculate:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206.
   \]
   Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   t = \frac{t'}{\gamma} = \frac{50}{1.0206} \approx 49.0 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled**: In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at a constant speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) for the time \( t \approx 49.0 \, \text{s} \). The distance traveled is:
   \[
   d = v \cdot t = 60,000 \cdot 49.0 \approx 2,940,000 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A (\( 2,940,000 \, \text{km} \))**: Matches the calculated distance when time dilation is considered.
   - **Option B (\( 3,000,000 \, \text{km} \))**: This would be the distance if time dilation were ignored, but it is incorrect due to relativistic effects.
   - **Option C (\( 2,880,000 \, \text{km} \))**: Incorrect, as it does not align with the relativistic calculation.
   - **Option D (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \))**: Incorrect, as it overestimates the distance.

### Conclusion:
The correct distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is \( 2,940,000 \, \text{km} \), corresponding to **Option A**.
