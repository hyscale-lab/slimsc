Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Let me think through this step by step.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l, with l and L both being greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, so I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding comes into play. Wait, but wait, that's for charges inside a conductor. Oh right, in a conductor, the charges redistribute such that the interior (the cavity) is shielded from external electric fields. But wait, in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. But then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. How does that affect things?

Wait, I think the cavity is inside the conductor. So, when you place a charge inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to that, and the outer surface will have the same charge as the original because the conductor was neutral. Wait, no. No, wait. Let me think again. The conductor was initially uncharged. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q because the charge +q induces charges on the inner walls. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor. So the charges in a conductor will redistribute. So, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor was zero, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so at a distance L from the conductor's center. But wait, the conductor is a sphere of radius R
