Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so each has two possibilities. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total. I can list them all, calculate E for each, then sum exp(-beta E).

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe it's best to list all possible states and compute their energies.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Since the spins are symmetric, perhaps I can group them by the number of aligned pairs or something like that.

Let me think: Each term in E is S_i S_j. If S_i and S_j are the same (both +1 or both -1), then S_i S_j is +1. If they're opposite, it's -1.

So each pair contributes either +1 or -1 to the sum in E. So the total inside the brackets is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Hmm, let's calculate for each state what this sum is.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the sum.

Wait, the sum can vary. Let's see.

Wait, for three spins, the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 are:

Let me think. Let me consider all possible cases.

Case 1: All spins are the same. So all S_i = +1 or all -1.

If all are +1: Each product S_i S_j = 1. So sum is 1 +1 +1 =3.

Similarly, if all are -1: Each product is (-1)(-1)=1. So sum is 3.

So in these cases, E = -J * 3.

So the energy is -3J.

Case 2: Two spins are +1, one is -1.

Let me think about the possible configurations. For example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Compute the sum:

S1S2 = (+1)(+1) = 1.

S1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

So E = -J * (-1) = +J.

Similarly, any case where two are +1, one -1 will have sum -1.

Wait, how many such states are there? Let's see: choosing which spin is -1. There are 3 choices. So 3 states with energy +J.

Wait no,
