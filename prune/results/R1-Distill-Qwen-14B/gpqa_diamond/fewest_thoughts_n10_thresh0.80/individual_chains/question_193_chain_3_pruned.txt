Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars varies with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance—closer stars have larger parallaxes, right?

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I should probably relate parallax to distance first.

I think the formula connecting parallax (plx) and distance (r) is plx = 1 / r, but wait, wait. Oh right, parallax is measured in parsecs, and the formula is r (in parsecs) = 1 / plx (in arcseconds). So plx is inversely proportional to r: plx ∝ 1/r. That makes sense because a closer star has a larger parallax.

So if plx = 1/r, then plx^5 would be (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. So 1/plx^5 would be r^5. Because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So putting it all together, N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait—the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance.

Wait, no, the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write this down:

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx = 1/r, then plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm, perhaps it's about the number density or the number per unit volume? Or maybe it's just the total number in a shell of radius r and thickness dr.

Wait, if the number of stars varies as r^5, that suggests that the number increases rapidly with distance. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if stars are spread out, moving further away would give fewer stars in a given volume.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: "the number of stars
