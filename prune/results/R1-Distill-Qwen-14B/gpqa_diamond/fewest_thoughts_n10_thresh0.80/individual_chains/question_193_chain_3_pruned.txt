Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1 divided by parallax^5, or N ∝ 1/plx^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So distance d is 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I think I need to express N in terms of d, and then find the derivative or something to see the rate of change per unit distance.

Let me write down what I know. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d. So substituting that in, N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Oh wait, so the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance? But wait, that can't be right. Because as you look further away, you'd expect fewer stars in a given area, but maybe the question is considering a specific region, so perhaps it's considering a volume or something.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about this again. If N is proportional to d^5, that would mean that as distance increases, the number of stars increases, which seems counterintuitive. That's not right because in reality, stars are more concentrated in the galactic plane and such. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in substituting.

Wait, let's double-check. Let's define plx as the parallax, which is in arcseconds. And distance d in parsecs is given by d = 1/plx. So if plx is small (which means d is large), then 1/(plx)^5 becomes d^5. So N is proportional to d^5, which would mean that as distance increases, the number of stars increases. That seems odd because more distant regions would have more
