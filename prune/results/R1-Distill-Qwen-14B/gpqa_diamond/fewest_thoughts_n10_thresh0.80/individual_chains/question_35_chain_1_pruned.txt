Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix given with the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to the Pauli matrices for spin-1/2 particles. Since a muon is a spin-1/2 particle, this makes sense. The Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of these matrices is 2x2 and they have specific forms.

Wait, the matrix S given here looks familiar. Let me think. The σ_y matrix is usually:
[0  -i]
[i   0]
Yes, that's exactly the S matrix given in the problem. So S is σ_y.

So the operator A_y is given by c times σ_y. And c is h/(4π). So the matrix for A_y would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by [0 -i; i 0].

Now, the question asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues and see which of the options is correct.

Wait, eigenvalues of a matrix come from the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So let's write A_y as a matrix. A_y = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

So the matrix A_y is:

[0       (h/(4π))*(-i)]
[(h/(4π))*i      0]

Alternatively, I can factor out (h/(4π)) and write it as (h/(4π)) multiplied by the σ_y matrix.

But for finding eigenvalues, perhaps it's easier to think about the eigenvalues of σ_y first, then scale by c.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are known. For Pauli matrices, each has eigenvalues ±1. Because for example, the trace is 0, determinant is -1, so eigenvalues are
