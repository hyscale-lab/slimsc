Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I should probably write that down.

Wait, what's S look like? Let me see. So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Oh wait, that's familiar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! The Pauli Y matrix is exactly like that. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So S here is σy, the Y Pauli matrix. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

And Ay is c times S. So the operator Ay is c * σy. Since c is h/(4π), Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to solve Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

Wait, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, finding eigenvalues involves solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So first, let's write out Ay. Since S is σy, which is the matrix given. So Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by that matrix. So each element of S is multiplied by c=h/(4π).

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

So the matrix Ay becomes:
[ 0                (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)        0           ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, compute the trace and determinant. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, which here is 0 + 0 = 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - [ (-i h)/(4π) * (i h)/(4π) ].

Let me compute the determinant:
= 0 - [ (-i * i) * (h^2)/( (4π)^2 ) ]
Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So it's (1) * (h^2)/(16 π²).

So determinant is 0 - [ (1) * h²/(16 π²) ) ] = - h²/(16 π²).

The characteristic equation is a^2 - (trace)a + determinant = 0. Since the trace is 0, it simplifies to a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²)
