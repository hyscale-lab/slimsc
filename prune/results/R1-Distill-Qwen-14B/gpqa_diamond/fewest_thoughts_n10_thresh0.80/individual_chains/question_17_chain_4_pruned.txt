Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. And the options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how strong the complex is. A larger Kf means the complex is more stable.

So the complex is Ca-EDTA. Let me think about the reaction. I think the formation of the complex would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

Wait, or is it Ca²+ + H2EDTA^2−? Oh, wait, no, because EDTA typically has different forms based on pH. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so I guess the form is the one that's most likely to form the complex. Maybe it's the deprotonated form. But I'm not sure if that's important right now.

The problem mentions a stoichiometric solution, which probably means that the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1. So the complex is 0.02 M, which is the concentration of the CaEDTA^2− complex.

Now, the formation constant Kf is given as 5e10, which is pretty high. So the complex is very stable. That means that most of the EDTA and Ca²+ would be in the complex form rather than free.

But wait, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in solution. So we have to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Because even a very stable complex can dissociate a little, especially when the Kf is huge. 

So, the dissociation reaction would be:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is for the formation of the complex, so the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

The expression for Kd would be [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-].

Wait, but in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and initially, before considering any dissociation, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be zero. But since the complex can dissociate a little, we can model it with an equilibrium.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. Then, at equilibrium, the concentrations would be:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x

But since Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to
