Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

The problem says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the concentration given is 0.02 M. So the solution is a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions. Because when EDTA complexes with Ca²+, it reduces the free ion concentration. So the free [Ca²+] should be much lower than 0.02 M.

I think the formation constant, K, relates the concentration of the complex to the product of the concentrations of the individual ions. For a complex like Ca-EDTA, the formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Wait, but wait. No, actually, the formation constant is usually written as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So when you have K, it's [Complex]/( [M][L] ), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand.

In this case, the complex is formed by Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the K is 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, then [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But what about the concentration of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4-?

Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, which I think means that the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, no, because the complex is 1:1 as well. So
