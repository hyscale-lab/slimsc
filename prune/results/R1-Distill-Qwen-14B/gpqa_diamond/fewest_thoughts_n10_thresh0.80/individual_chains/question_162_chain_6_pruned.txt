Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and from that, you can find things like area or volume.

The given metric is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. Oh right, I think this is a 2-dimensional metric because it only has dx and dy terms, so maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space?

Wait, pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given might be representing such a space. I remember that in 2D, the metric can be written in terms of coordinates, and the area can be calculated using integration.

The area element in a 2D metric is usually the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. Wait, more accurately, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor g_{ij}.

So first, I need to find the metric tensor components. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So that means g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_{yy} = same as g_{xx} because it's symmetric. The off-diagonal terms g_{xy} and g_{yx} are zero because there are no cross terms.

So the metric tensor in
