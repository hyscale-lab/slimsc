Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. So this ρ must be a density matrix for a qubit.

I think the first step is to write out what this matrix looks like. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ correspond to the computational basis vectors. So |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 at (1,1). Adding them together, each of these diagonal terms would be 1. But then we multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. That makes it [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, but how does this relate to the geometrical position in qubit space? I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in 3D space, where the components are (x, y, z). The vector is determined by the expectation values in the Pauli basis.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz). So let's expand this. The identity matrix I is 2x2 with 1s on the diagonal. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So if I write ρ as (I + r·σ)/2, then each component
