Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A through D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The reaction forms a complex, and the K here is the formation constant, right? The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is very stable.

The problem says it's a stochiometric solution, so I think that means the molar ratio between Ca²+ and EDTA is 1:1. So the complex is CaEDTA^2- perhaps? Or something similar.

Wait, the complex is stochiometric, so the concentration is 0.02 M. That would mean [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M. But we need the [Ca²+] in the solution. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA, I think the formula would involve the formation constant.

The formation constant K is given by the equation K = [CaEDTA²-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M.

But wait, in solution, the EDTA is in the form of HnY, but since the pH is ideal, we can assume that all the EDTA is in the form of Y^4-. So the total EDTA concentration is [Y^4-] plus the [CaEDTA²-], but wait no, because the complex is 0.02 M. Oh, wait, in stochiometric solution, the molar amounts are 1:1. So if the complex is 0.02 M, that means the amount of Ca²+ that's complexed is 0.02 M. But the free Ca²+ is something else, which we need to find.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions. So the total calcium comes from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, no. The complex is formed in solution. So the total calcium is the free Ca²+ plus the Ca bound in the complex. But wait, wait a second. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the rest is the free ions.

But wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, then for every mole of complex, we have one mole of calcium and one mole of EDTA. So the total EDTA is [EDTA] + [CaEDTA²-
