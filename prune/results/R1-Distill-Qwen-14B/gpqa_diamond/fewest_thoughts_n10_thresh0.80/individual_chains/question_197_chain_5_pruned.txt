Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying a final product after a reaction. The compound X has some IR and NMR data provided, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is based on the spectral data. Then, I'll determine what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

Let's look at the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But there’s also a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, possibly from a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might suggest conjugated double bonds, like in aromatic rings, or possibly carbonyl groups.

Now the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): This is a strong indicator of an acidic proton, maybe an aldehyde proton (but those are usually around 9-10 ppm), or maybe a phenol O-H. Wait, phenol O-H is usually broader and around 5 ppm. Hmm, but if it's de-shielded, maybe it's an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. So that's a possibility. 

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted ring. Two doublets with 2H each, likely para-substituted benzene. The upfield shift (7.2 ppm) could be for substituents with electron-withdrawing groups, but wait, if the substituents are electron-donating, like methyl, the ring protons might be downfield. But let's see. Wait, if the substituents are at the para position, then the protons on the ring would be ortho and meta. Wait, no, in a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents, the protons would be in two sets of doublets.

Wait, but in this case, the two doublets add up to four protons—so perhaps a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each in the para positions. Wait, no, maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene but in a way that produces two sets of doublets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a disubstituted benzene, like 4-substituted, with another group, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps. Or maybe a CH group in some kind of branch.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe another methylene group, perhaps adjacent to a CH or a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet or a doublet? Wait, it's a doublet of 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to a chiral center or perhaps a carbonyl. Like a COCH(CH2CH3)2 or something.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain. Like CH2CH3.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, and a side chain attached. The 10.5 ppm proton suggests a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is likely a substitution reaction, maybe a Fittig reaction or something else.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI is a common reagent for the Barbier reaction, but more commonly, I think red phosphorus is involved in the substitution of certain groups. Alternatively, HI can act as a nucleophile. But another possibility is that red phosphorus is used to deoxygenate certain functional groups.

Wait, another thought: when an alkyne reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a hydration reaction to form an alkene. But in this case, the starting material doesn't seem to be an alkyne based on the spectral data.

Alternatively, if compound X has a carbonyl group, say a ketone, and it reacts with HI, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But red phosphorus might be part of a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's what it is. But then what would happen when you treat it with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is from a carboxylic acid, which makes sense because the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl (like a carboxylic acid, which actually has a higher wavenumber than esters or ketones, but sometimes it's around 1700 cm-1). Alternatively, if the carbonyl is from an ester, the peak might be at 1720. But wait, the 10.5 ppm is more likely a carboxylic acid O-H, so maybe the IR at 1720 is the carbonyl.

So, let's hypothesize that compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. The NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would be the carboxylic acid proton. Then, the benzene ring has substituents. The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest a para-substituted ring. 

Wait, let's think: if it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent, like a side chain. The substituents would be in the para positions. Let's say, for example, the benzene has a carboxylic acid group in the para position and another group, maybe an ethyl or isobutyl chain.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests a CH group adjacent to something, perhaps a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two adjacent CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the structure might be something like 4-(something)benzoic acid. The side chain could be an isobutyl group. Let's see: the 2.9 ppm could be a CH connected to a carbonyl. Suppose the structure is:

Ph–CO–CH(CH2CH2CH3)– ?

Wait, but let me think about the substituents. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH group, perhaps. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is a CH2CH3 group. So maybe the chain is:

CO–CH(CH2CH2CH3)

Wait, but that would make the CH group have two substituents: a methyl and an ethyl. Wait, let me draw it out in my mind.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group attached to the benzene. But let me think about the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm is a methylene adjacent to a CH. Wait, no, it's a multiplet integrating for 1H, so maybe a CH group connected to two other groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-(propyl group)benzoic acid. But how would that fit the NMR?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think about that.

Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2–. Wait, no, the structure of isobutyl is (CH2)2CH–, but that's a tertiary butyl group. Let me correct this: the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no: isobutyl is (CH2)2CH–? No, the correct structure is CH2CH2 is ethyl, but isobutyl is CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but that's not correct. Let me think: the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait: the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2–? No, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but regardless, let me think about the structure based on the NMR.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain. So, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–CO–CH(CH2CH2CH3)– ?

Wait, but then the CH would have two substituents: a methyl and an ethyl. Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating for 1H, which would be the CH
