Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about identifying a product formed from a reaction involving Compound X. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, I remember that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction, typically an addition. So probably an acid-catalyzed addition where the H adds to one side and the iodide to the other.

But first, I need to figure out what Compound X is from its IR and NMR data. Let's break down the spectral data.

Starting with the IR: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely due to O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, looking at the options, they don't seem to have nitrogen, so maybe it's an O-H, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be C=C stretching, indicating an aromatic ring. So, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Now the NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – That's a broad singlet, possibly an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids typically have protons around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. Aldehydes are around 9-10, but can be deshielded. Since the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – These are typical aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So the four aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each with 2H. The integration is 2H each, so probably substituents at the para positions.

Looking at the downfield shift, the 8.0 ppm protons are more deshielded, so they're probably closer to the electronegative group. So if it's a para-substituted benzene, one substituent is at position 1, another at position 4? Wait, actually, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. So if the ring has two substituents, but wait, the aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests two sets of equivalent protons. So maybe a single substituent in the para position, but that doesn't account for four H. Wait, no, if it's a mono-substituted benzene, the protons are ortho, meta, para. But in this case, it's two doublets each with two H. Oh, wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, where the substituents are in the para positions. Like, for example,
