Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and how certain quantum numbers interact. Hmm, I'll need to think carefully. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question involves two nucleons (like protons or neutrons) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. I remember that parity is a quantum number that relates to spatial inversion. Since X has parity -1, that might affect the overall parity conservation.

Pauli statistics says that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. So the combined state of the two nucleons and the emitted particle X must obey certain symmetry rules. Oh wait, the problem states that T(NN), the isospin of the two nucleons, must equal S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Wait, what's isospin? Isospin is a kind of internal angular momentum, like spin, but for particles that are similar in mass, like protons and neutrons. For two nucleons, I think the isospin can be T=0 or T=1. The problem says T(NN) is 0 in the final state.

So for the final state, T=0. According to the given equation, T = S + L +1 mod 2. So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2. Which means S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity. One is even, the other odd.

Now, the initial state is a 1S0 state. Let me parse that term symbol. The notation is (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0 means S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L=0 (S is for spin, and L is orbital angular momentum). So the initial state has S_initial =0, L_initial=0.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, their state after emission must have certain quantum numbers. Let's denote the final state as having S', L', and J'. But wait, the question is about the partial waves, which are denoted by the angular momentum state of X. Each option specifies what X is.

Wait, the options are of the form 1S0 → something. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is the emitted particle plus the NN system. For example, option A says 7D1 + p. So X is a proton (p), and the final state of NN is 7D1. Wait, but the initial state is 1S0, so the NN state changes.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. The initial state is the NN system in 1S0. They emit X. So after emission, the NN system must be in some state, and X is emitted with some quantum numbers.

Wait, actually, I think I need to consider the angular momentum and spin of the emitted particle X. Also, the parity before and after must be considered because parity is conserved in strong interactions, but this might not be a strong interaction problem. Hmm, but the problem does mention the conservation of both angular momentum and parity, so I'll need to consider both.

So, the initial state is 1S0, so S_initial =0, L_initial=0, so J_initial=0. The parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (-1)^0 = 1.

When they emit X, the final state is the NN system plus X. The parity of the final state should be the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X.

Wait, the parity of the NN system (after emission) is P_NN', and the parity of X is given as -1. So the total parity would be P_NN' * (-1). But parity is conserved if the forces involved are conservative (like EM or strong). Assuming that, the initial parity equals the final parity.

So initial parity P_initial =1.

Final parity P_final = P_NN' * P_X = P_NN' * (-1).

So 1 = P_NN' * (-1) → P_NN' = -1.

But
