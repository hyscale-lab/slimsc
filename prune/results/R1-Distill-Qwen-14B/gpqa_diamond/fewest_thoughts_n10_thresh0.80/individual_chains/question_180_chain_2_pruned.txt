Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, so each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. So the charge for each particle would be 3.2e-19 C.

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, okay.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system. Oh right, that's potential energy. So I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of this setup.

In electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble the charges from infinity to their final positions. And since the system is isolated, we don't have to worry about external fields, I guess.

But wait, the system consists of 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are each located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P?

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each of these 12 is 2 meters away from P. So the setup is that the 13th is at P, and each of the other 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from it.

Wait, but how are the 12 charges arranged? Are they all on the same point? No, that can't be. Because if all 12 were at the same point, that would create a lot of repulsion. But perhaps in this problem, their exact arrangement doesn't matter because they are identical and fixed at points 2m from P.

Wait, but the potential energy in a system of charges depends on how they're arranged. Let me think about that. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 q2) / r.

But for a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies
