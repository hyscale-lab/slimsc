Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the energy of a system of point charges is the electrostatic potential energy. Since all the particles are the same, maybe I can calculate the potential each contributes and sum them up.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics for point charges is given by Coulomb's law for each pair of charges. The formula for the potential energy U between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, when calculating the total potential energy for a system of multiple charges, each pair contributes. So for n charges, each charge interacts with every other charge once. So the total potential energy would be (1/2) * n * (each pair's energy), because each pair is counted twice otherwise.

Wait, but in this problem, 12 charges are at 2 m from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at P, and the others are all at 2 m away from it. Oh, but wait: each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed—so it doesn't move. So the potential energy would come from the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, plus the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of the 12 is at the same point in space, right? Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. But their positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at
