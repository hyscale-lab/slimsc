Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So a proton and antiproton annihilate into two A+ and two A- particles. Hmm. The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. I'm not sure, but maybe that tells us about the initial conditions.

The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. Wait, that's the rest mass energy of A, right? So each A particle has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c².

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So after the annihilation, each A+ and A- is moving at what speed?

I think I need to use conservation of energy and momentum here. Because in any closed system, both energy and momentum are conserved. So let's think about this.

First, let's consider the initial setup. The proton and antiproton are colliding. The antiproton is moving slowly, so let's maybe consider that the proton is at rest. Wait, but wait, in reality, in particle physics, when a proton and antiproton collide, they are usually moving towards each other with some velocity. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe its speed is much lower than the speed of light, so relativistic effects on its energy might be negligible. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy, so we can approximate its energy as just m_p c², where m_p is the proton mass.

Wait, but the mass of the proton and antiproton. Oh, right, the proton and antiproton have the same mass. So m_p = m_p̄.

But let me get back. The initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let's assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some velocity. Or wait, maybe both are moving, but given that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps their velocities are such that their combined momentum is zero? No, wait, if they're moving towards each other, but one is moving slow, the other might have to be moving fast. Hmm, but the problem
