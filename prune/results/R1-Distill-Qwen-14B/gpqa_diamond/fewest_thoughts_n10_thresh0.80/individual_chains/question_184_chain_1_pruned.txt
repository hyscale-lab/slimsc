Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options (A to D) with different sequences of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence will give the desired product with high yield.

First, let me try to break down the target molecule. The substituents on the benzene ring are: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering in benzene rings can be a bit tricky. Let me visualize the structure. Numbering starts such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, that's a meta arrangement for some of them.

Wait, no. Let me sketch it out mentally. The ethoxy is at position 1 (assuming that's the primary position), then the tert-butyl is at position 2, and the nitro is at position 3. So in a benzene ring, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are such that nitro is meta to ethoxy and para to the tert-butyl? Hmm, maybe I should think about the substitution pattern.

Wait, the compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2. So positions 1,2,3 are adjacent in a row. So that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. But wait, in a benzene ring, numbering would be such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. So if the substituents are at 1,2,3, that's a meta arrangement for some, but maybe it's not possible for all three to be adjacent. Wait, no, benzene can have substituents in adjacent positions. So 1,2,3 would be a meta arrangement between 1 and 3, but 1 and 2 are adjacent.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. The key is to determine the order of reactions to get these substituents in place.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). The substituents are in positions 1,2,3 respectively. Wait, wait, the name is 2-t-bu, 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the substituents are on adjacent carbons in a row.

Now, when introducing substituents onto benzene, the order and directing effects of the groups are crucial. Directing effects determine where the next substituent will enter.

Benzene is initially activated (electron-rich) and undergoes electrophilic substitution. When groups are added, their directing effects influence where the next substitution occurs.

Let's think about the substituents:

- Ethoxy (OCH2CH3): This is an activating group (electron-donating via lone pairs on oxygen), so it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions relative to the ethoxy group.

- tert-Butyl: This is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group, which is activating). It's a strong activating group, and it's an ortho/para director.

- Nitro group (NO2): This is a deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group, so it's a meta director. It deactivates the ring, making further electrophilic substitution harder.

Wait, but adding a nitro group after adding other substituents would be difficult because the ring becomes deactivated. So perhaps the nitro group should be added early when the ring is more reactive.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So if the first substituent is nitro, the next substitution would be at the meta position relative to nitro. But we need a tert-butyl and an ethoxy in specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after some other substituents. Let's see.

Let me think about the possible steps.

One approach is to perform the substitution reactions in an order that allows each new group to go into the correct position given the directing effects of the existing groups.

The target has three substituents in positions 1,2,3. Let me imagine the ring as positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Wait, no, the name is 2-t-butyl, 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So when building this, perhaps the order of addition should be such that each new substituent goes into the correct position based on the existing groups.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about each substituent's effect:

1. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para director.

2. t-butyl is activating, ortho/para director.

3. Nitro is deactivating, meta director.

Hmm. It's tricky because after adding the nitro group, further substitution becomes harder.

So perhaps the nitro
