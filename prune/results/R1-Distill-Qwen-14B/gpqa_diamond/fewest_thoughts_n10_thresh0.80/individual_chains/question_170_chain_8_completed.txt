Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the state vector and the corresponding operator. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors. So (3i, 4) would be a column vector with the first component 3i and the second 4. Let me write that down:

The state vector ψ is:
ψ = [ 3i
       4 ]

But wait, should I normalize this vector? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the magnitudes is 1. Let me check. The first component has magnitude |3i| = 3, and the second is |4| =4. So squared magnitudes are 9 and 16, sum to 25. So the norm is sqrt(25)=5. So to normalize, I need to divide each component by 5. But wait, the expectation value uses the unnormalized vector? Or do I have to normalize it first because expectation values are calculated using the actual state, which must be normalized. Wait, but the formula for expectation value is <A> = <ψ| A |ψ>, where ψ is normalized. Oh wait, but if the state isn't normalized, then the expectation value would actually be the expectation of A in the state multiplied by the normalization factor. Hmm, maybe I should normalize it first. Because otherwise, the state isn't a valid quantum state because it doesn't have unit length.

So let me compute the normalization factor. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state is ψ_normalized = [3i/5, 4/5]^T. But wait, the question is about the expectation value of S_y. I'm not sure if the given state is already normalized or not. The problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps I should proceed without normalizing, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the expectation value is given by <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ. Because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So perhaps I can compute the expectation of σ_y and then multiply by ħ/2.

So the σ_y matrix is given as:

σ_y = [ 0  -i ]
       [ i   0 ]

Right. So the expectation value for σ_y is ψ† σ_y ψ.

Let me compute that. ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† is [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i, but wait, wait, the conjugate transpose. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, the state is (3i, 4), so ψ = [3i; 4], ψ† is [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector. Because the conjugate of 3i is -3i. Okay.

So now compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

Compute σ_y ψ first. Let me do that:

σ_y * ψ = [0  -i; i 0 ] * [3i; 4] 

First component: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = (-i)(4) = -4i.
Second component: i*3i + 0*4 = i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† σ_y ψ is the inner product of ψ† with (σ_y ψ), which is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So the inner product is (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.
(4)*(-3) = -12.

Adding them: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but that can't be right because the expectation value is given in terms of ħ/2, so perhaps I should have considered the normalization. Wait, but I didn't normalize ψ. Because the state given isn't normalized. Let me see: The original ψ has a magnitude squared of 25, so |ψ|^2 =25. So the normalized state is ψ_normalized = ψ / 5.

So perhaps the expectation value should be calculated as <σ_y> = (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) )

Wait, because if the state isn't normalized, the expectation value is <A> = (ψ† A ψ) / (ψ† ψ), since otherwise the state vector isn't a unit vector. Wait, no, the expectation value is computed as <A> = (ψ† A ψ) / (ψ† ψ) only if ψ is not normalized. Because the standard formula is <A> = (⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ ) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ), when |ψ⟩ is not normalized.

So in this case, ψ is not normalized, its inner product is 25.

So let me recalculate.

Compute ψ† σ_y ψ: as before, I got -24.

Then, ψ† ψ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 +16=25.

Thus, <σ_y> = (-24) / 25.

But wait, no, because the expectation value is <S_y> = <σ_y> * (ħ/2).

So S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * <σ_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) )= (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25, which matches.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation for any mistakes.

Compute σ_y ψ again: 

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

ψ is [3i; 4]

First element: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second element: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ]

Then ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]

So inner product is (-3i)*(-4i) +4*(-3) = (12 i²) + (-12) = (12*(-1)) + (-12) = -12 -12 = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

Then ψ† ψ =25.

So <σ_y> = (-24)/25.

Then <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25 → which is option A.

So the answer should be option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the given spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Formula
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle,
\]
where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)
The state vector is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), and its conjugate transpose is \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

First, compute \( \sigma_y \psi \):
\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \):
\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The first term is \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = -12 \), and the second term is \( 4(-3) = -12 \). Adding these gives:
\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = -12 - 12 = -24.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \)
The inner product \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) is:
\[
\psi^\dagger \psi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle \sigma_y \rangle \)
Using the formula for \( \langle \sigma_y \rangle \):
\[
\langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{-24}{25}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
