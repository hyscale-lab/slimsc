Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such wells, the particles have quantized energy levels. The question asks for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies of the system. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me start by recalling what I know. Each particle is a spin-1/2, which means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each energy level can hold a limited number of particles because of the spin states. Wait, in a 1D box, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And that's given as E in the problem. So E is (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), meaning each E_n is n² times E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, etc.

But since the particles are fermions (spin-1/2), they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can be occupied by at most two particles (because each spin state, up and down, can hold one particle each). So each energy level can have two particles maximum.

Wait, but in a 1D box, the quantum numbers are just n, the principal quantum number. The spin state is separate. So each energy level E_n can accommodate two particles (with spin up and down).

Now, the system has four particles. So I need to figure out how to distribute these four particles into the available energy levels, following the Pauli exclusion.

Ground state is the lowest possible energy. So we start filling from the lowest n.

n=1: can hold two particles (spin up and down). So two particles here.

n=2: next, can also hold two particles. So two more particles here.

Wait, but n=2 is higher energy than n=1, so adding two particles to n=2 would give a total of four. So that would mean the ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E. So two of E is 2E, two of 4E is 8E. Total is 10E. Wait, but wait, the question is about the energies of the system's states. So the ground state would have all four particles filled in the lowest possible energy levels, which would be n=1 and n=2 completely filled (each with two particles).

So the total energy E_ground = 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E?

Wait, but wait, the options don't have the ground state as 10E. Looking at the options, option B's ground state is 4E, but that seems off. Let's think again.

Wait, no, the question says, the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So I'm being asked for the energy of the entire
