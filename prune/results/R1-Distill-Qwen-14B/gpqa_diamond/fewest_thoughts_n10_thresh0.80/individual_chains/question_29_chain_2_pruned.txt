Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequence the target gene. Some mutations are found in the first exon area. The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by selecting the right mutation.

The question gives four mutants and their DNA sequences. I need to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the problematic compound. So, the key here is understanding how mutations in the gene could affect the resulting protein and thus the compound.

First, let's think about what causes anti-nutritional compounds. These are substances that interfere with the absorption of nutrients, maybe by inhibiting enzymes or binding to essential nutrients. If the gene produces a compound that's causing this, a mutation in the gene might disrupt the production of the compound.

Looking at the sequences, the wild-type (intact) gene is provided. Each mutant has a change somewhere in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here could change the amino acid sequence of the protein, possibly disrupting its function.

But wait, not all mutations are disruptive. Some might be silent (no change in amino acid), or they might cause a missense mutation (one amino acid changed), or a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon). Also, some mutations might disrupt the reading frame, causing a frameshift, which could lead to a completely different protein from that point onward.

The question is looking for a mutation that would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the gene product probably codes for something that either produces the compound or is involved in its synthesis. If we can disrupt the gene's function, the compound might not be made, solving the problem.

Let's look at each mutant's sequence:

Wild-type sequence:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild-type, let's see where the changes are. Let's look at each triplet (codon) to see if any changes occur.

Wild-type starts with ATG (which is Methionine, the start codon). Then TTT, which is Phe. The next codon is CTC, which is Leu. Then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), etc.

Looking at Mutant 1: The first part is ATG, then TTT becomes TTA, which is still Leu? Wait, wait. Let me align the sequences properly.

Wait, the given sequences are longer. Let me line them up:

Wild-type exon 1 sequence snippet: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps I should compare each nucleotide position.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to look for where the changes are in each mutant compared to wild-type.

Let me break it down:

Wild-type: positions 1-20 (as an example) might be ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, wait. Let me look for differences.

Wild-type: After ATG, the next codons are TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

Mutant 1: Let's look. The first part is ATG, then TTT, then CTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), GCT (Ala), etc. Wait, wait, perhaps I should look for the exact point where the change occurs.

Wait, the wild-type is: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant 1 is: ...CTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, in the wild-type, the sequence is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So positions 4-6: CTC; 7-9: GCT; 10-12: GGT; etc.

Mutant 1’s sequence after ATG is TTT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So, the CTC becomes CTA, and
