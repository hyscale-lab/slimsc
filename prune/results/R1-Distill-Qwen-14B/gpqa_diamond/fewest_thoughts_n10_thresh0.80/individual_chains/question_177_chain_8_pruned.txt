Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, that's interesting because usually the wavelength where a star emits most brightly (the peak wavelength) relates to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law says that λ_max * T = constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Hmm, okay, so T1 = T2.

But wait, no, wait a second. The question says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, that's the same as their peak emission wavelengths. So they must have the same temperature because Wien's displacement law says λ_max = b / T where b is Wien's constant. So if λ_max is the same for both, T1 = T2.

But wait, wait, wait. The question says the stars radiate as black bodies. So, their luminosity would depend on their radius, temperature, and other factors. The formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² T
