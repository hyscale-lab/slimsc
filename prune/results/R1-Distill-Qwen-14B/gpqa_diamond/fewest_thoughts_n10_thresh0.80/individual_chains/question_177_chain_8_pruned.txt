Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, the problem is about luminosity, so I'm not sure how mass comes into play here. Hmm, maybe the mass isn't directly relevant? Because luminosity is more about radius and temperature, right?

The astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest and found they're the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because the constant b is the same for both. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity based on black body radiation, so the formula for luminosity as a black body would be L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh, right, so L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem gives radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm. Radial velocity... I'm not sure how that factors into luminosity. Oh wait, maybe it's about Doppler shift? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would change due to the Doppler effect. Oh, but in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the stars' actual temperatures are different, but due to Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are same. So we have to correct for that?

Wait, let me think. Let's parse the problem again. The wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Are these the wavelengths they emit, or the wavelengths we observe? I think it's the wavelengths as observed from Earth because that's
