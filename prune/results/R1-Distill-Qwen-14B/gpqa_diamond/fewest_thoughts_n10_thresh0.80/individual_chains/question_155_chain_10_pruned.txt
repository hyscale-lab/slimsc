Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. The uncertainty is ΔP_z, right? I remember the formula for uncertainty is the square root of the expectation value of (P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z). So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but first, the state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is expressed in the P_z basis. Because the operators P_x, P_y, P_z have their matrices in this basis.

So, to find the uncertainty in P_z, I need to compute the expectation value ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩, then plug into the uncertainty formula.

But wait, since P_z is diagonal in the given basis, maybe this is easier. Because if the operator is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.

Let me look at the matrix for P_z. It's given as:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think correspond to the standard basis vectors in this case since the matrix is diagonal. So, the first basis vector is |1⟩, the second |0⟩, and the third |-1⟩, perhaps.

The state ψ is given as the vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that in components:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]   |1⟩
          [ 1/√2 ]   |0⟩
          [ -1/2 ]   |-1⟩

Wait, but wait, the state vector is a column vector, so it's
