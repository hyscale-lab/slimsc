Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the scenario is that someone synthesized a small peptidic compound, and they're looking at its NMR and LC-MS. There are some anomalies in the NMR, and the LC-MS also shows two peaks.

From the NMR part: The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integration suggests there's only one proton, but two signals. But the coupling isn't causing this because they ruled out spin-spin coupling. Wait, if it's the same alpha-proton, maybe it's about something else, like maybe the proton is split into two due to some other reason.

Then the LC-MS part: It shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, meaning same molecular weight. So the two peaks in the LC-MS are different entities but have the same mass. Same retention time? No, because the peaks are at elevated temperatures, maybe the same mass but different structures, like isomers.

So the options are:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. But the LC-MS shows same mass as expected, so it's not a lower mass precursor. Unless it's a co-eluting something else. Not sure yet.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, and they usually have the same mass spec because same molecular weight. In LC-MS, if the column is chiral, they would separate into two peaks. But if the column isn't chiral, they might elute together. But the question says the LC-MS at elevated temp shows two peaks. Hmm, maybe the temperature affects the column's ability to separate enantiomers. Wait, some columns are chiral, others aren't. If the column isn't chiral, enantiomers won't separate, so you'd see one peak. So if there are two peaks, maybe it's diastereomers since they can be separated on a regular column. So B might not be the case.

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Not sure what that means exactly. Maybe like when forming an amide, there's an intermediate that could lead to some coupling, perhaps causing more signals. But the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Maybe like an AB system or something else. Or perhaps if there's some coupling with different partners, but that might cause splitting into more lines, not two separate peaks. Wait, but if it's a case where during the reaction, the amide bond formed in two different ways leading to different coupling, but I'm not certain.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC-MS. Same molecular weight, so same mass spec. And in NMR, diastereomers can cause different splitting. Wait, but if the molecule is a diastereomer, each would have its own set of protons. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Wait, but each diastereomer would have its own alpha-proton environment. So,
