Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Alright, the given data: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, wait. Stability constants are for the complexes, right? So each β represents the formation constant for the nth complex.

I remember that the formation of complexes follows a stepwise process. So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+, the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on up to the fourth complex. Each β is the equilibrium constant for adding one SCN- to the previous complex.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the second complex. But wait, wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue ones. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. Or wait, maybe the blue one is a different complex? Wait, I think the dithiocyanate complexes can be different colors. Oh wait, the problem says the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So we need to find the fraction of cobalt in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ among all species.

To do this, I think we can use the stability constants to find the distribution of each complex. The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex (from 0 to 4 SCN- ligands) and then sum the fractions of each, but wait, the problem mentions dithiocyanato, which is two ligands, so that's the second complex.

Wait, but wait, I think the complexes can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN- ligands. So the possible species are Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^+, [Co(SCN)_4]^0 (if that's possible). Wait, wait, but the charge on each complex? Let me think: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So:

- [Co(SCN)]^+: Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is 2 -1 = +1. So that's the first complex, Co(SCN)^+.

- [Co(SCN)_2]^2+: 2 SCN- → 2*(-1)= -2. So 2+ -2 = 0 charge? Wait, no, wait wait: Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → charge is 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So [Co(SCN)_2] is neutral? But the problem says "cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes". Hmm, maybe I should check the charges again. Wait, no, wait, the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. Let me think:

Each SCN is -1. So for n SCN, the charge would be 2+ -n*(1) = 2-n. So for n=1, 2-1=+1. n=2, 0. n=3, -1. n=4, -2. So the complexes are all possible.

But how many complexes are possible? The data gives β1 to β4, so four complexes. So n=1 to 4.

Wait, but the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, so each β is the cumulative constant for the nth complex.

Wait, no, no. The stability constant for each step is the equilibrium constant for adding one more ligand. So β1 is the constant for the first complex: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

Then β2 is the equilibrium constant for the second ligand: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β2=40.

Similarly, β3 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, β3=63.

And β4 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^3- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^4-, β4=16.

Wait, but wait. The way stability constants work is as stepwise formation constants. So each β represents the formation of the next complex from the previous one plus a ligand.

So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

So for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, the overall β would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

Wait, but when we're dealing with the distribution, we have to calculate the fractions of each species based on the β's and the concentrations of SCN-.

So the general approach is to model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the concentration of SCN-.

The formula for the fraction of each species is based on the cumulative formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction of the nth complex is (β1β2...βn) * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no, more accurately, each [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) has a concentration given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β1 β2 ... βn * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n / (divided by the product of the charges? Or perhaps I'm mixing it up.)

Wait, maybe I should model it as the formation of each complex.

The total concentration of all Co species is equal to the total cobalt concentration, which is given as 1e-2 M.

So the sum of [Co^2+], [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, [Co(SCN)_4]^4- equals 1e-2 M.

But how do we calculate the fraction of each species?

I think the general approach is to use the stability constants and the ligand concentration to compute the fraction of each complex. The formula for the fraction f_n of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, yes, because each step's formation contributes to the overall concentration. So each term in the denominator represents the concentration of the nth complex, which is [Co^2+] times the product of the β's and [SCN^-]^n. Wait, but [Co^2+] is the same for all terms because it's the starting point. So if we let [Co^2+] = c, then:

[Co^2+] = c / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But, since the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species, which equals c. So we can model this with the denominator being the sum of the terms multiplied by [Co^2+], and that sum equals c.

But perhaps a better way is to calculate the fraction f_n for each species, which is the concentration of that species divided by the total cobalt concentration.

So f_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total.

So [Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / D, where D = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

So the fraction f_n is (β1...βn [SCN]^n) / D.

Wait, that makes sense. So the denominator D is the sum of all the possible terms for each complex. Each term is the product of β's up to that complex's level, multiplied by [SCN] to the number of ligands.

So for our case, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, calculate each β product:

β1 =9,

β1β2=9*40=360,

β1β2β3=360*63=22680,

β1β2β3β4=22680*16=362880.

Now, compute each term in D:

Term 0: 1 (corresponds to Co^2+),
Term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9,
Term2: β1β2 [SCN]^2=360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6,
Term3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3=22680*(0.1)^3 =22680 *0.001=22.68,
Term4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Now sum all terms to get D:

D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's calculate step by step:

1 + 0.9 =1.9,

1.9 +3.6=5.5,

5.5 +22.68=28.18,

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now the fraction f_n for each species:

f_0 (Co^2+) = 1 / D = 1/64.468 ≈0.01551,

f_1 ([CoSCN]^+) = (β1 [SCN]) / D =0.9 /64.468 ≈0.01396,

f_2 ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+) = (β1β2 [SCN]^2) / D =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05555,

f_3 ([Co(SCN)_3]^3-) =22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3518,

f_4 ([Co(SCN)_4]^4-) =36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5629.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let me check these calculations again. Because when I sum all f_n, they should add up to 1.

Let's compute each f_n:

f_0=1/64.468 ≈0.01551,

f_1=0.9/64.468≈0.01396,

f_2=3.6/64.468≈0.05555,

f_3=22.68/64.468≈0.3518,

f_4=36.288/64.468≈0.5629.

Adding these up: 0.01551 + 0.01396 ≈0.0295, +0.05555≈0.085, +0.3518≈0.4368, +0.5629≈0.9997. Hmm, it's approximately 1, which makes sense.

So the blue dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which is the second complex, so f_2 is approximately 0.05555, or about 5.555%.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is 16.9%, 25.6%, etc. Wait, this can't be right because the answer isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I got the order of the complexes wrong. Let me think again. Each β is the stepwise formation constant. So:

The first complex is [CoSCN]^+, with β1=9.

The second complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, with β2=40.

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier gives f_2 as ~5.5%, which isn't one of the options. So that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms in D. Let me recompute the terms.

Wait, so [SCN] is 0.1 M. So:

Term0 =1,

Term1=β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9,

Term2=β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6,

Term3=β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68,

Term4=β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So summing these gives 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468. That's correct.

So f_2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05555 or 5.555%.

But this isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding which complex is the blue one.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is a different one. I thought [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, but maybe it's [Co(SCN)_3]^3- or another complex.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the colors of these complexes. Let me think: I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is usually blue. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, does [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ have a particular color? Or perhaps [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the ligand count and the color.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato as [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which is the second complex. But in that case, our calculation says 5.5% which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β1*β2, but wait no, the β's are the stepwise formation constants, so the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β1 * β2.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something in the way the fractions are calculated. Let me double-check.

Another approach: the fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n ) / sum_{k=0 to 4} (β1β2...βk [SCN]^k )

Which is what I did. So f_2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.555%.

But the answer options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the terms more accurately.

Term0: 1 → 1.

Term1: β1 * [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) times 0.001 →22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Let me compute that again:

9 *40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880.

(0.1)^4 = 0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

Adding all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9,

+3.6=5.5,

+22.68=28.18,

+36.288=64.468.

So denominator D=64.468.

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05555 or 5.555%.

Hmm. But the options given are:

A) 42.3%

B) 25.6%

C) 38.1%

D) 16.9%

None of these match 5.5%.

So I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue complex, which is [Co(SCN)_3]^3- or [Co(SCN)_4]^3- or another complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato as two SCN- ligands, but perhaps the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's only about 5.5%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the stability constants. Let me check the order.

Wait, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, β4 is smaller than β3. Hmm, that's a bit unusual but possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the overall β for the second complex as β2. Let me think: perhaps the problem is considering the β for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ as β2=40, not the product of β1 and β2.

But no, because β2 is the stepwise constant, so the overall is β1*β2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions again using a different approach.

Wait, another way: the fraction of each species can be found by considering the stepwise addition.

The fraction of the nth species is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (sum for k=0 to 4 terms).

Hmm, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the denominator. Let me recompute D.

Wait, 1 is term0:1.

Term1:0.9,

Term2:3.6,

Term3:22.68,

Term4:36.288.

Adding these: 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in β3? Let me recheck the β's.

The problem states: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_4]^3-? Let's see.

f_4=36.288 /64.468≈0.5629 or 56.29%. That's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^3-.

f_3=22.68 /64.468≈0.3518 or 35.18%, which is close to option C (38.1%) but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, but 35% isn't an option. The closest is option C:38.1%, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recalculate the terms.

Wait, for term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3.

Compute β1=9, β2=40, β3=63:

9 *40=360; 360*63=22680.

[SCN]^3 = (0.1)^3=0.001.

So 22680 *0.001=22.68. Correct.

Term4: β1β2β3β4=9×40×63×16.

Compute step by step:

9×40=360.

360×63=22680.

22680×16=362880.

[SCN]^4=0.1^4=0.0001.

362880 ×0.0001=36.288. Correct.

Hmm. So the calculations seem correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is about the dithiocyanate ion, which is S_2N^−, but I think the problem uses SCN^- as the thiocyanate ion.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the β's. Maybe β1 is for the second complex, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the percentage of blue color, which might be due to the presence of multiple complexes, but I don't see how that would work.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are in the reverse order. For example, the first complex has β4=16, and so on. But no, the problem states β1=9, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. But according to the calculation, it's about 5.5%, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the fractions as percentages.

Wait, for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, f_2 is 5.555% → ~5.56%. The options don't include that.

Wait, maybe the calculation of D is wrong. Let me re-calculate D.

D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68+36.288=64.468. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ but about [Co(SCN)_3]^3-.

f_3=22.68/64.468=0.3518 →35.18%.

But the options don't have that either. The closest is option C:38.1%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of term3 or term4.

Wait, let me recompute the products:

β1=9,

β2=40,

β3=63,

β4=16.

Calculating:

β1=9,

β1β2=9*40=360,

β1β2β3=360*63=22680,

β1β2β3β4=22680*16=362880.

Yes, correct.

[SCN] concentrations:

[SCN] =0.1 M.

So,

Term0:1,

Term1:9*0.1=0.9,

Term2:360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6,

Term3:22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68,

Term4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum is 64.468.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which would include both [CoSCN]^+ and [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

In that case, f1 +f2= 0.9/64.468 +3.6/64.468 = (4.5)/64.468 ≈ 0.0698 or ~6.98%.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about all the [Co(SCN)_n] species, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the fractions. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the logarithm of the stability constants, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which are [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So according to the calculation, it's 5.5%. But that's not an option, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the stability constants are given for the overall complexes, not the stepwise. So β1 is the overall for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc.

Wait, that would change the approach. Let me consider that possibility.

If β1 is the overall formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, then β1=9.

β2 is the overall for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, so β2=40.

β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3- is 63.

β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4- is 16.

In that case, the fractions would be calculated using each β as the overall constant for that complex.

So the formula for f_n would be:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no, that's not the usual approach. Because each β would then be the overall constant for that complex.

Wait, perhaps each β is the overall, not stepwise. So for example, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ has β2=40, which is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

In that case, the fraction for each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum over all (βk [SCN]^k) + [Co^2+] )

Wait, but [Co^2+] is [Co^2+] = [Co_total] / (1 + sum(βk [SCN]^k for k=1 to4 ) )

Wait, but in this case, the denominator would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So the fraction f_n is (βn [SCN]^n) / denominator.

Let me try this approach.

So, [SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute each term:

term1: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9,

term2: β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4,

term3: β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063,

term4: β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Denominator D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Now, the fraction f_n for each complex:

f_1:0.9 /2.3646 ≈0.3799 →37.99%,

f_2:0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%,

f_3:0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%,

f_4:0.0016/2.3646≈0.000677 →0.0677%.

So the fractions are approximately 37.99%, 16.9%, 2.66%, 0.0677%.

Wait, now the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which is f_2=16.9% → option D.

Ah, this matches option D) 16.9%.

So, this suggests that the initial approach was incorrect because I assumed the βs were stepwise, but perhaps the problem treats them as overall constants.

But wait, the problem states "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants are typically given as overall constants, not stepwise. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall constant for the nth complex.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the stepwise approach is more common in such problems. But given that the answer option matches when treating βs as overall constants, perhaps that's the intended approach.

Wait, but in the first approach, the βs were stepwise, leading to a small fraction for the second complex. But when treated as overall, the fraction for the second complex is about 16.9%, which is option D.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be D) 16.9%.

But I'm a bit uncertain because I'm not entirely sure whether the βs are stepwise or overall.

Wait, another resource: The stability constant (formation constant) is usually the overall constant for the entire complex. So, for example, the formation constant Kf for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

In that case, the fractions are calculated as I did in the second approach, leading to f_2=16.9%.

So the correct answer would be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN^-] = 0.1 M). The stability constants are interpreted as overall formation constants for the nth complex, not stepwise constants.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**: The fraction of each cobalt complex is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
   \]
   where \( \beta_n \) is the overall stability constant for the nth complex, and the denominator represents the sum of all possible cobalt species.

2. **Compute Terms in Denominator**:
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)
   - Denominator: \( 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646 \)

3. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+**:
   The fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+) is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
