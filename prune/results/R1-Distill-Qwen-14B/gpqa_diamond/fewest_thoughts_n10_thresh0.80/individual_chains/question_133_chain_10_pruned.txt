Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We've got a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL) that contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights (Mw) are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm. So, the solution contains two different phosphate salts. I remember that phosphate buffers work by having a weak acid and its conjugate base, but since both of these salts are present, maybe they form a buffer solution. Wait, KH2PO4 is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which is H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is the sodium hydrogen phosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

So, when these salts dissolve in water, they'll dissociate. KH2PO4 will dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O will dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, along with water of crystallization, but since the problem mentions T = 25°C, I think the water of crystallization is part of the solid, so when dissolved, it contributes just the ions.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The three dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, the first dissociation is the strongest, then each subsequent one is weaker.

In the solution, we have both H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So, in the solution, these two will form a buffer system. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-. So, this is a buffer solution involving the second dissociation step (Ka2). Because the two species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, the H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base here for the second dissociation. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So, I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for this buffer.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). 

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

But wait, wait. I think I have the acid and base mixed up. Since the reaction is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-, the H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the base. So the Henderson equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the solution, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present. So, we can first find the concentrations of each, then use the Henderson equation to find pH, but perhaps we can find the ratio of their concentrations, which will help in finding the actual concentration of HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, since both salts contribute to the solution, maybe we can compute the molarity of each ion and then apply the buffer equation.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each salt.

First, for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.0
