Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy stuff yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in a specific reaction. Oh right! They're used for the hydrolysis of an alkyl chloride to an acid, but wait, no, that's maybe another reaction. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and iodine are used in the Hinsberg reaction, which tests if an amide is present. Hmm, but that's maybe not it. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in some substitution reactions, like maybe in the formation of an acid from an ester or something else.

Wait, another thought: when an alkyl halide reacts with HI, it's likely an SN2 substitution. But wait, red phosphorus—I think it's part of the reaction where an alkyl bromide or chloride reacts with HI to form an alkyl iodide. Or wait, red phosphorus is used to convert an alcohol into a better leaving group. Oh wait, wait. The other possibility is that the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe Compound X is an ester, and the reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. But then, the reagents here don't seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out what Compound X is from its spectral data, and then think about the reaction. Because knowing the structure of X will make it easier to determine the product.

So looking at the IR data: 

The IR peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely an O-H stretch. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid). Then, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, probably an aromatic ring with substituents, and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

The peaks are at:
10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a broad singlet. 10 ppm is very upfield for an aromatic proton, but wait, no, 10 ppm is actually downfield. I think that's likely an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait. Alternatively, a phenolic OH would show up around 5 ppm, but maybe in D2O exchange, but perhaps not. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm. Oh wait, in the NMR, it's 10.5 ppm. So that's probably a carboxylic acid proton, as it's a broad singlet, which could be due to exchange broadening.

Wait, but the options don't all have a carboxylic acid. Let me check the options.

Options:
A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid – that's a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group.
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene – that's cumene, with isobutyl and methyl groups on benzene.
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid – benzene with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid.
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene – another isomer of cumene.

So, if the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, that's probably a carboxylic acid proton. So options A and C are possibilities.

Looking further at the NMR data.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): these are typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. Each pair is a doublet, which suggests they're adjacent to substituents. So perhaps the benzene has two substituents in the para positions.

The 8.0 ppm is higher, so that's more deshielded. 7.2 is less deshielded. So maybe the substituents are an electron-withdrawing group and an electron-donating group. Wait, but all the substituents are on the ring.

Wait, looking at the substituents: in option C, benzoic acid has a -COOH group which is para to a sec-butyl group. The protons on the ring would be deshielded if adjacent to the -COOH (which is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing). So the NMR would show two sets of doublets, one more downfield (next to COOH) and one upfield (next to the alkyl group).

In option A, the propanoic acid is attached to the benzene ring as a substituent. So if the benzene is 4-ethylphenyl attached to propanoic acid, then the ring would have the ethyl group and the propanoic acid in the para positions. The protons adjacent to the propanoic acid group would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm. The ethyl group is electron-donating, so the adjacent protons would be more shielded, lower ppm.

In the NMR data, the two doublets are at 8.0 and 7.2. So the 8.0 is more downfield, perhaps next to a deactivating group like COOH. So for option C, the benzoic acid group is at position 4, and the sec-butyl is at position 1, but wait, it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, so the structure is:

Benzoic acid (COOH) at position 1 (assuming numbering), and the sec-butyl group at position 4. Wait, no, the naming is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, so the COOH is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4.

So the ring will have substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the protons adjacent to the COOH (position 2 and 6) will be downfield, maybe around 8.0 ppm, and the protons adjacent to the sec-butyl (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded, maybe around 7.2 ppm. That matches the NMR data. So that fits.
