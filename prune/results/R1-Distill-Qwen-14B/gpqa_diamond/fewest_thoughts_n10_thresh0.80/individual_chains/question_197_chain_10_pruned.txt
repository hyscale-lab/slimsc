Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of reaction, maybe a substitution or elimination. Oh wait, right! They're used in the Hofmann-Löffler reaction, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Or was that something else? Oh, wait no, I think red phosphorus and HI are used to form ylides, which can then do elimination reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's for the deoxygenation of epoxides? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, they might be used in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation or something else.

But wait, let's first figure out what Compound X is. The question gives IR and NMR data, so I need to analyze that.

Looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That broad range probably indicates an O-H or N-H stretch. Wait, 3400–2500 is a pretty wide range. The strong peak around 3300 would be O-H, maybe in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But the 2500 could be a C-H stretch, but I'm not sure. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have carbonyls around 1700, but maybe esters or ketones higher. Wait, 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. But wait, another peak at 1610 and 1450. Those might be C=C aromatic ring stretches. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals: 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs) for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, and they're usually broad. So 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet suggests a carboxylic acid.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. So if it's para, the two sets of doublets would each integrate to 2H. So that's a benzene ring with two substituents, perhaps in the para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break that down. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to something that splits into a doublet. Maybe a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group. Wait, but wait: the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, so perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to something that causes splitting. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, maybe a CH group attached to something else.

Putting this together: the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted benzene. The substituents would be a carboxylic acid group and another group. Wait, but wait, the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid proton. So the benzene has a COOH group in one position and another substituent in the para position.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m, 2
