Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially when they're uncharged, the charges inside can influence the electric fields in certain ways. The conductor here is uncharged, which is important. So, I think about how charges distribute in such cases.

The conductor is a sphere with radius R, and there's a small cavity inside. The cavity's radius is r, and it's centered at a distance s from the conductor's center. So, the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. Got it. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity.

The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is its distance from the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside.

Hmm, I'm trying to recall the concepts here. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. But the cavity is inside, so the charge +q will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, since the conductor is uncharged, the total induced charge must be zero. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor material can't have a net charge. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance that, because the total conductor charge is zero.

Wait, no. Wait. The conductor is neutral, so any charge inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface. And since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the inner surface's charge but opposite. So inner surface: -q, outer surface: +q. Because the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel it inside the conductor. Then, outer surface is +q because the conductor was neutral, so overall, conductor's charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the outer surface will have +q because the inner surface has -q. So the outer surface's charge is +q because that's what makes the conductor's total charge
