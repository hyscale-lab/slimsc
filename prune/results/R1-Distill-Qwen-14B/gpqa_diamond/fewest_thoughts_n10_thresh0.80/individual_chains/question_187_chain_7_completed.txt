Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what ESPRESSO is. I think it's a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. Oh right, it's designed for things like detecting exoplanets using the radial velocity method, which requires high precision to detect the Doppler shift caused by planets.

The question is about the detectability of certain stars based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The threshold is S/N of at least 10. So, I need to figure out for each star whether the S/N meets or exceeds 10.

Each star has different characteristics. Let me list them:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with abs V mag 15 at 10 pc
d) Star with abs V mag 15 at 200 pc
e) Star with abs V mag 15 at 5 pc
f) Star with abs V mag 15 at 50 pc

Wait, I should think about how the S/N depends on the star's flux. I remember that the S/N for a spectrograph depends on the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) because brighter stars produce more photons, leading to higher S/N.

The formula I recall for S/N is something like S/N = (flux)^(1/2) * sqrt(t) / R, where t is exposure time and R is the resolution element. But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the S/N increases with the square root of the exposure time and the photon flux.

Wait, there's another approach. The V magnitude relates to the flux. The formula for flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * (V - V0)), where V0 is a reference magnitude. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that the apparent magnitude of a star determines how much light it emits towards us. The more photons, the higher the S/N. But for a given instrument, the S/N is a function of the star's apparent brightness.

So, I need to find the apparent magnitude of each star, then determine if the exposure time and instrument parameters would give S/N >=10.

Wait, the ESPRESSO spectrograph's S/N depends on the star's brightness. From the ESO website, I think ESPRESSO can reach S/N of about 10 for a V=15 star in a certain exposure time. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but here's another point. The question gives a 1-hour exposure. So I probably need to calculate for each star whether, in one hour, the S/N per binned pixel is at least 10.

But wait, what's the typical S/N per pixel for ESPRESSO? I think ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N for bright stars. For example, for a V=9 star, it can get like S/N=100 per pixel in an hour, but for fainter stars, the S/N drops.

Alternatively, the ESPRESSO system might have a certain limiting magnitude. So any star brighter than that (lower magnitude) would be detectable.

Wait, I should probably find out how the S/N scales with magnitude. Because each magnitude step is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness. So, if a star is 5 magnitudes brighter, it's 100 times brighter (since 2.512^5 ≈ 100).

I think the formula for S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(V - V0)), assuming that V0 is the magnitude where the S/N is 10. So if the star's magnitude is V, then S/N = 10 * 10^(-0.4*(V - V0)).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The S/N scales with the square root of the number of photons. The number of photons N is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(V - V0)), so S/N is proportional to sqrt(N) = 10^(-0.2*(V - V0)).

So if a star is V0, S/N is 10 per pixel. Then, if a star is V, S/N = 10 * 10^(-0.2*(V - V0)).

Wait, perhaps. So to get S/N >=10, the exponent must be <=0. So 10^(-0.2*(V - V0)) ) >=1.

Which implies that (V - V0) <=0 => V <= V0.

Wait, but that can't be right because if V is brighter (smaller magnitude), then V - V0 is negative, so 10^(-0.2*(negative)) is 10^positive, which is greater than 1. So yeah, then S/N >=10.

Wait, but what is V0? That's the reference magnitude. For ESPRESSO, I think V0 is around 15 or so. Wait, but I'm not sure. I need to look for what the ESPRESSO's typical S/N per hour for a star of certain magnitude.

Wait, I found in my notes (or maybe I'm confusing with something else) that ESPRESSO can reach S/N of 10 for a V=15 star in 1 hour. So that would make V0=15. So any star with V <=15 would have S/N >=10, and those with V>15 would have S/N <10.

But let me check: if a star is V=15, S/N is exactly 10. For V=14, which is one magnitude brighter, the S/N would be 10 * 10^(0.2 * (15-14)) )? Wait, no, perhaps the formula is S/N = 10 * 10^(-0.2*(V - V0)).

Wait, no. Let me model it again. The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(V - V0)). Then, the number of photons N = F * t, where t is exposure time. The S/N is sqrt(N) / R, where R is the resolution. But perhaps for this problem, we can ignore R and other factors, or they're considered constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the S/N scales as S/N = K * 10^(-0.4*(V - V0)) * sqrt(t), where K is some constant.

But wait, the question says the S/N is per binned pixel. So perhaps each pixel's S/N is determined by the amount of flux in that pixel. So if the star's spectrum is spread over more pixels, each pixel has lower S/N.

But regardless, the main point is whether the star is bright enough to reach S/N >=10 per binned pixel in an hour.

So, let's first calculate the apparent magnitude (V) for each star, then compare it to ESPRESSO's capability.

Wait, but how do I compute the apparent magnitude for each star?

The apparent magnitude (m) is related to the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) via the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10 pc).

So for each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a bright star. Its absolute magnitude is about -5.76, and it's about 309 light-years away, which is about 95 pc. So let me calculate m.

M = -5.76, d=95 pc.

m = -5.76 + 5*log10(95/10) = -5.76 + 5 * log10(9.5) ≈ -5.76 +5*(0.978) ≈ -5.76 +4.89 = -0.87. So Canopus is a very bright star, m ~ -0.87.

b) Polaris: Polaris is a star in Ursa Major, the North Star. Its absolute magnitude is about 1.6, and it's about 431 light-years away, which is approximately 131 pc.

m =1.6 +5*log10(131/10) =1.6 +5*log10(13.1) → log10(13.1)≈1.117 → 5*1.117=5.585 → m=1.6 +5.585≈7.185. So Polaris has apparent magnitude ~7.18.

c) Star with M=15, d=10 pc.

m =15 +5*log10(10/10)=15 +5*0=15.

d) M=15, d=200 pc.

m=15 +5*log10(200/10)=15 +5*log10(20)=15+5*(1.301)=15+6.505=21.505.

e) M=15, d=5 pc.

m=15 +5*log10(5/10)=15+5*log10(0.5)=15+5*(-0.301)=15-1.505=13.495.

f) M=15, d=50 pc.

m=15 +5*log10(50/10)=15 +5*log10(5)=15+5*(0.69897)=15+3.495=18.495.

So now, the apparent magnitudes are:

a) ~ -0.87

b) ~7.18

c) 15

d) ~21.5

e) ~13.5

f) ~18.5

Now, I need to find out which of these have m <= V0, where V0 is the magnitude where S/N=10 in 1 hour.

Earlier, I thought that ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 for V=15 in 1 hour. Wait, but according to the calculation, if V0 is 15, then any star with m <=15 would have S/N >=10.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. If a star is brighter (lower m), then it's easier to get a higher S/N. So if V0 is 15, any star with m <15 would have better (higher) S/N. So as long as m <=15, the S/N would be >=10.

Wait, but the question says, for each star, whether the S/N is at least 10. So any star with m <=15 would be detectable.

Looking at each star:

a) m ~-0.87: much brighter than 15 → detectable.

b) m ~7.18: detectable.

c) m=15: exactly at V0 → S/N=10 → detectable.

d) m=21.5: way fainter → S/N <10 → not detectable.

e) m=13.5: <15 → detectable.

f) m=18.5: >15 → not detectable.

So which stars are detectable? a, b, c, e.

Wait, that's four stars. So the options are:

Option A)2

Option B)5

Option C)4

Option D)3

So the answer should be C)4.

Wait, but wait. Are all these stars observable with the VLT? Because the VLT is at Paranal, which is in the southern hemisphere. So Canopus, which is visible from the southern hemisphere, would be observable. But what about Polaris? Polaris is in the northern sky. Can the VLT observe it?

Ah, good point. The VLT is in Chile, at latitude 24.6° South. Polaris is at Dec +89°, so it's almost at the north celestial pole. From latitude -25°, the maximum altitude of Polaris would be about 56° (since 90-25=65; but wait, the declination of Polaris is +89, so its altitude at Dec=+89 and observer at Dec=-25 would be (90 - | -25 - 89 | )? Wait, perhaps it's better to think for a southern observatory, can they see Polaris?

Wait, the VLT is at the ESO Paranal Observatory in Chile. The declination of Polaris is about +89°, which is very far north. So from Paranal, which is at a latitude of about 24.6° South, the maximum elevation of Polaris would be about 65° (since 90 - 24.6 = 65.4). So Polaris is visible, but only from certain times of the year and not all night. But for the purpose of this question, I think it's acceptable to assume that the telescope can observe Polaris if it's in the sky.

Wait, but the question just asks about detectability based on S/N, not on whether the star is visible from the location. So perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the telescope can point to those stars.

Wait, but wait. The RA and DEC for options c, d, e, f are all 0 degrees. RA 0h and Dec 0° is the celestial equator, so it's visible from any latitude, but depends on time of year.

But given that the question states that when coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes, but doesn't restrict based on visibility, I think I can proceed without considering the observatory's latitude, unless the question specifically brings it up, which it doesn't.

So back to the main point, how many have m<=15?

a) m=-0.87 → yes.

b) m=7.18 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

So that's four stars. So the correct answer is 4, which is option C.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope at the Paranal Observatory, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude ($m$) of the star, as brighter stars (lower $m$) produce more photons, leading to higher S/N.

The apparent magnitude ($m$) of a star is calculated using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10 \, \text{pc}),
\]

where $M$ is the absolute magnitude and $d$ is the distance to the star in parsecs. For ESPRESSO, it is assumed that a star with $m = 15$ achieves an S/N of 10 in 1 hour. Thus, any star with $m \leq 15$ is detectable, while stars with $m > 15$ are not.

### Calculations for Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a):**  
   - $M = -5.76$, $d = 95 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - $m = -5.76 + 5 \log_{10}(95/10) = -5.76 + 5(0.978) \approx -0.87$.  
   - $m = -0.87$ (detectable).

2. **Polaris (b):**  
   - $M = 1.6$, $d = 131 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - $m = 1.6 + 5 \log_{10}(131/10) = 1.6 + 5(1.117) \approx 7.18$.  
   - $m = 7.18$ (detectable).

3. **Star c:**  
   - $M = 15$, $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - $m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15 + 5(0) = 15$.  
   - $m = 15$ (detectable).

4. **Star d:**  
   - $M = 15$, $d = 200 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - $m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200/10) = 15 + 5(1.301) \approx 21.5$.  
   - $m = 21.5$ (not detectable).

5. **Star e:**  
   - $M = 15$, $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - $m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 15 + 5(-0.301) \approx 13.5$.  
   - $m = 13.5$ (detectable).

6. **Star f:**  
   - $M = 15$, $d = 50 \, \text{pc}$.  
   - $m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50/10) = 15 + 5(0.699) \approx 18.5$.  
   - $m = 18.5$ (not detectable).

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), Star c, and Star e. A total of **4 stars** meet the S/N requirement of at least 10.
