Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production. Specifically, it's talking about two energy bands of neutrinos: band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. The ratio of their fluxes (flux1/flux2) is what we're looking for. 

The setup is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, wait, wait. Why 8.5 minutes ago? Oh right, because that's approximately the time it takes for light (or neutrinos, which are nearly at light speed) to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So if the pp-III process stopped, the change in neutrino production would be felt here on Earth about 8.5 minutes later. But since the problem says the pp-III branch stopped, but all other reactions remained as they were, I need to think about what the pp-III branch contributes to neutrino flux.

I remember that the pp chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun, and it produces neutrinos through several reactions. The pp-III branch is one of the steps in this chain. Oh wait, the pp chain has different branches. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which involves a couple of steps, including the fusion of two protons to form deuterium and a positron, and then the fusion of deuterium with another proton to make tritium. Then, the tritium fuses with another proton to form helium-4, emitting two positrons and two electrons along the way, which produces neutrinos.

Wait, but the question is about the pp-III branch. Maybe I should recall what each branch produces. I think the pp-I and pp-II branches produce different isotopes. Oh, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is not a branch but a specific part of the chain that leads to the production of a certain type of neutrino. 

Wait, I think the main neutrinos from the Sun come from the decay of boron-8, which is produced in the CNO cycle. Oh, but wait, no—the CNO cycle is another fusion process, but the Sun is mostly powered by the proton-proton chain. Oh, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch refers to a specific neutrino emission process.

Wait, maybe I should think about the neutrino emission processes. The dominant neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos (ν_e) produced in the proton-proton chain. The main sources are the two stages where positrons are emitted: the first step (pp → deuterium + positron + neutrino) and the third step (tritium + proton → helium-4 + 2 positrons + 2 neutrinos). So the majority of the neutrinos come from the third step, which is part of the pp-III branch.

So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, that would mean that the main source of neutrinos is no longer active. But wait, the question says that only the pp-III branch stopped, not the others.
