Okay, so I need to figure out this neutrino flux ratio problem. Let me start by understanding the question. 

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. So, all other reactions are still happening as usual. I'm supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is flux(band1)/flux(band2).

Hmm, wait. Neutrinos produced in the Sun are mainly from the proton-proton (pp) chain, right? And the pp chain has several branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches produce different amounts of neutrinos. I think the pp-III branch is the dominant one, so if it stops, the overall neutrino flux should drop, especially in certain energy ranges.

Wait, no, the question says the pp-III branch stopped. So the other branches like pp-I and pp-II are still active. Oh wait, no, the problem states that only the pp-III branch stopped. So the other branches continue as usual. So, the neutrino production from those branches is unaffected.

But wait, the pp-III branch produces a specific type of neutrino. Let me recall: the pp chain produces electron neutrinos (Î½_e), and the specific reactions contribute to different energy spectra. The pp-III branch is one of the higher steps, so it's probably producing higher energy neutrinos?

Wait, no. The pp chain has different steps. The main pp-I branch produces lower energy neutrinos, and the pp-III branch might be a higher energy process. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III is part of a more energetic part of the chain, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is more about producing heavier elements, but I'm not sure. Wait, the pp chain is the primary fusion process in the Sun, right? It's the proton-proton chain, where protons fuse into deuterium, then tritium, then helium. The main branch is pp-I, which involves the fusion of a deuterium and a proton to make helium-3 and a positron and a neutrino. The pp-II and pp-III are variations, perhaps involving different paths, maybe with higher mass or different reaction steps.
