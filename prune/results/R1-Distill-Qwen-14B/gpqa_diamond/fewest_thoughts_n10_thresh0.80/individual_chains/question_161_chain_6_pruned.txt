Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: Mike is designing a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron beam, right? But even with that, some gas particles are still there. He measures the mean free path as λ1 using factors like compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. 

Wait, mean free path. I remember that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula is λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the collision diameter. Oh, but wait, it's also dependent on pressure and temperature because n, the number density, depends on pressure via the ideal gas law. Since pressure is low (ultra-high vacuum), the mean free path should be long.

So, when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. But the temperature is the same, so n should be the same as before. Wait, but why would the mean free path change? Oh, maybe because the electron beam is somehow affecting the gas molecules.

Wait, the electron beam has a high energy—1000 kV is a lot. When electrons with such high energy pass through the gas, they might cause ionization or other interactions. So, I guess the gas molecules could get charged. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Oh, charged particles in a vacuum would interact differently. But wait, in a vacuum, the electric fields are usually negligible unless there's a charged state. Or perhaps when the gas ions are produced, they can scatter electrons more effectively. Alternatively, maybe the charged gas molecules have different cross-sections for scattering electrons. 

Wait, but wait, the mean free path is about how often gas molecules collide with each other, right? Or wait, no, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being excited or ionized, and that could change their effective cross-section. Or maybe the electron beam is causing the gas to change in another way, like heating, but the question says the temperature is the same.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to interact with the electrons, but that might affect electron scattering rather than the gas molecules' mean free path. Or perhaps the mean free path in this context refers to the electron's mean free path, but no, the question says Mike is talking about the gas molecules' mean free path based on electron scattering.

Wait, let me re-read the question. Mike was determining the mean free path of the gas molecules. But after starting the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path based on electron scattering. Hmm, maybe the gas molecules are now scattering electrons more, so the electrons' mean free path in the gas is shorter. But wait, the question says the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ2. Or is it the mean free path of the electrons?

Wait, the question says: "He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same." So it's the gas molecules' mean free path. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path of gas molecules is a property of the gas, determined by their density and collision cross-section. If the temperature is the same, the pressure is the same, so the mean free path should remain λ1. But Mike observes λ2. Hmm, so why is that?

Oh wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it causes the gas to ionize, creating charged particles. Charged particles would have different behavior. But wait, charged particles in a vacuum might experience electrostatic forces, but in a vacuum, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the gas is partially ionized, the mean free path would change because the effective cross-section for collisions would be different.

Wait, another thought: When the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can cause more collisions with the gas molecules, perhaps leading to more ionization. But wait, how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the mean free path changes because the effective diameter changes. For example, if the gas becomes partially ionized, the ions might have a larger effective size, leading to more frequent collisions. Or maybe the ions have a different way of moving, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the gas molecules are ionized, they might actually move more freely because they're charged and perhaps don't collide as frequently. Or does ionization increase or decrease the mean free path?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the factors affecting the mean free path. The
