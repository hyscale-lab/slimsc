Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the velocity of particle A in an annihilation process. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, an antiproton and a proton annihilate each other and produce two particles each of charge + and -. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV. Wait, m_A c² is 300 MeV, right.

The question is about the velocity of particle A. The options are different fractions of the speed of light. So, like 0.77c, 0.96c, etc.

I remember that in such annihilation processes, energy and momentum conservation are key. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, I think that implies that the initial kinetic energy is low compared to their rest mass energies. Or maybe it's just that the antiproton's speed is low, so we can approximate it as being at rest. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," so maybe its velocity is negligible compared to the speed of light. So perhaps, for the sake of approximation, we can take the initial momentum as just that of the proton. Or maybe even consider the proton as moving and the antiproton at rest? Or perhaps the opposite? Wait, the question says the antiproton is moving slowly, not the proton. So the proton might be moving, but probably the antiproton is stationary or moving at a low speed, so maybe we can neglect its velocity compared to the proton's.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the antiproton is the one that's moving slowly. So perhaps, the proton is moving at some speed, and the antiproton is moving very slowly. Hmm, but the initial setup is p + p̄ annihilating into two A+ and A- each. So, in the center of momentum frame, but maybe in the lab frame, one is moving and the other is at rest? Or perhaps it's more complex.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe we can approximate that it's at rest. So the initial setup is a proton and an antiproton, with the antiproton at rest, and the proton perhaps moving with some velocity. Or wait, maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's velocity is negligible. Alternatively, perhaps the system's initial momentum is dominated by the proton's motion.

Wait,
