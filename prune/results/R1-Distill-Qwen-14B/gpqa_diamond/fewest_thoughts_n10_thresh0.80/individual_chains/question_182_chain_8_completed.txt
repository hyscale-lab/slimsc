Okay, I'm trying to figure out which statement about the Mott-Gurney equation is correct. Let me start by remembering what the equation represents. The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior in a semiconductor device when it's in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. From what I recall, in this regime, the current is limited by the build-up of charge in the space-charge region, which affects the electric field and thus the current.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I think ε is the permittivity or dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage, and L is the length of the device, maybe the thickness of the semiconductor layer.

Now, the question is about the conditions under which this equation is valid. The options are A to D, each describing different device characteristics.

I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation applies in a specific scenario. It's derived under certain assumptions. Let me list what I think are the key assumptions:

1. The device is single-carrier, meaning it's either electrons or holes, not both. Because if it's a two-carrier device, you'd have to consider both electrons and holes, and the derivation might be more complicated. So options that mention two-carrier devices (like D) are probably incorrect.

2. The device should be trap-free. Traps would complicate the current transport because they can cause carrier trapping and emission, which would lead to different current behavior, maybe more like the Fowler-Nordheim equation in some cases.

3. The contacts are Ohmic. Ohmic contacts mean that the metal-semiconductor junctions have zero or negligible barrier height, so the carriers can move freely without needing to overcome a Schottky barrier. If the contacts were Schottky, then there would be a barrier, and the current might have different dependencies.

4. The current is limited by the space charge, so it's the SCLC regime. In this case, the dominant current is due to the acceleration of carriers in the varying electric field, not due to drift or diffusion. So drift and diffusion currents are negligible. 

Let me look at each option:

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Hmm. So single-carrier, trap-free, Ohmic contacts. Also, negligible drift current. Wait, if drift is negligible, then maybe the equation wouldn't apply. Or wait, the SCLC is when the space charge dominates, so drift might be the main mechanism. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Or perhaps in SCLC, the drift current is what's limited. So if drift is negligible, that might not fit.

Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is for when the current is limited by the space-charge, so in that case, drift current is the dominant, but under certain conditions, like when the space charge builds up, the electric field becomes non-linear, leading to a J proportional to V squared. So in that case, drift is important, but maybe the equation doesn't account for diffusion. So perhaps the correct condition is negligible diffusion current? Because in the derivation, I think the diffusion term is neglected, assuming that the space-charge region is such that the carriers are primarily drifting under the electric field, not diffusing.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion. No carrier injection barrier implies the contacts are Ohmic, since injection barriers would be like Schottky barriers. So this option says it's a single-carrier, trap-free, Ohmic contacts (since no injection barrier), and negligible diffusion current. That sounds correct because the Mott-Gurney derivation neglects diffusion. So J is due to drift.

Option C: Single-carrier, Schottky contact (so non-Ohmic), negligible diffusion. If it's a Schottky contact, then there's a barrier, which might mean that the device isn't in the SCLC regime because the current could be limited by the tunneling or the barrier. In the Mott-Gurney case, I think the contacts are assumed to be ideal (Ohmic) so that the carriers can move without significant barriers, making the space-charge the limiting factor. So a Schottky contact might not fit the Mott-Gurney conditions.

Option D: Two-carrier device, Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion. Since the Mott-Gurney equation is for single-carrier, two-carrier (like in a PN junction diode) would not fit. So D is incorrect.

So, back to options A and B. Let's think about the drift and diffusion.

In the Mott-Gurney derivation, I believe that the diffusion current is neglected. That's because in the space-charge-limited region, the dominant current is drift, and the diffusion is considered negligible because the carriers are driven by the electric field, not their concentration gradients. So the equation assumes that the diffusion current is negligible.

Option A says negligible drift current. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because Mott-Gurney is about the current when drift is the main component, so if drift is negligible, the equation wouldn't apply. So A's statement about negligible drift current would make the equation invalid.

Option B says negligible diffusion current, which matches the assumption. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Ohmic contact implies that the built-in potential is zero, so the carriers can move without needing to overcome a barrier. So when a voltage is applied, the only limitation is the space-charge effect, which causes the current to vary as V squared.

So option B is trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (i.e., Ohmic), and negligible diffusion current. That fits.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation, \( J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3} \), assumes specific conditions for its validity. These include:

1. **Single-carrier device**: The device should involve only one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes), as the equation does not account for the simultaneous presence of both electrons and holes.

2. **Trap-free operation**: The presence of traps would complicate the current transport by introducing carrier trapping and emission, which are not considered in the Mott-Gurney derivation.

3. **Ohmic contacts**: The device should have zero or negligible carrier injection barriers, meaning the contacts are Ohmic. This ensures that carriers can move freely without needing to overcome a Schottky barrier.

4. **Negligible diffusion current**: The dominant current in the SCLC regime is drift current, as the carriers are accelerated by the electric field. Diffusion currents are assumed to be negligible in this regime.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation applies when drift current is significant, as it is the dominant mechanism in the SCLC regime. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. This matches the assumptions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is derived, making this option correct.

- **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier, which would limit the current and make the equation invalid. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation is specific to single-carrier devices, so this option is also incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.

Answer: B
