Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps, so I'll have to break them down.

First, the reaction steps:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, each is a cyclic ketone with various substituents.

Let me start by analyzing the reactions step by step.

Reaction 1: A + HCN → B.
HCN is a nucleophile. When a carbonyl (like a ketone) reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, but the IR of A is 1750 cm^-1, which is more in line with a ketone (since aldehydes have peaks around 1720-1700 and maybe a bit higher if conjugated, but ketones are usually around 1715-1740). Wait, the IR of E is 1715 cm^-1, which is also a carbonyl group. So E is a ketone.

So, if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN gives a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin would have an -OH and -CN group added to the same carbon as the ketone.

Reaction 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation of a nitrile group. Wait, but B is the product of A and HCN, so if B is a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH and an -CN group on adjacent carbons (because it's a secondary alcohol and nitrile on the same carbon as where the ketone was). Wait, no: the cyanohydrin is formed by the addition of HCN to the carbonyl, so the structure would have the -OH and -CN on adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe I should think of the structure. 

Let me imagine A is a cyclopentanone. Then, reacting with HCN would add across the carbonyl, giving a cyanohydrin. So, for example, cyclopentanone would form 3-hydroxycyanocyclopentane, but that's a general idea.

Wait, but when you have a cyclic ketone, adding HCN would form a secondary alcohol and a nitrile on adjacent carbons. Then, when B is hydrogenated, the nitrile group (-CN) would be reduced. But wait, what's the hydrogenation of a nitrile? Typically, under hydrogenation conditions, a nitrile (RCN) is reduced to an amine (RCH2NH2), but wait, wait—no, with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, maybe it's more about adding hydrogen across triple bonds. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: when you hydrogenate a nitrile (RCN), it typically becomes RCH2NH2. But in the presence of a catalyst like palladium, perhaps under certain conditions, it could reduce the nitrile to an amine. However, another possibility is that the nitrile group is hydrogenated to a methylene group (
