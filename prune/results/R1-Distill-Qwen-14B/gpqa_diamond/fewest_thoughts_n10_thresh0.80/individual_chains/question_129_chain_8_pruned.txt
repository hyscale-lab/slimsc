Okay, so I need to figure out what compound E is in this reaction scheme. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the question gives me a series of reactions starting from compound A and leading all the way to E. Also, there are some hints provided, which should help in determining the structure.

Let me start by understanding each step:

1. **Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.**
   HCN is a nucleophile. In organic chemistry, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, it would also react, but the product would be different. But given the next steps, maybe A is a cycloketone.

2. **Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.**
   Hydrogenation with palladium usually indicates catalytic hydrogenation. If B is a nitrile (from HCN addition), then reducing it would give an amine. Wait, but HCN adds as a cyanide group. So maybe B has a cyano group. Alternatively, if B is a ketone cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol. Hmm, wait, let's think again. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with an alcohol group and a cyano group attached to adjacent carbons. So for example, cyclohexanone reacting with HCN would give a cyanohydrin where the OH and CN are on adjacent carbons.

   Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, perhaps the cyano group (-CN) is reduced to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but wait, more accurately, the CN group reduces to CH2NH2? Or wait, under hydrogenation conditions, nitriles (CN) are typically reduced to amines (CH2NH2) via intermediates like imine or amine. Alternatively, maybe the cyano group is converted into an amine group, but I'm not sure. But wait, another possibility is that the ketone in A is converted to an alcohol in B if the reaction is something else, but no, HCN addition is more likely the cyanohydrin formation.

   Alternatively, perhaps B
