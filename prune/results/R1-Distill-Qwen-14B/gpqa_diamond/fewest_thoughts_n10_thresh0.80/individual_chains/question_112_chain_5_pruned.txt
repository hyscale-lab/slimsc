Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again.

The question says that there's an electron described by a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I think these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The problem asks me to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j and zero otherwise. Wait, that's interesting. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (A_12 and A_21) are hbar/2 each.

Wait, but wait. The matrix for this operator would look like:

[  0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0   ]

Because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So this is a 2x2 matrix, right? So that must mean the operator is acting on a two-level system, like the spin of an electron which can be up or down.

But wait, the operator given here is a 2x2 matrix. So probably, the eigenstates we need to find are the eigenstates of this operator. Because the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of that operator.

Wait, but first, I need to normalize the state |alpha>, because it's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So perhaps the first step is to find the normalization constant.

Let me compute the norm of the state. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The inner product is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. So compute |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2.

|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So adding them, 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7), so |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

Now, the operator whose matrix is A_ij. As I wrote, it's a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, what's the operator? Let me think. The standard Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. But this matrix looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so scaling by hbar/2 makes each off-diagonal element hbar/2, diagonals zero.

So the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of this operator would be (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so ±hbar/2.

But what are the eigenstates? The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the operator. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the states |+x> and |-x>, the spin states aligned along the x-axis.

So, the eigenstates of the operator A are |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitude of |alpha> in each eigenstate |+x> and |-x>.

So the first step is to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but to find the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, we need to find the eigenvectors of A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. Let me think about how to do that.

Alternatively, since the operator A is proportional to sigma_x, perhaps we can find the expansion of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

The standard eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), assuming up is spin-up along z, and down is spin-down.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The eigenstates of sigma_x are:

|+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> )

|−x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> − |down> )

Because sigma_x |+x> = +1 * |+x> ?

Wait, let me verify. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when it acts on |+x>, which is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), it should return |+x> multiplied by 1.

Let me compute sigma_x |+x>:

sigma_x * [1/sqrt(2); 1/sqrt(2)] = [ [0,1; 1,0] * [1;1] ] / sqrt(2) = [1; 1] / sqrt(2) = |+x>, so yes, eigenvalue +1.

Similarly, sigma_x |−x> = -|−x>.

So, the eigenstates are as I wrote.

So, to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of these states.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is given in the |up>, |down> basis, perhaps it's easier to compute the components of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

So, the state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7)

Let me write this as a vector:

In the |up>, |down> basis, the components are a = (1+i)/sqrt(7) and b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So the state is [ a; b ].

Now, to find the components of |alpha> in the |+x> and |−x> basis, we can compute the inner products.

That is, the amplitude for |+x> is < +x | alpha >, and similarly for |−x>.

Because |+x> and |-x> form an orthonormal basis, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +1 (for sigma_x) is |< +x | alpha >|², and similarly for −1.

Wait, but since the operator A is (hbar/2)
