Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can be tricky. Let's see what I can do. The question is about determining the number of 13C NMR signals for compound E after a series of reactions. Hmm, I'll need to figure out the structure of E first.

The starting material is propionaldehyde. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO, right? So, that's an aldehyde group with two CH2 groups attached. The first reaction is with EDT and BF3. Wait, what's EDT? Oh, EDT is Ethyl Diisopropyl Tin. I think that's a catalyst used in some kind of reaction. Oh, right! It's used in the Wittig reaction. So, the Wittig reagent would form, and the aldehyde would react to form an alkene.

So, propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacting with a Wittig reagent (generated from EDT and BF3) would form an alkene. The Wittig reaction typically converts aldehydes to alkenes. The product A would be CH3CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the Wittig replaces the aldehyde oxygen with a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait: the general reaction is aldehyde + ylide â†’ alkene. So if I have CH3CH2CHO reacting with a ylide from a Wittig reagent, the aldehyde (CHO) becomes CH2, and the ylide's R groups come in. Wait, but wait. The starting aldehyde is propionaldehyde, which is CH3CH2CHO. So when the Wittig reagent (like from CH2= something) attacks, it would replace the aldehyde group with a CH2 group, creating a new double bond.

Wait, but if the ylide is from, say, CH2=PR3, then the aldehyde would become CH2CH2... wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The Wittig reaction adds a double bond. The aldehyde becomes an alkene. So for propionaldehyde, the product A would be an alkene. So propionaldehyde is RCHO. The Wittig would replace the O with a CH2 group, but wait, the structure after reaction would be RCH2CH2? No, no, wait. No, the general product is RCH=CH2 if the ylide is from CH2 group. Wait, maybe I should think about the ylide structure. Wait, but in this case, the first reagent is EDT, which is a strong base used to
