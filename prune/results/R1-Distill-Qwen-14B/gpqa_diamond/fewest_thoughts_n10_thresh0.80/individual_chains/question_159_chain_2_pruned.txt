Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops a lot. I remember something about quasars and their emission lines. Oh right, this might be related to the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet, right? But when quasars are at high redshifts, their light is redshifted, so the observed wavelength would be longer than the emitted one.

Lyman-alpha is emitted at about 121.6 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's way longer. So the redshift z would be (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5, so z is 6.5 -1 = 5.5? Wait, wait. Let's do that more accurately. 790 divided by 121.6. Hmm, 121.6 * 6 is 729.6, which is less than 790. 121.6 * 6.5 is 789.8. Oh, so 6.5 times. So z is 6.5 -1 = 5.5. So z is about 5.5.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is the distance we use in cosmology, which relates to the scale factor a. At z=5.5, a is (1/(1+z)) = 1/6.5 ≈ 0.1538.

The parameters given are: Hubble constant H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, flat universe. So flat universe means Omega_m + Omega_lambda =1, which matches here.

I need to find the comoving distance for a=1, which would be the comoving distance to the quasar. The comoving distance formula is D_C = (c/H0) * integral from 0 to z of 1/sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z')^3*(1 - a')^3? Wait, no. Wait, dark energy's equation of state is usually w=-1, so its density scales as (1+z)^3(a)^-3, but a= (1/(1+z)), so (1+z)=1/a. So the dark energy density is Omega_lambda*(a^3), wait no, wait:

Wait, the general formula for comoving distance is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1 / E(z')] dz'

Where E(z) = sqrt( Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{3(1+w)} } )

But for dark energy with w=-1, which is the standard cosmological model (Lambda-CDM), the dark energy term becomes (1+z)^3 * (Omega_lambda) * (1/(1+z)^3) )? Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, in the standard model, dark energy (lambda) density scales as (1+z)^-3, because it's a cosmological constant. So the total energy density at redshift z is:

E(z)^2 = Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^0 = Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda

So E(z) = sqrt( Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda )

So for our case, z=5.5.

So I need to compute the integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz', then multiply by c/H0.

Hmm, but I don't remember the exact value for this integral at z=5.5. I think this is where some approximate formula or look-up table would be useful.
