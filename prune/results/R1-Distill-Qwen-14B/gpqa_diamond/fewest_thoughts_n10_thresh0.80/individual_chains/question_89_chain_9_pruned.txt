Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid and has a lot of methyl groups attached to a central structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it's heated with vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides), I think it leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules and form an alkene. Wait, but wait—vicinal dihalide elimination gives alkenes, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is 1,3-dibromo, so that's not a vicinal dihalide. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Oh wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—adamantane's structure is such that the positions 1 and 3 are adjacent in a way that they can undergo elimination. Wait, no, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that upon elimination, it forms a bridge. Let me think.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck on the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with each carbon connected to three others. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on carbons that are two carbons apart in a linear chain? Or perhaps on adjacent bridge carbons. Oh wait, I think I should draw it mentally. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons arranged in a sort of chair-like structure. So 1 and 3 would be across from each other. But when KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but since they're not adjacent, maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So when KOH is added, it could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination and forming a double bond
