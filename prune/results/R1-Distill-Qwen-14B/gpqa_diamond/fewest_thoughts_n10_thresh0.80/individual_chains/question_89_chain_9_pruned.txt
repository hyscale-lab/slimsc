Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, and the 1,3-dibromo suggests two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons in that structure. When heated with KOH, it's probably an elimination reaction. Wait, but wait, KOH can also do substitution. But in this case, since it's dibromide, maybe double elimination? Oh right, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Hmm, maybe it's an oxide? Wait, no, if it's elimination, the product is an alkene.

Wait, but another possibility is that KOH in such a reaction might cause a ring-opening. Oh, wait adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe adding KOH would cause some kind of ring opening. But I'm not exactly sure about adamantane's structure. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, right? So perhaps dehydrohalogenation would form a bridge.

Wait, the product 1 is described as having an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe the initial reaction doesn't form an alkene but instead forms a ketone or an ester. Wait, but where would the carbonyl come from? Oh wait, if you have a dihalide and you eliminate two equivalents, but perhaps in a different way. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxide attacks one bromide, and then another, leading to an epoxide? No, but epoxide would have a different IR peak, more around 1250 or so for C-O.

Wait, maybe the dihalide undergoes two dehydrohalogenations to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base and forms a diepoxide? No, that doesn't make sense. Another possibility is that the vicinal dihalide reacts in a way that forms a ketone. Wait, but how? Vicinal dihalide can't directly form a ketone unless something else happens.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but forming a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a carbonyl. No, wait elimination would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the base isn't causing elimination but substitution. If KOH is in excess, maybe it's a SN2 reaction. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, so perhaps each Br is on adjacent carbons. In such a case, the base could substitute both, but how does that form a carbonyl? Alternatively,
