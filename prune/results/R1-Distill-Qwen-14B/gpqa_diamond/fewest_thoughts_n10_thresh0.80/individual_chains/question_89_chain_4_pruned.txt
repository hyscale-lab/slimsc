Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and NMR spectra. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. The 1,3-dibromo suggests there are Br atoms on two opposite faces of the adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. Oh, wait, that's probably an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it's likely an E2 mechanism. When dibromides react with strong bases, they usually lose two equivalents of HX (in this case, HBr) to form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so the elimination would form an exo double bond? Or an endo one? I'm not too sure about the specifics, but I think when you eliminate two Br atoms from adjacent carbons in a diamondoid, you get a double bond inside the structure. So the product after KOH would be a diene or maybe an annulene. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules upon dehydrohalogenation to form 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, adamantane has a structure that's quite rigid, so the product would likely be a bridged bicyclic diene.

Looking at the product 1's NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). And IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is a carbonyl stretch. Oh, but if product 1 is formed by elimination, why is there a carbonyl? Oh wait, maybe I was wrong. Because KOH can also cause some substitution if possible, but with two leaving groups, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. Maybe it's a ring-opening reaction? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, epoxidation usually requires something like peracid. Alternatively, thinking about the IR: 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group. So maybe product 1 is an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is reacting with KOH. Another possibility is that KOH could cause a nucleophilic substitution, but with two bromides, perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination than substitution. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: maybe it's a Hofmann elimination. But Hofmann typically involves amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But if that's the case, where would the alkene be?

Wait, could it be that the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, and the bromide leaves, forming an oxide ring or something. Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution, but with two adjacent Br atoms.

Wait, if two substituents (Br) are on adjacent carbons, when treated with a strong base like KOH, maybe it's a double elimination, leading to a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But then, what would the IR show? If it's a diene, maybe no carbonyl. But the IR here has 1720 cm-1, so that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the product is something else. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's around where an -OCH2O- group would appear, like in an epoxide. Or maybe it's an ether. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Alternatively, could product 1 be a diketone? But the NMR doesn't
