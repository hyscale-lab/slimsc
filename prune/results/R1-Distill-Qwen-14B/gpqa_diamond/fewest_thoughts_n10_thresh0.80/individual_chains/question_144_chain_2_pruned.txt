Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of this meson X. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime and speed. 

The question gives me the production energy (E_X = 8 GeV), mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), and width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). Wait, width relates to the lifetime, right? Oh yes, because the uncertainty principle says that Γ is related to the lifetime τ. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ).

But wait, I also need to find the speed of the meson. Since it's produced with a certain energy, I can calculate its velocity. The energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I can find v from this.

First, let's compute the Lorentz factor gamma. m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², and E is 8 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ≈ 6.6667. That's a high gamma, so the meson is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

To find v, I can use the relation gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me square gamma: gamma² = 1/(1 - (v²/c²)), so 1 - (v²/c²) = 1/gamma². Therefore, v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma² = (gamma² - 1)/gamma². Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute beta, which is v/c. So beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Let's plug in gamma ≈ 6.6667. So gamma squared is about 44.444. Then 1 - 1/44.444 is (44.444 -1)/44.444 ≈ 43.444/44.444 ≈ 0.9772. So beta ≈ sqrt(0.9772) ≈ 0.9885. So v is about 0.9885c. That's a pretty high speed.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to get v exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so the kinetic energy is E - m c² = 8 -1.2 =6.8 GeV. But wait, maybe I should just proceed with gamma as 6.6667.

Next, calculate the lifetime τ. The width Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. The relation between Γ and τ is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I remember that ħ ≈ 6.58
