Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same masses, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period means it's orbiting more quickly, right? Because closer planets orbit faster.

Oh wait, the host star of Planet_1 is more massive. The star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So same size, but different masses. More massive stars are usually larger, but in this case, their radii are the same. Hmm.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the size of the star, but also the size of the orbit. Oh wait, the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_star + a)), but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a (1 + a/R_s))) or something like that. Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, I think the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance relative to the star's size. The exact formula might be more precise, but I think it's something like P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a), but I'm not entirely sure. Or is it (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * sin i)), but since inclination is random, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a), because the maximum possible a for a transit is such that the planet's orbit must be aligned such that it passes in front, and the probability increases when the orbital distance is smaller.

Wait, alternatively, I think the probability of transit is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a), but I might be mixing up some factors. Oh wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ), because a is the semi-major axis, so a/R_s is a measure of how far the planet is from the star in terms of the star's radius. So a/R_s = d, where d is the distance in units of star radius. The transit probability is higher when d is small because the area where the planet can block the star (the cross-section) is larger relative to the star's disk.

Wait, I think the transit probability formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (d)), where d is the semi-major axis in units of the star's radius. Because a smaller d means the planet's orbit is closer, making it more likely to transit. Alternatively, it's (R_p^2 / R_s^2) multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), which simplifies to (R_p^2) / (a R_s). Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), which is (R_p^2 R_s) / (a R_s^2) ) → (R_p^2)/(a R_s). Hmm, not sure, but the key point is that the probability depends on the planet's size relative to the star and the planet's orbital distance relative to the star's size.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and different host star masses. However, the probability of transit depends on the size of the planet, the size of the star, and the orbital distance.

Wait, but the problem says the planets have the same mass. But wait, mass and radius are different things. Oh, but wait, we don
