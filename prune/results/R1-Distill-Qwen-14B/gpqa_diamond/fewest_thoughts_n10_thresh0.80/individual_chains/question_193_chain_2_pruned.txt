Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question, but I'm a bit confused. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, so if plx = 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, that's N ∝ (1/plx)^5. But since 1/plx is r, that would make N proportional to r^5. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. Because N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, so substituting that in, 1/( (1/r) )^5 is equal to (r^5). So N ∝ r^5. So that would mean that as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, I'm not sure if that means the derivative of N with respect to r. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4. But the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)." Oh, so they're asking about the change per unit distance, which would be the derivative dN/dr.

Wait, no. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The statement says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So for a given distance r, the number of stars increases with r^5. So if you're looking at a region at a larger r, the number of stars in that region scales as r^5. But wait, that doesn't sound right because usually, the number of stars in a volume depends
