Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about two reactions, and I need to choose the major products A and B from the given options.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as the base. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I need to figure out what products form in each case, considering steric hindrance and product stability.

Starting with the first reaction. It looks like a cyclohexanone derivative is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of a strong base. I remember that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester, it's likely an enolate alkylation or some kind of addition reaction. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, maybe it's a conjugate addition or a Michael addition? Or perhaps an aldol reaction?

Wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The structure would have a ketone group at position 1 (so, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 2 and 6). Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl), so the substituents are all around the ring.

Ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. When it reacts with a ketone under basic conditions, I think it's a nucleophilic attack. Oh wait, maybe it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation? Or perhaps a conjugate addition since acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

Another thought: when a ketone reacts with an enolate, you get enolate alkylation. Or wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. Since the base is t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. That suggests it's going to deprotonate something in a specific position.

In the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, a ketone and an aromatic aldehyde form a beta-keto ester. But I don't think that's directly applicable here.
