Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about mutant barley plants and their DNA sequences. Hmm, let's try to understand what's going on. The question says that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for making this compound, and it has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and when they sequenced the target gene, some changes happened in the first exon. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, so the wild-type gene is intact, and the mutants have changes. The anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene's product, so if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Looking at the sequences: Let's compare the wild-type and each mutant.

Wild-type starts with: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA

Wait, let me look for the differences. Comparing each nucleotide:

Wild: position 4 is T, mutant 1 has C. Let me see the exact positions.

Breaking it down:

Wild: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’

Wait, maybe it's easier to compare the beginning. Let's see the first part.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT

So, at position 4, wild has T, mutant1 has T? Wait, maybe I should index the positions. Let me write them out. Let's see:

Wild-type:

Positions 1-30 (hypothetically):

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

22-24: GTG

And so on.

Mutant1:

Positions 1-3: ATG same.

4-6: TCT (wild is TTT) so the second triplet is different.

Wait, actually, maybe the mutations are in the first exon, so they affect the coding sequence. So, any changes in the coding region can lead to amino acid changes.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: At the beginning, the first few bases are different. Let's look for the exact change.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, in the first few codons:

Wild: ATG (start, methionine), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

Mutant1: ATG (same), TCT (Ser), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

Wait, so the first two codons are different.
