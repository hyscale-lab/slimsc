Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with a pH and a volume.

Hmm. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, a base. When it reacts with an acid, it should undergo a neutralization reaction. Since it's a hydroxide, I think the reaction would produce water and the corresponding salt. But wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, right? Or does it behave more like a solid here? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the acid is monobasic and strong. So, it's like HCl, HNO3, or something similar. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule. So the acid is something like HA → H+ + A^-.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid would probably be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, each reacting with an H+ ion.

So first, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present in 0.1 grams.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1.008. So Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17.008 (16 O + 1.008 H). Since there are three OH groups, 3 * 17.008 = 51.024. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles. Let's approximate that as 9.357e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 9.357e-4 ≈ 0.002807 moles.

The strong acid is 0.1 M. So, volume needed (in liters) is moles / concentration. Moles is 0.002807, concentration is 0.1 mol/L.

Volume = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 liters → 28.07 cm³. Wait, so that's the minimum volume of acid needed. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is close to this value. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 0.1 g / (55.85 + 3*(17)) = 0.1 / (55.85 + 51) = 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.0009357. So yes, correct.

Then H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 moles.

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L → 28.07 cm³. So 28.05 is option C's volume.

But wait, the question says "the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid". So yes, we're calculating the exact amount required for neutralization. So the volume is about 28.07 cm³.

Now, what about the pH of the resulting solution? Hmm. After adding the acid, the solution would contain Fe^3+ ions and maybe some excess acid, depending on how much acid is added. But wait, the volume of the solution is 1
