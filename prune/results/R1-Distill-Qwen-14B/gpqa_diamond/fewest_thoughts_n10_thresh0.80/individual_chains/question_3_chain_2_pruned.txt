Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-half particle. Hmm, I remember that spin-half particles have spin states that can be either up or down, and these are eigenstates of the Pauli matrices. The question gives me a state vector in a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, wait. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The problem is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. 

I remember that expectation values can be broken down into the sum of the expectations for each operator multiplied by their coefficients. So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ equals 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I just need to find the expectation values of σz and σx for this state.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues are +1 for σz acting on |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So let me compute the inner product. 

⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Because when σz acts on |↑⟩, it gives +1 times |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩, it's -1 times |↓⟩.

Calculating that, |0.5|² is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. So 0.25 *1 + 0.75*(-1) equals 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. This is a bit trickier because σx doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. Instead, σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, I can compute ⟨σx⟩ by using the expectation value formula, which involves the state ψ.

The operator σx is represented by the Pauli matrix:
σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So, to compute ⟨σx⟩, I can write it as ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, since ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ (assuming |↑⟩ is the first element), the expectation value can be found as:

⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, how does σx act on the state? Let me think. Let's represent the state as a column vector. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] transpose.

Applying σx to ψ gives: σx * ψ = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] transpose. Then, taking the inner product of ψ with this gives (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (0.5*sqrt(3)/2)*2 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660...

Wait, but wait. Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to note that ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩) ? Or is there a different formula? Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it directly.

Wait, no, perhaps I should follow the proper procedure. Let's express |ψ⟩ as a vector:

|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Then, σx is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So, σx |ψ⟩ is [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

So, that would be 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is equal to 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So yes, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Now, putting it all together. The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is 10 * ⟨σz⟩ +5 * ⟨σx⟩.

We have ⟨σz⟩ as -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩ as approximately 0.866.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5.0, and 5*(0.866) = 4.33. Adding these together: -5.0 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, that's about -0.67. But wait, let me compute it exactly to be precise.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So yes.

So the total expectation value is -5 + (5 * sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, let's compute it exactly. Let me calculate 5*(sqrt(3)/2): 5*(1.732/2) =5*(0.866)=4.33.

So adding -5 +4.33 gives -0.67. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85
