Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is again.

The problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that must be the state vector, which I think is a 3x1 column matrix. The observable is represented by the matrix P. P has specific elements in each row. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0).

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. Hmm, right. In quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with that eigenvalue.

Wait, but wait—am I supposed to diagonalize P first to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors? Because P is the observable, so the eigenvalues would be the possible measurement outcomes. Then, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the inner product between the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues of matrix P. Let me write down matrix P properly.

P is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on finding eigenvalues. Let me recall. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix P - λ I would be:

[ -λ    1/sqrt(2)      0    ]
[1/sqrt(2)   -λ    1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0       1/sqrt(2)    -λ    ]

To find the determinant of this matrix. Let me compute it.

The determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
- 1/sqrt(2) * [ (1/sqrt(2))(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, actually, let me write it out properly. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

| a b c |
| d e f |
| g h i |

is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).

So applying that to P - λ I:

a = -λ, b=1/sqrt(2), c=0
d=1/sqrt(2), e=-λ, f=1/sqrt(2)
g=0, h=1/sqrt(2), i=-λ

So determinant:

(-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ]
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(0) ]
+ 0 * [ ... the third term which is zero, so we can ignore ]

Let me compute each part.

First part: (-λ) [ λ^2 - (1/2) ]

Second part: -(1/sqrt(2)) [ -λ/sqrt(2) - 0 ] = -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) )= -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) = (λ) / 2

Because 1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2) is 1/2.

So putting it together:

Determinant = (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) + (λ/2)

Let me expand that:

= (-λ^3 + (λ)(1/2)) ) + (λ/2)
= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2)
= -λ^3 + λ

So the equation is determinant = 0:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ(-λ^2 +1 )=0 → λ(1 - λ^2)=0

Wait, because -λ^3 + λ = λ( -λ^2 + 1 )=λ (1 - λ^2 )

So the eigenvalues are λ =0, and λ^2 =1 → λ=±1.

So the possible eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. So when we measure P, we can get 0, 1, or -1.

The question is, what is the probability of getting 0?

So, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, then calculate the inner product between the state vector and this eigenvector, then square its magnitude.

But wait, wait a second. The state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). Is this a normalized vector? Let me check its norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is not normalized. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So perhaps the given vector is not the actual state but just the components, and I need to normalize it?

Wait, the problem says, "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." So perhaps it's not normalized. So maybe I should normalize it first.

So the vector is ψ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, but does the problem require normalization? Because when calculating probabilities, the state vector must be normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities won't sum to 1. So I think I need to normalize ψ first.

So the actual state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector associated with λ=0.

Let's find the eigenvector for P with eigenvalue 0.

The equation is (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So, writing the matrix P:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Multiply by vector [x, y, z]^T.

Equation 1: 0*x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0*z = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) y = 0 → y=0.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) x + 0*y + (1/sqrt(2)) z = 0 → (x + z)/sqrt(2) =0 → x + z=0 → z = -x.

Equation 3: 0*x + (1/sqrt(2)) y + 0*z = 0 → same as equation 1, so y=0 again.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 satisfy y=0 and z = -x.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [x, 0, -x]^T. To make it a unit vector, we can set x = 1/sqrt(2), because then the vector is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T, whose norm is sqrt( (1/2) + 0 + (1/2) ) = sqrt(1) =1.

Wait, but wait: [x,0,-x], so the vector is [x, 0, -x]. Let's compute the norm squared: x^2 + 0 + x^2 = 2x^2. To make it 1, x^2=1/2 → x=1/sqrt(2) or -1/sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector can be [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T, or any scalar multiple, but for the inner product, the scalar factor won't matter because we take the inner product and then square the absolute value.

Alternatively, another possible scaling but I think this one is the normalized version.

So the eigenvector |v0> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Now, the state |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, the state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

We can write it as a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Now, we need to find the amplitude <v0|ψ>.

So, the inner product is the conjugate transpose of |v0> multiplied by |ψ>.

Since all the components are real, this is just the dot product.

So |v0> is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So adding them together:

(-1/(2 sqrt(3))) + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) ) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute square of this is ( (-1)/sqrt(3) )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the eigenvector. Because sometimes, the eigenvectors might not be unique. Maybe I should check for any calculation errors.

Wait, when solving for eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0, I got y = 0, and z = -x. So the eigenvectors are of the form [x, 0, -x]^T.

So the normalized eigenvector could also be, for example, [1, 0, -1]^T, but normalized.

Wait, [1,0,-1] has norm sqrt(2), so normalized it's [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T, which is what I used.

So the inner product indeed gives (-1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

Wait, let me recompute the inner product more carefully.

Each component:

First component: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third component: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/(sqrt(12))= (-1)/(2 sqrt(3)).

Adding them: (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) + (-1/(2 sqrt(3))) = (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the magnitude, which is (1/3).

So the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the eigenvalue \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The matrix \( P - \lambda I \) is:

\[
P - \lambda I = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is computed as:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left[ (-\lambda)(-\lambda) - \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \right] - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-\lambda) - 0 \right] + 0.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \left( \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \frac{\lambda}{2}.
\]

Expanding:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \frac{\lambda}{2} + \frac{\lambda}{2} = -\lambda^3 + \lambda.
\]

Setting \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \):

\[
-\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0 \implies \lambda(-\lambda^2 + 1) = 0 \implies \lambda = 0, \pm 1.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( P \) are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Substituting \( \lambda = 0 \) into \( P - \lambda I = P \), we solve \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Let \( |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} \). The equations are:

1. \( 0 \cdot x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y + 0 \cdot z = 0 \implies y = 0 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x + 0 \cdot y + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} z = 0 \implies x + z = 0 \implies z = -x \),
3. \( 0 \cdot x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y + 0 \cdot z = 0 \implies y = 0 \).

Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form \( |v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ 0 \\ -x \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing, we set \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), giving:

\[
|v_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector and Inner Product
The state vector is given as \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). To ensure normalization, we compute its norm:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product \( \langle v_0 | \psi \rangle \). Compute the inner product:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} (-1) + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} (1).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
|\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
