Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about pions and muons. Hmm, the question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a pion. Let me read it again.

The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, pi plus decays into a mu plus and a neutrino. Oh, right, and the pion is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, muon is 105.7 MeV. So I need to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, wait. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So their kinetic energies can be found based on their energies and masses.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energies of the muon and neutrino must add up to that.

But neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. Wait, I think for this problem, maybe we can consider the neutrino to be massless? Or perhaps the problem simplifies it that way. Because otherwise, it's hard to calculate without knowing the mass. Oh, the muon's rest mass is given, but what about the neutrino? Maybe it's assumed to be massless. Or perhaps the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. The products (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta. So their momenta p_mu and p_nu are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

But since the neutrino is massless, its energy E_nu is just |p_nu| * c. Similarly, the muon's energy E_mu is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, wait, units might get confusing. Let me think in terms of MeV.

Wait, the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV. So E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) / c^2. But since E is in MeV, and c is in units where c=1 typically in particle physics. Hmm, maybe I should work in natural units where c=1. So E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², but when c=1, it's 105.7 MeV. So E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2 )

The neutrino's energy E_nu is just p_nu, since it's massless. And since p_nu = -p_mu, E_nu = p_mu.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = E_mu + |p_mu|.

But the total energy must equal the pion's rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. So:

sqrt( p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p_mu = 139.6

Hmm, that looks like an equation I can solve for p_mu.

Let me set x = p_mu. Then the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt( x² + 105.7² ) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2

So:

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x

Compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6^2 = let's calculate that: 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So substituting into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * x

Let me rearrange:

2 * 139.6 * x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So:

2 * 139.6 * x = 8315.67

Which is 279.2 x = 8315.67

x = 8315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2. Hmm, 279.2 * 30 is about 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So maybe around 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = let's see. 279.2 * 30 is 8376, so 279.2 * 0.2 =
