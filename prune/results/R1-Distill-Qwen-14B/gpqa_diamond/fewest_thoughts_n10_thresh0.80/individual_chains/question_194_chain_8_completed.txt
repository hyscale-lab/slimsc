Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Let me think.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E). Beta is 1/(kT), right. So for each state, I calculate the energy and then compute exp(-beta * E), then sum all these for each possible configuration of S1, S2, S3.

Each spin has two states, so three spins would have 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to list all of them and calculate E for each. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without enumerating all possibilities.

Let me think about the energy expression. E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote each term as S_i S_j. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, since each S is ±1.

Wait, no. Wait, S_i S_j is the product of two spins. So if both are +1, product is +1. If one is +1 and the other -1, it's -1. If both are -1, product is +1 again. So S_i S_j is ±1.

So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. But the total is the sum of all three such terms. Let me think of all possible sums.

Wait, but for each triplet (S1, S2, S3), their products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 will each be ±1. So the sum inside E can be 3, 1, -1, or -3? Let's see.

Wait, for example, if all three spins are the same, say +1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum is 3. So E = -J * 3.

Another case: two spins +1, one -1. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no: E = -J*(sum), so if the sum is -1, E would be -J*(-1) = J.

Wait no, let me compute for S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1 S2 = 1*1=1.

S1 S3 =1*(-1)=-1.

S2 S3 =1*(-1)=-1.

Sum is 1-1-1= -1.

So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, the energy E is -J times the sum. So when the sum is -1, E is J.

Wait, but let me think about other cases.

Another case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

Compute S1S2= -1.

S1S3=+1.

S2S3= -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So again E= J.

Wait, another case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1 S2= -1.

S1 S3= -1.

S2 S3= 1.

Sum: -1 -1 +1= -1. E= J.

Wait, so when two spins are opposite, perhaps like two +1 and one -1, the sum is -1, leading to E= J.

Wait, what about another case: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Sum is 3. E= -3 J.

Another case: all spins -1. S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E= -3 J.

Another case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Wait, I think I did that before. Sum: -1 -1 +1= -1. E= J.

Wait, what about a triplet where all three spins are different from each other? Oh, but each spin is either +1 or -1. So if you have S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J again.

Wait, so how many states have sum=3, which gives E=-3J? Only two, I think. All +1 and all -1. So two states contribute to E=-3J.

Then the rest of the states (there are 6 others) have E= J or something else? Wait, let me count again.

Wait, for three spins, there are 8 possible states.

Number of states with sum=3: 2 (all +1 or all -1).

What about sum=1? Or sum= -1?

Wait, let's take another approach. Let me list all possible states and their energies.

1. (+1, +1, +1): sum = 3 → E = -3J.

2. (+1, +1, -1): sum = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J.

3. (+1, -1, +1): sum = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J.

4. (+1, -1, -1): sum = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1 → E= J.

5. (-1, +1, +1): sum = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1 → E= J.

6. (-1, +1, -1): sum = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J.

7. (-1, -1, +1): sum = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J.

8. (-1, -1, -1): sum = 3 → E= -3J.

Wait, so from the 8 states, 2 have E=-3J, and the other 6 have E=J.

So the partition function Z is the sum of exp(-beta E) for each state.

So for each state with E=-3J, the term is exp( beta *3 J ), since E is multiplied by -beta. So exp(3 J beta).

Each of the two such states contributes exp(3 J beta) each, so 2 exp(3 J beta).

For the other six states with E=J, each contributes exp(-beta * J) because E is J → exp(-J beta).

So six terms of exp(-J beta) → 6 exp(-J beta).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me check that again. The energy for those six states is J. So exp(-beta E) is exp(-beta * J).

Yes.

So Z = 2 exp(3 J beta) + 6 exp(- J beta).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because our first term is exp(3Jβ).

Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ) → Yes, this matches.

Option C: 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ) → Exponents are 2, so no.

Option D: 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ) → No.

So the correct answer is option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), we proceed as follows:

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). For three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state corresponds to a specific configuration of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). The energy \( E \) depends on the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), which can take values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \), depending on the spin configuration.

### Step 1: Enumerate states and calculate energies
1. **All spins \( +1 \):** \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \).  
   \( S_1S_2 = +1, S_1S_3 = +1, S_2S_3 = +1 \).  
   Sum: \( +1 + +1 + +1 = +3 \).  
   Energy: \( E = -J(+3) = -3J \).

2. **All spins \( -1 \):** \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \).  
   \( S_1S_2 = +1, S_1S_3 = +1, S_2S_3 = +1 \).  
   Sum: \( +1 + +1 + +1 = +3 \).  
   Energy: \( E = -J(+3) = -3J \).

3. **Two spins \( +1 \), one spin \( -1 \):**  
   - \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \):  
     \( S_1S_2 = +1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \).  
     Sum: \( +1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \).  
     Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).  
   - \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \):  
     \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = +1, S_2S_3 = -1 \).  
     Sum: \( -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \).  
     Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).  
   - \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \):  
     \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = +1 \).  
     Sum: \( -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \).  
     Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

4. **Two spins \( -1 \), one spin \( +1 \):**  
   - \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \):  
     \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = +1 \).  
     Sum: \( -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \).  
     Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).  
   - \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \):  
     \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = +1, S_2S_3 = -1 \).  
     Sum: \( -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \).  
     Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).  
   - \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \):  
     \( S_1S_2 = +1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \).  
     Sum: \( +1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \).  
     Energy: \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

### Step 2: Classify states by energy
From the above, there are:
- **2 states** with \( E = -3J \): All spins \( +1 \) or all spins \( -1 \).
- **6 states** with \( E = J \): All other configurations.

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum of \( e^{-\beta E} \) for all states:
\[
Z = 2e^{-\beta(-3J)} + 6e^{-\beta(J)}.
\]
Simplify the exponents:
\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed for the first term).
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (Correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (Incorrect, exponents are \( 2J\beta \)).
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (Incorrect, exponents are \( 2J\beta \)).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
