Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. We need to figure out which products are formed from the options given.

Hmm, so the starting material is an ether. The structure is an oxy group connected to a benzene ring. The other part is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Wait, let me draw that out. So, the substituent is a four-carbon chain. The first carbon is attached to the oxygen (since it's the 1-yl group). The second and third carbons have substituents. Wait, wait. Let's see: the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene? No, wait, but the double bond is at position 3. Oh wait, but-3-enyl: so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. So the double bond is between 3 and 4? Or wait, but that's but-1-ene, but the question says but-3-en-1-yl. Wait, but that can't be because but-3-ene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at the third position, but that's not possible since it's a four-carbon chain. Wait, maybe I should number it correctly.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be: positions
