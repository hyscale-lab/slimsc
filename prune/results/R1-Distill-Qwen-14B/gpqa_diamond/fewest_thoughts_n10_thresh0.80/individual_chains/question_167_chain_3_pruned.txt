Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is, right? Gaussian states are like coherent states or squeezed states, which have a certain kind of distribution in phase space, I think.

The state given is |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α> ] / N. Wait, φ is the phase, and α is the amplitude. And N is the normalization constant. Oh right, N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). So, for the given parameters, phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

The question is asking to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the non-Gaussian state's.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Relative entropy, also called Kullback-Leibler divergence, is a measure of how different one probability distribution is from a reference. But here, it's used to compare the state's density matrix with a Gaussian one. So the non-Gaussianity would be the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state.

But wait, the formula is the difference in the von Neumann entropy of the state and the reference. Because:
del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the entropy. Because trace(rho ln rho) is the entropy of rho, and similarly for tau.

Wait, but what is the reference Gaussian state? For a state like this, the reference is probably the best Gaussian approximation. Alternatively, maybe the reference is the coherent state with the same first moments? Or perhaps another Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy. Hmm, but I'm not sure exactly how to choose tau.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a state like the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the non-Gaussianity can be calculated by comparing it to the closest Gaussian state, which might be the thermal state or another Gaussian state. But I'm not entirely certain about the specifics here.

Wait, but let's think about the structure of the state. The state |ψ> is a superposition of |α> and |-α>. For phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) would be cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) is negative sqrt(2)/2. Wait, but sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes (sqrt(2)/2 |α> - sqrt(2)/2 |-α> ) / N.

Wait, but what is the normalization N? Let's plug in the given phi and alpha. Let's compute N first.

Given phi = -pi/4, so 2*phi = -pi/2.

sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

alpha = 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Hmm, but how does this relate to the density matrix and the relative entropy? I'm a bit stuck here. 

Wait, the relative entropy measure del_b is the entropy difference. So to compute this, I need to find rho, which is the density matrix of the given state, and tau, the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state. Then compute the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau.

But how do I find the reference Gaussian state? Wait, perhaps the reference is the closest Gaussian state to the given state. Because the relative entropy is minimized when tau is the closest Gaussian approximation to rho.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference is a coherent state, since coherent states are Gaussian. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reference could be the state with the same first moments as rho, but that might not be Gaussian.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the relative entropy between the state and the Gaussian state (tau) is zero only if the state is Gaussian. So if the state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero. But what's the case here?

The given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian. So nG should be positive. But wait,
