Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method. The problem gives some key data: their masses are the same, but their orbital periods are different, and their host stars have different masses but the same radii.

Hmm, I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh wait, the probability is proportional to R_planet^2 divided by R_star^2, right? Because it's the area the planet covers when passing in front of the star. But wait, isn't there also an angle factor? Oh right, the probability is actually (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned so that we see the transit. The alignment probability is roughly the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's orbital distance projected perpendicular to our line of sight. Wait, maybe it's more about the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, no, the transit probability (for a circular orbit) is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2))^(1/2)), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1. So the probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the probability of a transit also depends on the size of the star and the planet. But another factor is the orbital distance. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight. Oh, but the probability is actually given by the formula (R_p + R_s) / a, where a is the semi-major axis, multiplied by the geometric probability which is (R_p / R_s)^2. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability for a given system is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a (1 + (M_s/M_p)^0.5)) ) ), but that might be more for the Doppler method. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, I read that the probability that a planet transits is roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but scaled by the planet's size. Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the circle that the planet's orbit projects on the sky. But wait, I think the main factor is (R_p / R_s)^2 times the probability that the orbital plane is aligned, which is (R_s / a), because the planet's orbit must be within the 'cone' of our line of sight.

Wait, so the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), because the angle needs to be such that the planet's path passes in front of the star. So the formula combines the area and the alignment. So the probability P is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a) ) = R_p^2 / (R_s * a). Or wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the geometric probability. For a circular orbit, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) * (1 + something). Alternatively, the probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but considering the relative sizes.

Wait, another approach. The geometric probability P_geo is approximately (R_p / R_s)² * (R_s / a) * (something else). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)) ). I think I'm getting stuck here; perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, I think the geometric transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p + R_s) / (a * sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since both planets have circular orbits (e=0), it simplifies to P = (R_p + R_s) / (a).

Wait, but in reality, the probability is approximately the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, multiplied by the ratio of the planet's radius squared to the star's radius squared. Wait, maybe the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ) = (R_p²) / (R_s * a).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) ) = R_p² / (R_s * a). So that's the probability.

Wait, but the RV method gives the minimum mass of the planet. So perhaps the actual mass is known, but in this case, both planets have the same mass. But that doesn't directly affect the transit probability unless it affects the semi-major axis.

Wait, the semi-major axis a is determined by Kepler's third law. The RV method gives the minimum mass, but since the inclination isn't known, the actual mass could be higher. But in this problem, since we're comparing probabilities, perhaps the actual a is known? Or maybe it's based on their orbital periods.

Wait, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period P is proportional to a³/(M_s), where M_s is the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) * a³. But since M_p << M_s, we can approximate P² = (4π²/(G M_s)) a³.

So from the period, we can find a³ proportional to (P² M_s). But since both planets are around different stars, their a will depend on both the period and the star's mass.

Given that Planet_1 has an orbital period P1 = P2 / 3. The star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 * M2.

So let's denote:

P1 = P2 /3

M1 = 2 M2

We can relate a1 and a2.

From Kepler's third law:

P² ∝ a³ / M_s

So,

(P1)^2 / (P2)^2 = (a1^3 / M1) / (a2^3 / M2)

Substituting P1 = P2/3,

( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2^2) ) = (a1^3/(2 M2)) ) / (a2^3/(M2)) )

Simplify numerator on left: (P2²/9) / P2² = 1/9.

On the right side: (a1^3/(2 M2)) ) / (a2^3/(M2)) ) = (a1^3)/(2 M2) * (M2)/(a2^3) ) = (a1^3)/(2 a2^3)

Set equal:

1/9 = (a1/a2)^3 / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2/9 = (a1/a2)^3

Take cube roots:

(a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2.

Wait, so a1 is smaller than a2 because the period is shorter but the star is more massive. That makes sense because a shorter period would imply a smaller orbit, but a more massive star would also imply a smaller a for a given period.

Now, going back to the transit probability formula. If P ∝ (R_p^2) / (R_s * a), and for each planet, we have R_p same since they're Earth-like? Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass, but not necessarily same radius. Wait, the question states "Earth-like" but doesn't specify same radius. Hmm, but perhaps for this problem, we can assume R_p is the same for both planets, since they have the same mass and are Earth-like. Alternatively, maybe the radius is different, but the problem doesn't state that. Let me check the problem statement again.

The question says: "Both of these planets have the same masses." So same mass, but might not have same radius. Hmm, but Earth's mass and radius are related, but I'm not sure if we can assume R_p is same. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I have to proceed without that assumption. Wait, but since both are Earth-like, perhaps their radii are similar. Or maybe the problem expects us to ignore the planet radius difference because it's not given. Let's see.

Wait, the problem also says that the host stars have the same radii. So R_s1 = R_s2. Because the host stars have the same radii.

So R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s (say).

So, since R_p1 and R_p2 are Earth-like, perhaps it's safe to assume R_p1 = R_p2. But the problem doesn't state that. Alternatively, it's possible that the problem treats R_p as same for both.

Assuming R_p is same for both, then R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

So, the transit probability for each planet is:

P1 ~ (R_p^2) / (R_s * a1 )

P2 ~ (R_p^2) / (R_s * a2 )

So the ratio P2/P1 = ( (R_p²)/(R_s a2) ) / ( (R_p²)/(R_s a1) ) ) = a1/a2.

Wait, no, wait: the ratio of P2 to P1 is (a1/a2) because (1/a2) divided by (1/a1) is a1/a2.

Earlier, the cube root calculation gave a1/a2 ≈ 0.606. So P2/P1 = 0.606. So P2 is about 60.6% of P1. So P1 is higher.

Wait, but that can't be right because the transit probability is inversely proportional to a, so smaller a (closer planet) would have higher probability.

Wait, Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star. So a1 is smaller than a2. So P1 (transit probability) is higher than P2.

So, the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

But wait, let me think again. Because a is the semi-major axis. Since a1 is smaller, 1/a1 is larger, so P1 is larger. So yes, Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the options are C and D suggest Planet_1 is preferred. So the correct transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

Now, what's the exact ratio? Let's compute a1/a2.

We have earlier found (a1/a2) = (2/9)^(1/3).

Let me compute 2/9 ≈ 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So the ratio a1/a2 = 0.606.

So the transit probability P is proportional to 1/a, so P1 = (1 / a1) * (R_p^2 / R_s )

Similarly, P2 = (1/a2) * (R_p^2 / R_s )

So the ratio P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So the probability of a transit for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1 because it has a higher probability to transit.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher but our calculation is ~1.65.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula and the given data. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Since both planets are Earth-like, we assume \( R_p \) is the same for both. Additionally, the host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), so this term cancels out when comparing the two planets. Thus, the transit probability depends inversely on the orbital semi-major axis \( a \).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law, the relationship between the orbital period \( P \) and the semi-major axis \( a \) is given by:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_s}
\]

where \( M_s \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2, we know:
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period),
- \( M_{s1} = 2 \cdot M_{s2} \) (Planet_1's host star is more massive).

Substituting these into the proportionality:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / M_{s1}}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
\]

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3 / (2 \cdot M_{s2})}{a_2^3 / M_{s2}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{a_1^3}{2 \cdot a_2^3}
\]

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{2}{9} \cdot a_2^3
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbital distance is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 / a_2 \approx 0.606 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_2 is not 1.5 times higher.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The transit probability of Planet_1 is not 2.7 times higher.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller orbital distance, making it the preferred target for observation.
