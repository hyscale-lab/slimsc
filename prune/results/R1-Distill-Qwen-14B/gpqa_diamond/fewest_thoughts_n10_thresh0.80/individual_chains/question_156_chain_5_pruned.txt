Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says a chemist did two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each would show.

Wait, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. I remember that mCPBA is used in epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with an oxidizing agent like mCPBA to form an epoxide. So, both (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene would undergo epoxidation.

Wait, but the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product. For the epoxidation, the reaction typically proceeds via a cyclic transition state, which leads to the formation of an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are added with a specific stereochemistry. Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide with trans addition because the peracid attacks from the opposite side of the alkene's substituents.

But wait, when the alkene is (E) or (Z), how does that change the epoxide structure?

Let me think: the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene. Both are diastereomers. When each reacts with mCPBA, they form epoxides. Then, after aqueous acid, I think hydrolysis happens. Wait, epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening. Oh, right, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides.

Wait, wait, so let's clarify each reaction step by step.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide. Then, aqueous acid → ring-opening.

Same for Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → ring-opening.

So let's model this. First, the epoxidation. For each
