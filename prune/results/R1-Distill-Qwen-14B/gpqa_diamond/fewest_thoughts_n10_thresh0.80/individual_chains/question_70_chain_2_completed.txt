Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. 

So the question is about identifying the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. 

Hmm, the question gives a series of reactions, and I need to figure out what E is first, then determine its molecular symmetry. Let's break down the reactions one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember that when metals react with certain gases, like halogens, it can form compounds. For example, sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. But wait, 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe it's something like O2 or another diatomic gas. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like O2, but more likely, since it's 8 equivalents, perhaps B is a diatomic molecule that forms an ionic compound. Like, maybe B is Cl2. Wait, 8 equivalents might mean that each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B. Hmm, that's a high ratio. Maybe A is a transition metal, and B is a diatomic halogen. For example, if A is iron (Fe), and B is Cl2, but how many Cl per Fe? Iron(III) chloride is FeCl3, so 3 Cl per Fe. But 8 is a lot. Alternatively, maybe B is O2. Suppose A is sodium (Na), which reacts with O2 to form NaO2? Wait, sodium superoxide. Sodium superoxide is NaO2, and the formula is Na : O2 ratio is 1:1. But wait, sodium reacts with O2 to form sodium oxide. Sodium oxide is Na2O, and superoxide is NaO2. So, for sodium in +1 oxidation state, O is -1 in superoxide. 

Wait, but how does that tie into 8 equivalents? Maybe A is a transition metal that can form a high oxidation state. Alternatively, perhaps B is another diatomic molecule. Let me think of other possibilities. Oh wait, maybe B is hydrogen gas, H2. But that doesn't make much sense with 8 equivalents. Wait, another thought: maybe B is a diatomic molecule like F2. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. Let's say A is a metal, like copper. Copper reacting with fluorine in a high ratio. But copper usually forms CuF2, which is 1 Cu to 2 F. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something else. Another possibility is that A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2. For example, if A is lead (Pb), which reacts with O2 to form PbO2. Lead dioxide is bright red. Oh! Wait, that's possible. So Pb (lead) reacts with O2 to form PbO2, which is bright red. Let me recall: lead(IV) oxide is PbO2. So the reaction would be 2 Pb (solid) + O2 (gas) → 2 PbO2 (bright red). But wait, the stoichiometry here would be 2 Pb + O2 → 2 PbO2. So each Pb reacts with half an O2. So 1 equivalent of O2 per Pb. Wait, but the question says 8 equivalents of B. So if B is O2, and each Pb needs 1 O2, but in the reaction, 2 Pb need 1 O2. So for 2 Pb, 1 O2. So if 8 equivalents are used, that would mean 8 O2 molecules reacting with 16 Pb? But the question says solid A. So maybe A is Pb, and 8 O2 molecules for each Pb. Wait, but that doesn't fit the stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is Pb + 4 O2 → PbO2. Wait, no, the actual reaction is 2 Pb + O2 → 2 PbO2. So for each O2, 2 Pb. So 8 equivalents of O2 would mean 16 Pb. But in the problem, it's solid A, so perhaps A is Pb, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2, and A is a transition metal that forms a high chlorination. Another angle: the product C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Lead dioxide (PbO2) is a bright red solid. Also, maybe iron(III) oxide Fe2O3·nH2O is reddish, but perhaps not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's mercury(II,IV) oxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide with a high oxidation state, which is red. 

But let's move on to the next reaction to see if that helps. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form product E, which is extremely hazardous. What could that be? E is dangerous, so maybe it's something like phosgene (but that's from COCl2), or perhaps sarin gas, but I don't think so. Alternatively, if C is PbO2 and D is Cl2, then reacting PbO2 with Cl2 might form some chloroperoxide or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if D is H2, maybe some reaction occurs. Wait, another approach: when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it hydrolyzes into A, F, and G.

So let's think about hydrolysis. If C is a metal oxide, say PbO2, then reacting with water would form PbO2 + H2O → Pb(OH)2 + O something? Alternatively, maybe it's a dioxide that can form two different acids. Like, for example, if C is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a bright red gas. Wait, but in the first reaction, C is a product of A and B (solid and gas). If C is ClO2, perhaps A is a metal that can form ClO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, think about the hydrolysis of C. Let's say C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), which is a bright white solid, not red. So that might not fit. Alternatively, if C is PbO2, which is bright red. Then when it reacts with water, it could form Pb(OH)2, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, if C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, consider something like a sulfite or sulfate. Wait, let me think: if C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), which is a gas. But when it reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid, but wait, actually H2SO3 is a weak acid but more accurately, it's a moderately strong acid, but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: when C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio to make E. Let's think about possible reactions. Suppose C is PbO2. D could be Cl2. Then, PbO2 + Cl2 → ? Maybe PbCl2 and OCl2? Not sure. Alternatively, if D is H2, then perhaps C is something that reacts with H2. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, let's think about the products when C reacts with water. The products are A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C must be a compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For instance, if C is a diacidic anhydride. For example, consider the case where C is an anhydride of a strong and a weak acid. Wait, like if C is a mixed anhydride. Hmm, another example: if C is sodium carbonate (but that's a carbonate, which would hydrolyze into HCO3^- and OH^-). Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, which would hydrolyze into H2SO3 (a weak acid) and something else. Wait, but we need two different acids. 

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide). When SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4, a strong acid. But wait, that's only one acid. So maybe C is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride or something else.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So B and D react 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Possible solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But H is a product of B and D. So if B is, say, O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O, a solvent. So that fits! So B is O2 and D is H2. Then their reaction would be O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. Wait, but the ratio is 1:1, so D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So if B is O2 and D is H2, but their stoichiometry is 1 O2 : 2 H2. So that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio for B:D. So if B is Cl2 and D is H2, their reaction produces HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: if B is F2 and D is H2, then F2 + H2 → 2 HF. That's a 1:1 ratio. HF is a solvent? Well, it's a liquid under certain conditions. But HF is a weak acid and not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is something else. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is C (carbon), but that's not a gas. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4. But then, reaction is O2 + CH4 → CO2 + H2O, but that's combustion and requires specific conditions. Not likely to form a solvent in a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is another gas that can form a solvent. Another possibility: D is NH3 (ammonia), which is a gas. But then B would have to be something that reacts with NH3 in a 1:1 ratio. For example, Cl2 and NH3 can react to form NH2Cl or something, but that's a gas and not a solvent. Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Then, Cl2 + CH4 → CCl4, which is a solvent. But that's a 1:1 ratio. So B:Cl2, D:CH4, H:CCl4. That would fit the 1:1 ratio. But would that align with earlier reactions? Let's see. 

If B is Cl2, and in the first reaction, A reacts with Cl2 to form C. If A is CH4 (but that's a gas, but the question says A is a solid). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2, D is CH4. So H is CCl4. Let's see if that fits.

Now, back to the first reaction. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2 to form C. What's a solid that reacts with Cl2 in an 8:1 ratio? Well, perhaps a metal that forms a high chlorination. For example, maybe A is a transition metal like Fe, which can form FeCl4 (but Fe usually forms FeCl2 and FeCl3). Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with a +2 oxidation state, but 8 Cl per A? That's a lot. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is PbO (lead(II) oxide) reacting with Cl2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry there. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal in a higher oxidation state. Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. For example, sulfur reacting with Cl2. But sulfur is a solid, and when it reacts with Cl2, it forms SCl2, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps A is silicon, but that's a stretch.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to find a different approach. Let's see what E is. Since E is produced by C reacting with 2 equivalents of D. Earlier, I thought that D could be CH4 if B is Cl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is another diatomic gas. Let's make a table:

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- Reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent), 1:1 ratio

From Reaction 4, B and D react 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Let's think of possible B and D gases that combine 1:1 to form a solvent. 

If H is H2O, then B and D would be O2 and H2. The reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. That's a 2:1 ratio. Doesn't fit. But maybe if B is O2 and D is H2, but the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. 

Another solvent is NH3. But if H is NH3, then B and D would have to react to form it. For example, B could be H2 and D could be N2. But N2 and H2 react in the presence of a catalyst to form NH3, but the ratio is 3 H2 : 1 N2 → 2 NH3. So that's a 3:1 ratio, which again doesn't fit 1:1. 

Another solvent is CCl4. So if H is CCl4, then B could be Cl2 and D could be CH4. The reaction would be CH4 + 2 Cl2 → CCl4 + 2 HCl. But that's a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, if B is Cl2 and D is CH4, perhaps another reaction. CH4 + Cl2 → under certain conditions, maybe CH2Cl2 or something else? But I think the main reaction is CH4 + 2 Cl2 → CCl4 + 2 HCl. So ratio is 1:2, not 1:1. So that's not helpful.

Another solvent is ether, like diethyl ether. But that's formed from ethanol and sulfuric acid, not from gases reacting.

Wait, perhaps H is NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide), but that's not a gas reaction. Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH3OH (methanol), but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe H is CO2? No, that's a gas. So perhaps H is something else. Let me think of another approach.

Let me think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. For example, if C is an anhydride of HCl (strong) and H2S (weak), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, think of a sulfite, which would hydrolyze to H2SO3 (weak) and something else. Wait, if C is a mixed anhydride of HCl and H2SO3, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate anhydride. No, because that would give only H2SO4 upon hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal oxide, perhaps a peroxide. For example, if C is PbO2 (lead dioxide), which is bright red. Then, when PbO2 reacts with water, it can decompose. But I'm not sure of the products. Alternatively, perhaps it reacts to form PbO, which is yellow, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis produces a strong and a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, if C is SO3, the anhydride of H2SO4. When SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4, a strong acid. But that's only one acid. So that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: C could be a nitride, like AlN. When AlN reacts with water, it produces NH3 (a weak base, not acid) and Al(OH)3. So that's not acid production.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. But sulfides usually hydrolyze to produce H2S (a weak acid, but more of a gas). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into NaOH (a strong base) and H2CO3 (a weak acid). But that's a base and an acid, but the problem says two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought. If C is a sulfate, like Na2SO4. Then, hydrolysis would not produce acids, but perhaps if it's a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (base). But again, only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chlorate. For example, KClO3. When it reacts with water, it would stay as is, since it's a strong acid's salt. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, consider that C is a diacidic anhydride. Wait, perhaps C is a compound like (HClO)2, which upon hydrolysis would produce HClO (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid). But I'm not sure if such a compound exists.

Wait, another approach. Let's suppose that C is SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a bright yellow liquid. But I'm not sure about that. When SO2Cl2 reacts with water, it forms HCl and H2SO4. Wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is also a strong acid. So that doesn't fit because we need two different acids, one strong and one weak.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound. Let's think about the reaction C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous substances? sarin gas, phosgene, mustard gas, etc. Let's say E is phosgene (COCl2). How would that form?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a base, but that's not involving D. Alternatively, maybe from Cl2 and CO. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is chlorine gas, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: if C is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a bright red gas. Then, reacting with D to form E. But I'm not sure what D would be in that case. Alternatively, if C is ClO2 and D is Cl2, then maybe E is something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: since E is produced by C reacting with D in a 2:1 ratio, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. For example, if C is ClO2 and D is Cl2, maybe E is OCl2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- A is a solid.
- B is a gas, possibly O2, Cl2, or another diatomic.
- C is bright red, possibly PbO2 or another oxide.
- D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent H.
- When C reacts with water, it gives back A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).
- E is extremely hazardous, formed from C and 2 D.

Let's try to hypothesize possible identities.

If C is PbO2, then when it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't hydrolyze much, but maybe under strong conditions, it could form Pb(OH)2, which is a strong base. But that would produce a base, not acids. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. Let's say C is Na2SO3. Then, hydrolysis would produce NaOH (strong base) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But the problem says F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if C is a mixed anhydride, like HSO3·H2SO4. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate. For example, NaClO3. Hydrolysis would give HClO3 (strong acid) and NaOH (base). Again, not matching.

Wait, another approach: F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C must be an anhydride of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, H2SO4 (strong) and H2CO3 (weak). So maybe C is (H2SO4)(H2CO3), but I'm not sure of the structure. Alternatively, C could be an anhydride of HCl and H2S, but that's not common.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is (HClO)·(H2SO4), but I don't think such a compound exists.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonoyl chloride, which would hydrolyze to give a strong acid (like H2SO4) and a weak acid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about Reaction 4 again. B and D react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is a solvent like ethanol, then B and D must be gases that can form ethanol. But the only way is if B is H2 and D is CO, then in the presence of catalysts, they can form ethanol. But the ratio would be more than 1:1 (e.g., 2 H2 + CO → CH3OH, which is 2:1 ratio). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if H is methanol, then B would have to be CO and D H2, but again, the ratio is not 1:1. 

Hmm, maybe H is something else. What about acetone? But I don't think it can be formed from gases in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, another idea: perhaps H is H2O, but then B and D would have to be O2 and H2 in a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit because their reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, a 2:1 ratio. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, H could be NH3, but then B and D would have to be N2 and H2 in a 3:1 ratio, which again doesn't fit.

This is getting a bit frustrating. Let me try to think of possible E. If E is phosgene (COCl2), then it's produced from CO and Cl2. But how would that fit into the other reactions?

Wait, if E is phosgene, then reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. So if E is COCl2, then D would be Cl2, and C would be CO. But where does CO come from? Let's see: reaction 1, A + 8 B → C (CO). So A would be a solid that reacts with 8 equivalents of B (maybe O2) to form CO. But that seems unlikely because forming CO typically requires specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is sarin gas, which is (OP(O)(CH2CH2O)3). But I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, maybe E is Cl2O7 (chlorine pentaoxide). But I'm not sure how that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which is a hazardous gas. But how would that form from C and D?

This is getting too vague. Let me try to think about the possible options for E and see what their symmetry groups are.

The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

D4h is a high symmetry group, common in molecules like methane (but wait, methane is Td symmetry). Wait, no, D4h is the symmetry of a square planar molecule with a mirror plane. Alternatively, D4h is the symmetry of molecules like ICl2 (dichlorine monoxide?) or other planar molecules with certain substituents.

Wait, D∞h has an infinite sequence of mirror planes and a two-fold rotation axis. That's the symmetry of a linear molecule with two identical ends, like CO2 or HCN. So if E is a linear molecule with high symmetry, D∞h would be the group.

Alternatively, C2v is a point group with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. Molecules like H2O (which is C2v symmetry) fall into this group.

C2 is a simple twofold rotation axis, like in a molecule like ethylene (but I'm not sure).

So, to determine the symmetry group of E, I need to figure out what E is.

Wait, another angle: considering that E is extremely hazardous. Common hazardous gas with high symmetry could be phosgene (COCl2), which is planar and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, COCl2 has a trigonal planar structure, which is D3h symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, Cl2O is dichlorine monoxide; its structure is bent, with a bond angle around 119 degrees, so it's probably C2v symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: if E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with a bond angle around 117 degrees. Ozone has C2v symmetry. So if E is O3, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

Let me see: If E is O3, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → O3. So D would be O2? Because O3 can be formed from O2 via some reaction, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, O3 is formed via the reaction of O2 with some other gas, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O, dichlorine monoxide. Cl2O has the structure OCl2, which is bent, so its symmetry is C2v.

But then, reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → Cl2O. So D would be something that reacts with C to form Cl2O. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is something else. Let's think of another extremely hazardous gas: hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is highly toxic. HCN is a linear molecule, so it would have D∞h symmetry. So if E is HCN, then its symmetry group would be D∞h (option C). But how would that fit the reactions?

So, E as HCN: reaction 2 is C + 2 D → HCN. So D would be a gas that reacts with C to form HCN. Let's think about how HCN is formed. It's typically produced by the reaction of cyanide salts with acids, but that's not involving gases. Alternatively, HCN can be formed from the reaction of CH4 and Cl under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has trigonal planar geometry, so its symmetry group is D3h. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options don't include D3h, so perhaps another candidate.

Wait, another thought: if E is diphosgene (Cl2C=O)Cl2, but that's solid, not a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2, which is a gas. SO2 has a bent structure, so symmetry group C2v. That would fit option D. If E is SO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → SO2. So D could be O2, but how would that fit?

Wait, reaction 4: B + D → H (solvent). If E is SO2, and D is O2, then reaction 4 would have B and O2 reacting to form a solvent. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, if D is something else.

Alternatively, maybe E is NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. So if E is NO2, its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

So, putting it all together:

If E is NO2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → NO2. So what is D? Let's see. If C is PbO2 (bright red), and D is O2, then reaction 2 would be PbO2 + 2 O2 → NO2? That doesn't make sense because PbO2 reacting with O2 might not form NO2. Alternatively, maybe D is another gas, like Cl2.

Wait, perhaps C is something else. Let me think again.

If C is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), which is a bright white solid. No, the product C is bright red, so that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: C is Mn2O7 (manganese heptoxide), which is bright red. Mn2O7 is a strong oxidizing agent. When it reacts with water, it decomposes into HMnO4 (strong acid) and MnO2. Wait, but MnO2 is a solid, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it forms permanganic acid and something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide like CoO, which is a red solid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), which is a gas. It's colorless, though, not red. So that doesn't fit.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think of the products. If E has symmetry group D∞h, it must be a linear molecule. So possible E could be HCN (linear, D∞h), phosgene (trigonal planar, D3h), or something like ClF3 (trigonal pyramidal, C3v). Alternatively, O2 has D∞h symmetry, but O2 is diatomic, so that's also possible. But O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, if E is O2, but O2 is not extremely hazardous in normal concentrations. Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry.

So, if E is O3, the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

So, let's piece it together: E is O3. Then reaction 2: C + 2 D → O3. So D must be O2. Because O3 can be formed from O2 under certain conditions. But O3 is formed from O2 via photochemical reactions, but the stoichiometry is O2 → O3. Wait, but reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. So if E is O3, D would need to be O2, and C would be some catalyst? That doesn't make sense because C is a product from the first reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O (dichlorine monoxide), which is a bright red gas, but I'm not sure. Cl2O has a structure similar to O3, bent, so C2v symmetry. So if E is Cl2O, then its symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But how does that fit the reactions?

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → Cl2O.

Assuming D is O2 and C is ClO2. Wait, no, ClO2 is a bright red gas. If C is ClO2, then reaction 2: ClO2 + 2 D → Cl2O. But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O3, but that's speculative.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that E is phosgene (COCl2), which has a trigonal planar structure, so D3h symmetry. But that's not an option, so perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe E is ClF3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure with C3v symmetry. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, looking back at the options, D4h is a possibility. D4h symmetry is common in molecules like CH4 (but CH4 is Td), or maybe in some other planar structures. Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like SO4^2- but that's an ion, not a molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2, which has D∞h symmetry. So option C is D∞h.

But O2 isn't extremely hazardous in normal concentrations. However, if E is O3, it's a toxic gas with C2v symmetry.

Hmm. Based on the options, the most likely symmetry groups that fit hazardous gases are C2v (O3) and D∞h (like O2 or HCN).

If E is O3, then the answer is C2v (option D). If E is HCN, the symmetry is D∞h (option C).

But how to decide between them? Let's look at the other reactions.

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → HCN. So D would have to be something that reacts with C to form HCN. For example, if C is CH3Cl and D is H2O, but that's not a gas. Alternatively, if C is CO and D is H2, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (COCl2), then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → COCl2. So C would be something that reacts with D (maybe Cl2) to form COCl2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at reaction 3. C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C must be a compound that can hydrolyze into two acids. One possibility is that C is a mixed anhydride, like (HCl)·(H2SO4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if C is SOCl2, which upon hydrolysis gives HCl (strong acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). But that's two strong acids, not one weak and one strong.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfonamide or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NaHSO4. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into H+ (from HSO4^-) and Na+ and SO4^2- (which can hydrolyze to produce HSO4^- again). But that doesn't give two different acids.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfate ester. For example, if C is (RO)SO3 (like methyl sulfate). When it hydrolyzes, it produces H2SO4 (strong acid) and ROH (alcohol, which is a weak acid? No, alcohols are weak bases, but maybe if it's a phenol, which is a weak acid). So, if C is methyl sulfate, hydrolysis gives H2SO4 and methanol. But methanol is not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is an acid anhydride of HCl and something else. For example, if C is HClO4·H2SO4, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloro-sulfuric acid, like ClSO3H. When it hydrolyzes, it might produce HCl (strong) and H2SO4 (strong), but again, both are strong acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite ester. For example, if C is methyl sulfate, but that's more of a sulfate ester. Alternatively, if C is something like CH3SO3H (methanesulfonic acid), but that's a strong acid itself.

Hmm, this is really challenging. Let me try to think of what E could be based on the options. If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule. So HCN is a possibility. Phosgene is trigonal planar, which isn't in the options. O2 is diatomic, D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, but O2 isn't extremely hazardous. Alternatively, ClF3 has C3v symmetry, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a noble gas, but that's not relevant.

Wait, another possibility: E is a diatomic molecule like I2 (iodine), but that's a solid under standard conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a gas like NH3, but that's not extremely hazardous in low concentrations.

Alternatively, consider that E is H2O, but that's a solvent and not extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like H2S, which is a weak acid. But H2S has a bent structure, so C2v symmetry. Let's see, if E is H2S, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → H2S. So D would be a gas that reacts with C to form H2S. For example, if D is H2 and C is S, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A (a solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). If C is S (solid), then S + H2O → H2S (weak acid) and something else. But that doesn't fit because S isn't reacting completely with water to form just H2S. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, but I'm not certain.

This is taking too long. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options. Since the question states that E is extremely hazardous, and considering the options for symmetry groups, the likely candidates are O3 (C2v) or HCN (D∞h). Based on the reactions, if E is O3, then the symmetry group is C2v (option D). If E is HCN, it's D∞h (option C).

But considering that E is produced from C and D in a 2:1 ratio, and the other reactions, I'm going to go with E being O3, which has C2v symmetry. So the answer would be D) C2v.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like PbO₂ (lead(IV) oxide) or Mn₂O₇ (manganese heptoxide). However, the exact identity of A, B, and C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. E is highly toxic, suggesting it could be a gas like phosgene (COCl₂), ozone (O₃), or hydrogen cyanide (HCN). These compounds have distinct molecular symmetries:
   - Phosgene (COCl₂) has trigonal planar geometry (D₃h symmetry, not listed in the options).
   - Ozone (O₃) has bent geometry (C₂v symmetry).
   - Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) has linear geometry (D∞h symmetry).

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely an anhydride or a compound that hydrolyzes into acids. For example, if C is SO₃ (sulfur trioxide), it would hydrolyze to form H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and H₂SO₃ (weak acid). However, SO₃ is not bright red, so this is speculative.

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Possible solvents include water (H₂O), methanol (CH₃OH), or ethanol (C₂H₅OH). This reaction provides limited clues about the identity of B and D.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:
   - **C₂**: A simple twofold rotation axis, unlikely for a highly symmetric molecule like E.
   - **D₄h**: High symmetry group for square planar or other symmetric molecules, which does not match the likely candidates for E.
   - **D∞h**: Symmetry of linear molecules like HCN. If E were HCN, this would fit, but there is no clear evidence from the reactions supporting this.
   - **C₂v**: Symmetry of bent molecules like O₃. If E is ozone, this would fit, and O₃ is consistent with being extremely hazardous.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the options provided, the most plausible candidate for E is ozone (O₃), which has C₂v symmetry. This aligns with the description of E as extremely hazardous and the molecular geometry implied by the symmetry group.
