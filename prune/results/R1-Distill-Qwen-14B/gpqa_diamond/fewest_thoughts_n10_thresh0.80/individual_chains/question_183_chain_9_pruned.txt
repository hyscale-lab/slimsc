Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency in the product obtained from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options given are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated based on the formula Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But in this case, since the product is after reaction with HI, I need to determine its structure first.

So, the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw that structure mentally. It's a cyclohexene ring, so six-membered ring with a double bond. The numbering: position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), position 3 is a double bond (so between C2 and C3?), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH-). Wait, no, wait. The structure should be cyclohexene, so positions 3 and 4 have a double bond maybe. Wait, no, the name is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So the cyclohex-3-ene ring. At C2, there's a formyl (CHO) substituent. At C5, a vinyl group, which is CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. So the substituent is CH₂CH₂? Or CH₂CH₂ attached where? Hmm, maybe it's CH₂CH₂ attached to the ring. Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so the substituent is CH₂CH₂? No, wait, no. The substituent is a vinyl group, which is -CH₂CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is -CH₂CH₂ but with a double bond. Wait, no: vinyl is actually CH₂=CH–. So
