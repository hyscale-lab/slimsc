Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where ε is an energy constant, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Oh wait, σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and they're used in quantum mechanics for spin-½ particles.

So, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each of them has eigenvalues ±1. Because when you look at σx, σy, σz individually, their eigenvalues are 1 and -1. But wait, in this Hamiltonian, H is a dot product of σ and n, multiplied by ε.

Wait, the dot product σ · n would be σx n_x + σy n_y + σz n_z. So H is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices with coefficients n_x, n_y, n_z, each scaled by ε.

Now, I'm trying to recall the properties of such a Hamiltonian. I think that the eigenvalues of any matrix of the form a·σ (where a is a vector) are ±|a|. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and when you take a linear combination, the magnitude would determine the eigenvalues.

Wait, in this case, the "a" vector is ε times the unit vector n. Because H = ε (n · σ). So the magnitude of "a" would be ε, since n is a unit vector. So the eigenvalues should be ±ε.

Wait, no, wait. Hmm, perhaps I should think more carefully. Let me represent the Hamiltonian as a matrix. Let's see, σ · n is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with n, which is (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz). So the matrix would look like:

H = ε [n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz]

Each σ matrix is 2x2. So the Hamiltonian would be a 2x2 matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I can calculate the trace and determinant, or use the property that for any matrix of the form a·σ, the eigenvalues are ±|a|.

Wait, but what's |a
