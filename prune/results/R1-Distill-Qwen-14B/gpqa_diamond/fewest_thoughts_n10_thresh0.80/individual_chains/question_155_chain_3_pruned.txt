Okay, so I've been given this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure out the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, the setup: The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ]^T. And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the basis here is probably the standard z-basis, meaning the state is already expressed in terms of P_z eigenstates.

Wait, but to find the uncertainty in P_z, I remember that the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

First, let me write down the state vector. The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ]^T. Wait, but are these the components in the P_z basis? Yes, because the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component corresponds to a different eigenvalue of P_z.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of P_z? Looking at the matrix for P_z, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the state vector ψ is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, which means each component corresponds to one of these eigenvalues.

So, the state ψ has three components: the first is -1/2, second is 1/√2, third is -1/2. But wait, each component is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate. So the eigenstates are |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I think it's the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by their eigenvalues. Because in the eigenstate basis, the expectation value is just the weighted average.

So, the first term is | -1/2 |² multiplied by ħ. That's (1/4) * ħ. The second term is |1/√2 |² multiplied
