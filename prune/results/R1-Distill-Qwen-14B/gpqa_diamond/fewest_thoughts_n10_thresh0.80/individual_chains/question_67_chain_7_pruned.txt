Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about orbital angular momentum states of two electrons. Let me read it again.

So, two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably means we don't have to worry about the spin part of the wavefunction. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, right.

Wait, okay, each electron's orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are l1 and l2. For p orbitals, l is 1, so both l1 and l2 are 1 here. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. So the state is a combination of these.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. Remember, Lz is the component of angular momentum along the z-axis. For each electron, L_z can have eigenvalues of -lħ, - (l-1)ħ, ..., up to lħ. Since each has l=1, their possible m values (or ml for each) are -1, 0, +1. So each L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But wait, when we talk about the coupled state, which is a combination of individual states. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled state, so it's a combination of different product states of each electron's individual states.

I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states of each electron's individual states. Because when we measure L1z and L2z, we're essentially looking at these individual states to find the probability.

So, the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is a linear combination of |l1, m1> tensor |l2, m2>, such that m1 + m2 = m. In this case, m is -1. So m1 +
