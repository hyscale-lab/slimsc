Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes to form another 1,5-diene. But wait, the starting material here is a bicyclic compound. Let me think about that.

The compound is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like norbornane, right? So the structure has a bridge. The numbering is a bit tricky. Let me try to visualize it. The molecule has a bridge between carbons 1 and 4, with a seven-membered bicyclic system. Wait, noâ€” the bicyclo[2.2.1] indicates that there are two bridges, each of two carbons and one carbon respectively. So the structure is a norbornene derivative since there's a double bond.

The substituents are at position 2. There's a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but actually CH2CH-) attached to the nitrogen at position 2. Wait, wait, the formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo... So the nitrogen is at position 2, and it's substituted with a vinyl group.

So the molecule is a bicyclic diene with the nitrogen in the ring. The Cope rearrangement typically involves a 1,5-diene. So I need to see
