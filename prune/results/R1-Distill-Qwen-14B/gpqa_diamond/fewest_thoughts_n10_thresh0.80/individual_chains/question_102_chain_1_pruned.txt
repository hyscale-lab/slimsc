Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're looking into their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments, and the result is that there's no green signal observed under the confocal microscope. I need to figure out why that's happening.

First, I'll try to understand the components of the question. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. So, the structure suggests that the receptor is probably a GPCR (though not entirely sure, but maybe that's not directly relevant here).

They used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs in the same transcript, right? So the vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream of its ORF, which allows for internal ribosome entry site, meaning the two proteins can be expressed as separate ORFs in the same mRNA.

The stops are in loxP and lox2272 cassettes. LoxP is a recombination site used by Cre. So between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent the downstream ORF from being expressed. When Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop and allowing expression.

So when they use the Cre vector, the mCherry and eGFP should be expressed based on their location. Wait, but the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is 5' to the ligand ORF. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed because the promoter is active, but the stop before mCherry would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor would be under IRES, which might mean it's expressed after the ligand? Or is it a separate thing?

Wait, no. In a bicistronic construct, the two ORFs are on the same transcript. The first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, and then the IRES allows for the receptor ORF to be translated. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry (since the ligand is fused to mCherry), but the stop cassette before mCherry would prevent that. Wait, no, the stop is between ligand and mCherry. So the ligand is under CBA, then after the ligand ORF is a stop with loxP, then mCherry. Without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES allows the ribosome to continue and translate the receptor ORF. But the stop before eGFP (lox2272) means that eGFP is only expressed when that stop is removed.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the vector is ligand (with CBA promoter) - loxP-stop-loxP - mCherry, and then IRES - receptor - lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP. So, without Cre, the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry fusion? Or is the mCherry separate? Or perhaps the ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry. Maybe the ligand is under the promoter, then after the ligand, the
