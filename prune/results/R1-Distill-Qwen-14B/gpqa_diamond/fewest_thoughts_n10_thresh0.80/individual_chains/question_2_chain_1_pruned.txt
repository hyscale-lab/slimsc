Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a benzene ring attached to a propenal group. Trans-cinnamaldehyde specifically has the double bond in the trans configuration. So its structure is something like benzaldehyde with a CH2 group attached, but wait, no, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH2-CHO? No, no, wait. No, cinnamaldehyde is actually C6H5-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing it with something else. Let me think. Oh right, cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, no, the structure is actually (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is a benzene ring connected to a CH2 group, but wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. The aldehyde is at the end. So it's benzene connected to a CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no, that's not right. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a CH2CH2 group, but that can't be. Oh wait, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic compound with an alpha,beta-uns
