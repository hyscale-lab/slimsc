Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. The potential is given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²(θ). Hmm, I need to figure out which of the options A to D is correct.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a particle depend on the potential it's in. The most familiar potentials are the harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb potential, but here it's a two-dimensional problem, so maybe it's a combination or a specific form of a harmonic oscillator.

Looking at the potential V(r, θ), it's written in polar coordinates because it's a function of r and θ. The potential has two terms: (1/2)k r² is familiar as the potential for a simple harmonic oscillator in one dimension. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²(θ). That looks a bit more complicated. I wonder if this can be rewritten in a way that makes it easier to analyze.

Wait, cos²(θ) can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Remember that cos²(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that into the potential, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos(2θ)) / 2 ] which simplifies to (3/4)k r² (1 + cos(2θ)). So the overall potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ).

Let me compute those constants. The first term is (1/2)k r², and the second is (3/4)k r². Adding those together gives (1/2 + 3/4)k r² = (5/4)k r². So the potential simplifies to V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ).

Wait, maybe I should factor out (k r²/4) from the terms. Let's see: (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos(2θ)) = (k r²/4)(5 + 3 cos(2θ)). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, perhaps this potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Since r² = x² + y² and cos(2θ) can be written as (x² - y²)/(x² + y²). Let me see:

So cos(2θ) = (x^2 - y^2)/(x^2 + y^2). Substituting that into the potential, V(r,θ) becomes (5/4)k(x² + y²) + (3/4)k(x² + y²)*[(x² - y²)/(x² + y²)].

Wait, the (x² + y²) term cancels in the second part. So that's
