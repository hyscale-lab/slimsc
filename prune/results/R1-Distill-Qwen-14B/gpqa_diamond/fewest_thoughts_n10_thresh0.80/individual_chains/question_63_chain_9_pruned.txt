Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

The given data:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (w) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D with various values of momentum p.

Wait, so I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. The quantum rotation-vibration model... Oh right, diatomic molecules can vibrate and rotate, and their energy states are quantized. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, probably the v=0 state for vibration and the J=0 state for rotation.

When the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next lowest energy state. But wait, what does that mean? The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Since the question is about the lowest possible energy transition, I think it's referring to the smallest energy difference between states.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the moment of inertia isn't constant either. Hmm, but maybe for this problem, it's treated as a rigid rotor for the rotational part, and simple harmonic oscillator for the vibrational part? Or perhaps the problem is considering both aspects together.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). But which of these requires less energy?

I need to find the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions and see which is smaller.

The energy levels for vibration are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. The difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = (1 + 1/2) h w - (0 + 1/2) h w = h w.

For rotation, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J +1) ) * (ħ² / (2 I)), where I is the moment of inertia. The change from J=0 to J=1 would be ΔE_rot = E_1 - E_0 = [2 * ħ²/(2I)] - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So I need to compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot and see which is smaller. The photon with the corresponding energy would cause the transition.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, so it's the transition with the least energy required. So we need to find which of the two (vibrational or rotational) has a smaller ΔE.

Let me compute both.

First, compute ΔE_vib = h w.

h is Planck's constant, approximately
