Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think this through.

The question says we have two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the speeds. Newtonian mechanics would say 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but relativity doesn't work that way because of the velocity addition formula. Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). 

So plugging in the values: v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) → (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²)/(c²)) → that denominator becomes 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. That would match option C or D, since both say 0.14c.

Wait, but the options for relative speed are A) 1.1c, which is impossible because nothing can go faster than c. Then B) 0.1c, which is the Newtonian approach. C and D have 0.14c, which is what I calculated. So the relative speed should be 0.14c, so options C or D.

Now for the total energy. The system's total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each's energy is gamma * m c². So for each, I need to find gamma.

For the first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) → v² is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36 c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Then energy is 1.25 * 2m c² → 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v² = 0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Gamma is 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 → approximately 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says 5mc². So it must be option C.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc², which points to option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), which matches options C and D.

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

This matches the total energy in option C.

### Conclusion
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
