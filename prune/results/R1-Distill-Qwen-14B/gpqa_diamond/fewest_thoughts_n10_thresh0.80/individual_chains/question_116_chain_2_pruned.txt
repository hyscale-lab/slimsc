Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get pretty tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that triplet and quartet splitting usually come from neighboring protons. The triplet with 6H at 0.9 ppm sounds familiarâ€”maybe that's from a methyl group adjacent to some other CH2 groups. Wait, 6H in a triplet suggests two neighboring groups because the splitting is n+1, so a triplet implies each proton has two neighbors. Like, maybe two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Oh wait, wait. A triplet for 6H would be three protons each with two neighbors? No, wait, each H in a triplet has two adjacent sets. So for 6H, maybe each is part of a CH2CH2CH3 structure? Wait, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, 0.9 ppm is a classic methyl group. If it's a triplet, perhaps it's attached to a CH2 group. So imagine two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 would be next to the CH2, which has two protons. So the CH3's protons would split into a triplet. Wait, each CH2 has two H's, so the CH3's would each see two neighboring H's, which would split into a triplet. So if there are two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2, that would give 6H (each CH3 has 3H, two of them make 6H) each as a triplet. That fits the first signal.

The second signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to a CH2 group with three neighboring protons? Or wait, quartet is n=3, so neighbors with 3H each. Wait, no, no, quartet is splitting into four peaks. So each H is adjacent to a CH3, perhaps. Because a quartet implies each proton is next to a group with three H's. So if the 4H is a CH2 group next to a CH3, each H in the CH2 would have three neighboring H's, leading to a quartet. So the CH2 would be between two CH3 groups? Wait, but in that case, each CH2 would be next to two CH3 groups. Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to another CH2 which is connected to a CH3.

Wait, let me think. Let's see: the CH2 group in the middle, connected to two CH3 groups. So each CH2 proton is next to two CH3 groups, each with three H's. Wait, but that would cause each CH2 H to have two neighboring groups with three H's each, which would lead to more splitting. Because each H in CH2 is next
