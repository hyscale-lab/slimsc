Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. We're supposed to find the final product from the options given. The data provided are IR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is a reagent for the hydrolysis of esters, maybe? Or wait, no, wait. Oh, right! Red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions. Wait, no, another thought—maybe it's the hydrolysis of nitriles? No, I think that's more with H3O+ and something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI—maybe it's about the hydrolysis of an ester. Because I remember that esters can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form carboxylic acids. But wait, another possibility: when an ester is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it might be a way to convert the ester into an acid. Because I think that red phosphorus and HI can act as a catalyst for such reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

But let me focus on the structure of Compound X first, using the given spectral data.

Let's look at the NMR first. The 1H NMR shows several signals.

The signals are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong downfield shift. Common in alcohols or carboxylic acids, but wait, but if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an -OH group. Or maybe an aldehyde proton? No, aldehyde protons are around 9-10, but they are usually split a certain way. Wait, but in some cases, like in a conjugated system, they might be upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid -OH, but those are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So maybe X has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but if X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong acid, maybe X has an ester group. Because esters can undergo hydrolysis. Oh, but the IR data has a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound has a carbonyl group. Now, where?

If the 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl, what could that correspond to? That peak is typically for esters or ketones. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak is usually around 1700, but maybe higher? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think. Carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1, as well. The IR given has a 3400–2500 cm^-1 range, which suggests O-H (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid). So possible options: maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid with an ester group? No, that seems unlikely.

Wait, the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad region, which usually indicates an O-H stretch. So, maybe the compound has an -OH group. So combining that with the 1720 peak, which is a carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester with an -OH group somewhere else.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the NMR again.

The 1H NMR:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) — possibly an -OH proton.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. So, maybe a para-substituted benzene.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) — maybe a CH adjacent to some electronegative group, like an oxygen. Or perhaps a methylene group next to something else.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) — perhaps another CH2 group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) — a methyl group adjacent to something, maybe an oxygen, as in an ether or ester.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) — a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Putting that together,
