Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The question provides IR and NMR data for Compound X as well. So first, I should figure out what Compound X is based on the spectroscopic data, and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me start by analyzing the IR data. The IR peaks can tell me about the functional groups present in Compound X. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But since the options include carboxylic acids, maybe an O-H stretch. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be due to aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe Compound X has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a pretty high chemical shift, which suggests an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So that fits.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets in the aromatic region. The integration is 2H for each, so likely a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield peak (8.0 ppm) would correspond to more deshielded protons. So maybe a substituent on the benzene ring that's electron-withdrawing, like a carbonyl group.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet in the 2.9 region. That might be a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, like near a carbonyl. For example, in a ketone or maybe an ester.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating for 2H. Maybe these are CH2 groups, perhaps part of a chain attached to the aromatic ring.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for 3H. A methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH2 group, maybe like a (CH2)2CH3 structure or something similar.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group, like part of an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which matches the IR data. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or ketone, but the O-H would be present only in the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but another possibility is that the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in this case, it's a broad singlet. Aldehydes are usually sharp, so a broad peak might be more consistent with a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a -COOH group and some substituents.

Looking at the aromatic protons: the doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm with two protons each suggest a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps the substituent is at the para position, and the substituent has a -COOH group attached. Wait, but the substituent might be more complex.

Looking at the NMR data again, the 2.9 ppm multiplet is 1H, and the 1.7 ppm is 2H. That could be a three-membered chain, like CH-CH2-CH2-... or perhaps a branching. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to another group, like a ketone.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes a carbonyl group. Let me think about the possible structure.

So, the 10.5 ppm is probably the COOH proton. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are the aromatic protons. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to the carbonyl, and the 1.7 (m,2H) and 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H) could form a chain like (CH2)2CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, let's try to map the NMR. The aromatic region: two doublets, each 2H, so maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but each substituent would cause a pair of doublets. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group that's causing the protons to split into those doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring,
