Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So we need to find the value of 'a' from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that for a wave function to be physically valid, it needs to satisfy a few conditions. One of them is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Because usually, the wave function is a complex function, but the form here... Let me think. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait, but that could be written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (i/2), right? So ψ(x) is a complex function with a real part and an imaginary part.

But wait, the wave function must be such that the probability density is real and non-negative. Oh, right! Because the probability density is |ψ(x)|², which is ψ*(x)ψ(x), the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate.

So, the probability density here would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (i/2) ) ] multiplied by [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (i/2) ) ].

Let me compute that. Expanding that product, it's (a²)/(1+x) + (a/(1+x)) * (i/2) - (a/(1+x)) * (i/2) ) + (i/2)(-i/2). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me do it properly.

The product is (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) * (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i ) = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5
