Hmm, okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed of one with respect to the other and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. For the relative speed, I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So since they're moving in the same direction, I think I subtract the smaller speed from the larger one. Let me make sure I get this right.

So astronaut A has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut B has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. Wait, but wait! The question is about their relative speed. So I think the formula is (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). So v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c.

Plugging in the numbers: numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c when rounded. So that's one part; the relative speed should be around 0.14c.

Now, what about the total energy of the system? Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I think I need to calculate the total energy for each and sum them up. The energy of an object is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute each one's energy.

First astronaut (2m, 0.6c):
Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)
0.6 squared is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. Then energy is gamma * m * c². But wait, the mass here is 2m, so 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):
Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2)
0.5 squared is 0.25, so 1-0.25=0.7
