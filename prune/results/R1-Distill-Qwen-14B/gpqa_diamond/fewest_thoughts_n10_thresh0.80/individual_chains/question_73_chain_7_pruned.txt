Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because things like length contraction and time dilation come into play. Oh right, so I need to use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

First, I think I should tackle the relative speed part. The question is asking for the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. Or wait, is it the relative speed between them as observed from some other frame? Hmm, wait no, when the problem says "relative speed," it's the speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first astronaut's frame of reference.

Wait, no, wait. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference in their velocities divided by (1 plus the product of their velocities over c squared), I think. Because of the velocity addition formula in relativity.

The formula for relative velocity v_rel is (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the observer. Wait, in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

So the numerator is (0.5 - 0.6) c = (-0.1 c). The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (-0.1 c) / 0.7. That gives approximately -0.142857 c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A? Wait, but both are moving in the same direction. Oh wait, wait. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c, same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving slower, but in the same direction. So their relative speed should be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, but wait that's the classical approach. But in relativity, it's not that straightforward.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think. The correct formula for the relative velocity is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)), but wait, that's when u is the velocity of the object as seen from the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the observer's frame relative to the lab. Hmm, perhaps I need to figure out each astronaut's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first
