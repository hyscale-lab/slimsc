Okay, I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. The question says they introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. So, I think that means they added the HA tag right at the beginning of the GADD45G coding sequence.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressing as expected. So, something went wrong with the construct.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I see it starts with 5' ATG, which is the start codon methionine. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, HA tag is a specific sequenceâ€”does this match? The HA tag is usually a short peptide from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The most common HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, I think. But the question says they introduced the HA sequence. So how was it introduced?

Wait, the first part of the coding sequence after ATG is TAC. Let me translate that. ATG is Met, TAC is Tyr. So the first amino acids are Met, Tyr. But the HA tag starts with YPY. Hmm, wait, the HA tag's N-terminal is usually a short peptide. Let's see: the HA epitope is from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The commonly used HA tag is: 

YPYDVPDYA 

That's from the HA1 subunit. So the HA tag is about 10 amino acids. So in the DNA, the HA tag would be a series of codons encoding that.

Looking at the construct sequence, right after the start codon (ATG), the next codons are TAC, which is Tyr. Then CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), etc. Wait, that doesn't look like the HA sequence.

Wait, the HA sequence in DNA would be the coding strand. Let's see: the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA.

Let me write the DNA for that. Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, P is CCA, Y is TAC, A is GCT (wait, no, A is GCT in coding DNA? Wait, DNA is written 5'->3', and mRNA is complementary to the DNA coding strand. So for each amino acid, the DNA would be the coding (sense) strand.

So Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, P is CCA, D is GAT, Y is TAC, A is GCT.

So the HA tag would be: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT.

Wait, but the construct starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... which is ATG followed by TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... which would translate to Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val...

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, so the first amino acids should be Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Tyr Ala. So the initial part of the coding sequence should be TAC (Y) CCA (P) TAC (Y) GAT (D) GTT (V) CCA (P) GAT (D) TAC (Y) GCT (A). So that's 10 codons, right?

But in the given sequence, after ATG, the next codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, G..., let me see:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So that's 5 codons. So the first 15 nucleotides:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G...

So, the first 15 nucleotides would give Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val.

Wait, that would be 5 amino acids. The HA tag is longer, 10 amino acids. So perhaps the construct doesn't include the entire HA sequence. Or maybe the HA was added incorrectly.

Wait, the question says they modified the coding sequence by introducing the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So they should have the HA sequence before the GADD45G
