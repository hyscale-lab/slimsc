Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, right?

The question states that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So, same star masses, same planet masses. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The key data given are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7. Wait, but what does this shift depend on? I think the amplitude of the Doppler shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh, but since both are detected using RV, their orbits must be inclined so that the Doppler effect is measurable. I think we can assume the same inclination for both, or maybe it's not needed because the problem says the shifts are given, so maybe the actual shift is what matters.

Wait, the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the star's mass. The formula I remember is something like V = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / (4π²) )^(1/3) * (M_star + M_planet)^(-2/3) ) * (1/(a * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ), but wait, maybe that's more complicated than needed.

Alternatively, I've heard that the semi-amplitude K of the RV method is given by the formula K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (1 year)^1/3 * sqrt(1 + M_* / M_p)) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe it's better to think about the simplified version when the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which is the case here because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun.

So, if M_p << M_*, then M_*
