Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star move. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are probably gas giants, but Neptune-sized. The RV method detected these planets, and I need to find out how the orbital periods compare between the two.

Wait, the problem gives the wavelength shifts: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift (K) to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P * (2π)) )^(1/3) ) ), but maybe I should think about it in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, actually, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, right? Because K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )... No, wait, perhaps I'm getting it confused. Let me think again.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/ (P * (2π) )^(1/3) ) ). Oh, that's complicated. But since the planet masses are similar to Neptune and the stars are similar to the Sun, M_p is much less than M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Also, the planets have circular orbits (given), so e=0, and the (1 - e²)^½ term becomes 1. So the formula simplifies a bit.

So K ≈ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let's reorganize this. Let me write it more neatly.

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should recall the simplified version. I think that when the planet is much less massive than the star, the formula for K is approximately K ≈ (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P) )^(1/3) )

Alternatively, perhaps it's better
