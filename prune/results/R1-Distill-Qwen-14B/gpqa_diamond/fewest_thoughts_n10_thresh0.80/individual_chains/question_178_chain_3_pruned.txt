Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question gives a Lagrangian term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm, I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of fields and coupling constants plays a role in determining renormalizability. The idea is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions (or at least non-negative). Wait, or is it that the interaction terms must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4 in 4 dimensions? Because in 4D spacetime, the action must be dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian should have [L] = 4. Let me think about the structure of this term.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}. Let's break down each part.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ in 4D is 3/2. So ψ̄ would have the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. Because ψ̄ is the adjoint, but dimensionally, it's the same as ψ.

Then, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since the gamma matrices γ are dimensionless (they are just matrices, not operators with dimensions), σ_{μν} is also dimensionless.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field. Wait, no, wait, in this case, ψ is a spinor, so perhaps this is a non-Abelian gauge field? Or maybe it's electromagnetism. But F^{μν} for a gauge field is typically antisymmetric, and its dimension depends on the gauge field.

Wait, in Maxwell theory, the field strength F_{μν} has dimension [mass]^2. Because A_mu, the gauge field, has dimension 1. The field strength is the derivative of A plus the commutator (for non-Abelian), but in any case, each derivative brings a mass dimension of 1, so F^{μν} would be [∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ], so each term is [mass]^1 * [mass]^1 = [mass]^2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each part's dimensions: ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the term κ multiplied by that must have dimension 4, since the Lagrangian has to be dimension 4 in 4D spacetime.

So [κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F)] must be 4. So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =4.

Wait, [ψ̄ σ ψ F] is [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F]. Since σ is dimensionless, it contributes nothing. So [ψ̄] = 3/2, [ψ] = 3/2, [F] = 2. So adding those: 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. So [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] =4-5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So that would be
