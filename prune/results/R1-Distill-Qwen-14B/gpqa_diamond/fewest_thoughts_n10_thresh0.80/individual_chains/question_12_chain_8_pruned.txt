Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given as Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. We need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each giving two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of mu(+) and the neutrino, respectively. Or wait, no, neutrinos are leptons, so maybe their rest mass is negligible? Hmm, but in this case, the question mentions the rest mass of Pi and mu, but not the neutrino. So I guess the neutrino's rest mass is considered zero.

Wait, the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. So the products are a muon and a neutrino. Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, we can treat it as massless, but for the muon, we have to consider its rest mass.

The Pi+ is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the Pi+, which is 139.6 MeV. The final energy is the sum of the energies of mu+ and nu. Each of their energies is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy.

Wait, but the neutrino's rest mass is zero. So its energy is just its kinetic energy, which is equal to the magnitude of its momentum times c, but since we'll be working in units where c=1, that's just |p| for the neutrino. Similarly, the muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu.

So, setting up equations:

Energy conservation: m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
Momentum conservation: p_mu = p_nu, but opposite in direction.

Since p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c, and for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c because m_nu c² ≈0. So E_nu = p_nu c.

Wait, let me write this more carefully.

Let me denote:
m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
m_nu = 0.

Initial energy: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

Final energy: E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (p_mu)^2 c² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) 
But since I'm working in units where c=1, it's sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 )

E_nu = p_nu c = p_nu (since c=1, but really, it's just p_nu * c, but perhaps in these units, it's just p_nu. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think in terms of units where c=1, so energy is in MeV, mass is in MeV/c², but when c=1, mass is in MeV. So m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV, and m_nu is 0.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 )
E_nu = p_nu

Momentum conservation: p_mu + p_nu = 0 → p_mu = -p_nu → but since they are vectors, their magnitudes are equal and opposite. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, p_mu = p (let's call it p), and p_nu = p in magnitude. So, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²)
E_nu = p.

So, energy conservation: m_pi = E_mu + E_nu → m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

We can solve for p.

So let's write the equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Let me denote sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) as S.

So, 139.6 = S + p → S = 139.6 - p.

But S = sqrt(p² + 105.7² ), so square both sides:

(139.6 - p)^2 = p² + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2 * 139.6 p + p² = p² + 105.7².

Subtract p² from both sides:

139.6² - 2 *139.6 p = 105.7².

Compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2.

139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 ≈ 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 → 19600 - 112 + 0.16 → 19488.16 MeV².

105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 → 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 → 11172.49 MeV².

So:

19488.16 - 2*139.6 p = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 -11172.49 = 2*139.6 p → 8315.67 = 279.2 p.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2 *30 = 8376, minus 279.2 *0.3=83.76 → 8376-83.76=8292.24. Hmm, but 279.2 *29.7 ≈ 8292.24, which is less than 8315.67.

The difference is 8315.67 -8292.24 =23.43. So 23.43 /279.2 ≈ ~0.084.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, since c=1, the units are MeV. So p ≈29.78 MeV/c *c =29.78 MeV.

Wait, is that right?

Wait, let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 × 29.784.

Wait, maybe better to just compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Using calculator steps:

279.2 × 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 -279.2 =8376-279.2=8096.8. Hmm, no, wait 279.2 ×29 is 279.2 * (30-1) = 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8.

Wait,
