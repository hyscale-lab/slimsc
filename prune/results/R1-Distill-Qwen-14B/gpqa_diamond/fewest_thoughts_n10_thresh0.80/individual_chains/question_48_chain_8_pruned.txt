Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Let's take it step by step. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Let me jot down each step and see what's happening.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine, forming product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When you add bromine (Br2) to a ketone, I think it's a type of addition reaction. Oh wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition, but Br2 is more about electrophilic addition. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe it's an enolate formation or some kind of bromination via a different mechanism. Wait, no, another thought: cyclohexanone can undergo bromination via the enol mechanism. So, the reaction of ketones with bromine usually leads to the dibromide. Because in the presence of a base, it can form the enolate, which attacks Br2. But wait, without a base, maybe it's just the addition of Br across the carbonyl. Wait, no, cyclohexanone is a ketone, and adding Br2 would typically lead to the formation of a dihydroxy dibromide. Or wait, I think when ketones react with bromine, it's called the haloform reaction? No, wait, the haloform reaction is when you have a methyl ketone reacting with X2 (like I2) in presence of a base. So maybe in this case, cyclohexanone doesn't undergo haloform because it's not a methyl ketone. So perhaps the initial reaction is an addition of Br across the carbonyl group.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a bromination via the enolate. Wait, maybe it's a diaddition. So, cyclohexanone plus Br2 would form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, perhaps it's an epoxide formation, but no, that's with peracid. So, when a ketone reacts with Br2, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation. Oh wait, no, bromohydrin would be when you have a water and Br2, but in this case, it's just Br2.

Wait, another approach: product 1 is formed by adding Br2 to cyclohexanone. I think the correct product here is 1,2-dibromocyc
