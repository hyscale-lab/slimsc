Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric tensor describes the geometry of the space. So, the first thing I should probably do is figure out what kind of space this metric represents.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². That looks similar to the equation of a sphere. Because x² + y² = r² would be a circle, but here the denominator is 4 minus that. So the condition for the denominator not being zero would be x² + y² < 4. So we're working in a region where x² + y² is less than 4. Hmm.

I think this might be related to a hyperbolic space or some kind of pseudosphere. Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But wait, maybe this is a two-dimensional space with a specific metric.

Wait, to find the area of the pseudosphere, I probably need to compute the volume in this metric. Wait, but since it's a two-dimensional metric, maybe it's a surface, and the area would involve an integral over the metric.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of dx² + dy², scaled by 32/(4 - x² - y²). So this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? So the area element dA would be the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy.

Let me think about the metric tensor components. The given metric is in the form ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². But looking at the given ds², it's [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx² plus the same term for dy². So the off-diagonal terms (g_{xy}) are zero. So the metric tensor is diagonal, with g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

The determinant of the metric tensor g is then (g_{xx}) * (g_{yy}) - (g_{xy})². Since g_{xy} is zero, the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

The area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt of [32²/(4 - x² - y²)^2] ] times dx dy. That simplifies to 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but wait, 32 is a number. So dA = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Now, the area of the pseudosphere would be the integral of dA over the region where x² + y² < 4. Because the denominator becomes zero when x² + y² =4, which is the boundary.

So the area A is the double integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Hmm, integrating this might be tricky, but maybe we can switch to polar coordinates because of the x² + y² term. Let me try that.

In polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So substituting, the integral becomes the integral from r=0 to r=2 (since 4 is 2²) and θ from 0 to 2π.

So substituting, A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first: ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution to solve this integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4.
