Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is about identifying the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what X is based on the given IR and NMR data, and then determine the reaction's outcome.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since the other options don't seem to have amines, maybe it's an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's common in ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. Another peak at 1610 cm-1 suggests either aromatic C=C or possibly a conjugated carbonyl. The 1450 cm-1 peak is around where aromatic C-H bending (like in substituted benzene rings) occurs.

Now the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is a sharp singlet or broad singlet. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton because they usually appear around 10-12 ppm and are broad because they are exchangeable. So that suggests that the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This is typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets indicate two sets of equivalent protons. So, the ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, the integration is 2H each. So maybe it's like a di-substituted ring, but para to each other. Alternatively, if it's a meta di-substituted, the splitting might be different. Hmm, but the fact that both are doublets suggests that each set of protons is coupled to two others—like a para situation where each pair is adjacent to substituents in the para positions.

Then, looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So, the 0.9 ppm triplet likely comes from a methyl group attached to something that's split into a triplet. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet of 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something else, maybe a CH2. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) and 2.9 ppm (1H) multiplet could be a CH2CH(CH3) group or something similar.

Wait, let me think about this. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3. But the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which is more like a (CH2)m group attached to a CH(CH3). Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group?

Wait, maybe it's an isobutyl group. Because an isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, actually, an isobutyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) but wait, no: the isobutyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, wait. Isobutyl is -CH2CH2CH(CH3), but wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.

An isobutyl group is a four-carbon branch: the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the main chain. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the NMR. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) would be the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH2. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is two protons, perhaps a CH2 connected to another CH2 or to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a single proton, maybe a CH connected to other carbons.

Putting this together, perhaps we have a group like CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3 or something similar. Wait, but wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the main structure. So, let's see: in a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the CH(CH2CH3) would have two adjacent CH2 groups.

So for the NMR of a sec-butyl group: the terminal CH3 (ethyl end) would be a triplet at around 0.9 ppm, as each of the three H are attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. The next CH2 would be a quartet at around 1.2–1.5 ppm, and the CH (the one connected to the aromatic ring) would be a triplet around 2.3–2.5 ppm. But wait, in the given data, the CH2 is at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Hmm, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a different branching.

Wait, another possibility: the chain could be a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon. So, maybe -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Then the NMR would show for the CH2CH3 group (the end) as triplet at 0.9 ppm, the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet at around 1.5 ppm, and the CH (the one attached to the ring) would be a quintet or something else. But in the data, the CH is at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, and the adjacent CH2 is at 1.7 ppm. Maybe that's a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the
