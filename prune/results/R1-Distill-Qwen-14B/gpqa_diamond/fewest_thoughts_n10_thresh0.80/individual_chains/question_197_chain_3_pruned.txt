Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me go through this step by step.

First, let's look at the data given. The compound X has IR and NMR data. I'll start by analyzing the IR to understand what functional groups are present.

The IR peaks given are:
- 3400–2500 cm⁻¹: This broad range suggests the presence of X-H stretches. If it's a strong, broad peak around 3400, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, since there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which would fit here. Alternatively, an ester or ketone might show a peak around 1720. But let me think—carboxylic acids also have a broad O-H peak around 2500-3000. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but 1720 cm⁻¹ is a bit high for a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 1700. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or an acid chloride, but acid chloride's would be higher than 1720, maybe. Wait, no, maybe it's an ester or maybe a ketone? But looking at the NMR data for more clues.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

The peaks are:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet at around 10.5. That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton. Because aromatic protons are usually around 7 ppm, and aldehydes are around 9-10. A broad peak suggests exchange, which is typical for carboxylic acids. So that supports the idea that the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two aromatic protons, as a doublet. Maybe para-substituted, as para would give two doublets each integrating to 2H. 

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, integrating to 2H. So this fits a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, a substituent at the para position, causing two doublets for the adjacent protons. Like if it's a benzene ring with substituents in positions 1 and 4, with the others being hydrogen.

Then the other signals:
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something else, like a CH2 or another CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to 2H, possibly a CH2 group next to another CH or maybe part of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a double (d). A doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to something
