Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titration of acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to figure out the initial steps. The problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that's mixing equal volumes, which would dilute the concentration by half. Let me calculate that.

The initial moles of acetic acid are volume (L) times molarity. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Got that.

Now, when we titrate this diluted acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration? I think that means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So first, I need to find out the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH will equal the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will neutralize all the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume (V) = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.
