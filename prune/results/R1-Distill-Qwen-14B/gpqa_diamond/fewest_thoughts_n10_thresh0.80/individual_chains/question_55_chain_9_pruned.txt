Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different acetates: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, and Trans-butenyl.

First, I need to understand what each of these compounds looks like. I remember that propenyl and butenyl groups are alkenyl groups. Propenyl has a three-carbon chain with a double bond, while butenyl has a four-carbon chain with a double bond. The 'cis' and 'trans' refer to the configuration around the double bond.

Wait, wait. Let me get the structures straight. Cis-propenyl acetate would have the double bond in the propenyl group with the substituents on the same side. Similarly for the others. So, the structure would be an acetate where the ester group is attached to a propenyl or butenyl group.

Looking at the NMR data:
- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq)
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

Hmm, let's think about what each signal represents.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is likely the acetate's methyl group (OAc group). The OAc is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet because all three protons are equivalent.

Now, the other signals are from the propenyl or butenyl group. Let's consider the possible structures.

If it's a propenyl group, the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, acetate is OAc, so the ester is R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. No, the ester group is R-O-COOR. Wait, no, esters are typically R-O-CO-R. So in this case, the compound is R-OAc, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, no, acetate would be OAc, so the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So, an ester would be RCOOR'. So, for example, propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2CO-O-CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe the structure is CH2CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the structure as the ester: R-O-CO-CH3. So R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So, R-O-CO-Me, where Me is methyl.

So, the R group is either propenyl or butenyl, with cis or trans configuration.

Now, let's look at the NMR signals.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a high coupling constant, which suggests it's between two protons on adjacent carbons with a double bond. So, maybe it's a vinylic proton.

The 5.5 ppm is a dq. So that's another vinylic proton, perhaps coupled to two different sets of protons.

The 1.6 ppm doublet is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, perhaps in a CH2CH2 structure.

Wait, let me think about how the protons would split in each case.

For the propenyl group, the structure would be CH2CH2-OAc. Wait, no. Let me write down the structures.

Propenyl group: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? Or is it CH2=CH-OAc? Wait, no, the acetate ester is R-O-CO-Me, so the R would be the propenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So, the R group is CH2CH2CH2-OAc, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to draw the structure.

Alternatively, the structure might be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-Me. Wait, maybe I should think of the ester as OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, no, that would be propenyl. So, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? Or CH2=CH-OAc? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals
