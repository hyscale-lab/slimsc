Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh wait, I remember that the density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So for a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Oh right, I think that refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states, where each point on the sphere corresponds to a quantum state.

But wait, what exactly is the Bloch vector? Oh, right, any single-qubit state can be written as a vector r on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and for a mixed state, it's more complicated. But in this case, the given ρ seems to be a mixed state because it's a convex combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩. 

Wait, wait, let me compute ρ. So |0⟩⟨0| is the projector onto the state |0⟩, same for |1⟩⟨1|. So when I add them and multiply by 1/2, I get ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write this out as a matrix.

The |0⟩ state is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix [[1, 0], [0, 0]]. Similarly, |1⟩ is [0; 1], so |1⟩⟨1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]. Adding these together gives [[1,0], [0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiply by 1/2, so ρ is (1/2) * I, where I is the identity matrix. So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Now, how does this relate to the Bloch sphere? I remember that the Bloch vector r for a density matrix ρ is given by the off-diagonal elements. The density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Let me write that out.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the expression (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 equals ρ.

Wait, wait, no, the correct formula is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So let's set that equal to the given ρ, which is (1/2)(I). Because ρ is (1/2)I, so (I + r·σ)/2 = (I)/2.

Multiplying both sides by 2, I get I + r·σ = I. Subtract I from both sides: r·σ = 0. So each component of r must be zero because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are all non-zero matrices. So the only solution is r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Wait, but the origin in Bloch sphere terms is the completely mixed state. The density matrix (I/2) is the maximally mixed state. So the state is equally likely to be |0⟩ or |1⟩, which makes sense because that's what the density matrix represents. So the position is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. The density matrix is diagonal, which suggests it's a mixed state along the z-axis, but wait, in the Bloch sphere, the z-axis corresponds to σ_z. But since the off-diagonal terms (from σ_x and σ_y) are zero, the vector points only in z, but wait, in this case, since the entire r·σ term is zero, all components are zero. So the state is at the center of the sphere, which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) for a density matrix \( \rho \) is related to the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. For the given \( \rho \), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Equating this to the general form \( \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} \), we find:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

This implies that all components of \( \mathbf{r} \) (i.e., \( r_x, r_y, r_z \)) must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state, where the qubit is equally likely to be in \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \).

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( r = (1, 1, 0) \)**  
**B) \( r = (0, 0, 1) \)**  
**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \)**  
**D) \( r = (1, 1, 1) \)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Answer: C
