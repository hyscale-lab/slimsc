Okay, so I've got this question about the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. Hmm, I need to figure out which assumptions lead to that approximation. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The question says that the impulse approximation assumes nucleons behave like free particles. So, I'm guessing this has to do with how the interactions are treated in the nucleus. The options are four assumptions, and I need to pick which three jointly imply the impulse approximation.

The four assumptions given are:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

The options are combinations of these. Let's go through each assumption one by one.

Assumption 1: Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So, this would mean that the interaction is treated as if each nucleon acts independently, not considering their overall arrangement or interactions with others. That sounds like a part of the impulse approximation because it treats each nucleon as if it's free.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, what does that mean? Transparency in this context probably refers to the concept where the nucleus doesn't significantly change the trajectory of a particle, except when it interacts with a specific nucleon. So, if the nucleus is transparent, it's like the rest of the nucleons don't affect the interaction. That would imply that the selected nucleon is treated as a free particle because the others don't influence it during the interaction. That fits with the impulse approximation because it ignores the many-body effects except for the individual nucleon.

Assumption 3: The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Quarks being non-relativistic would imply that their kinetic energies are much lower than the rest mass energy, so relativistic effects are negligible. But how does that relate to the impulse approximation? Well, the impulse approximation is a model where the nucleus is treated as a collection of free nucleons, but perhaps this assumption is about the internal structure of the nucleon. If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe it simplifies the model, treating the nucleon as a point particle without considering its internal dynamics. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I remember that the impulse approximation neglects the internal structure of the nucleon and treats it as a point-like object. So, if the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps the internal motion is treated classically or in a way that doesn't require considering relativistic quantum effects. So this assumption might be part of the approximation because it allows treating the nucleon as a simple object.

Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh right, binding forces refer to the nuclear force holding the nucleons together. If the approximation assumes that the nucleon is not bound, then it's treated as if it's free. So this definitely supports the impulse approximation because it ignores the binding forces, making
