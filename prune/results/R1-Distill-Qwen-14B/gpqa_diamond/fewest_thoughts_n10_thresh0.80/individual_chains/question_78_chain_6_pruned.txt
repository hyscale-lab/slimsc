Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generation time is v.

I need to find the expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr. So, the charge has been moving, and we're looking at the fields at a later time.

Wait, I remember that the scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward. It's like Coulomb's law divided by charge, right? So V would be (q)/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because you have to consider the retarded time and maybe some other factors.

Wait a second, the retarded time is when the fields are calculated based on where the charge was at an earlier time. So the scalar potential might involve the position of the charge at that earlier time.

But looking at the options, options A and B have V as (q)/(4πε₀ r), which is the static case. But if the charge is moving, maybe the denominator isn't just r but something else. Oh wait, wait, because the charge's position has changed, so the distance isn't just r. Hmm, but the options C and D seem to have more complicated denominators.

Wait, the vector potential A usually involves the velocity of the charge, right? Because for a moving charge, the magnetic field comes from its motion. The vector potential is related to the velocity. So maybe when the charge is moving, the vector potential depends on v.

In the static case, the vector potential A might be zero because there's no current if the charge isn't moving. But when it's moving, you do have a current, so A becomes non-zero.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions. Let me try to recall. The scalar potential for a moving charge is similar to the static case but considering the position at an earlier time. So the distance isn't just r but the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. Oh, right! The vector d is the displacement from the charge's position at tr to the point r. So the distance is |d|, which would be sqrt(d·d) if d is a vector.

So the scalar potential V would involve the charge divided by the permittivity and the distance. That would be (q)/(4πε₀ |d|), but wait, I think in the expressions given in the options, they use 'd' as a scalar, which is the magnitude of the vector d. So, maybe 'd' is |d|.

But looking at the options, option C and D have denominators with (d c - d·v) or something. Hmm, why would the denominator include terms with velocity?

Wait,
