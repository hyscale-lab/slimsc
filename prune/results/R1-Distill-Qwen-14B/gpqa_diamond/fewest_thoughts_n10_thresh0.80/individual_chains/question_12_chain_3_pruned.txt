Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and their decay is a common topic in particle physics. 

The question says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino is probably massless or has a negligible mass compared to these, so I'll assume its rest mass is zero. 

Wait, but wait, the neutrino has some mass, but for most problems like this, we neglect it. So I'll go with that assumption. 

The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to keep the total momentum zero. 

So, the conservation of momentum tells me that the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) is equal to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). 

Now, thinking about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c². After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). And for the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu c. 

So the conservation equation is: m_pi c² = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c. 

Wait, because p_mu = p_nu = p, since their momenta are equal and opposite. So this simplifies things. 

Let me let E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + m_mu² c^4 ), and E_nu = p c. 

So the equation becomes: m_pi c² = sqrt( p² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c.
