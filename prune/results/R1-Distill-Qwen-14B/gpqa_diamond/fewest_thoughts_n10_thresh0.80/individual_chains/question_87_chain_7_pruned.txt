Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a specific di-substituted aromatic compound. Hmm, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, wait. A benzene ring is six carbons, so substituting two groups would add two more carbons? Or maybe each substituent brings more? No, wait, wait. Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so the benzene ring has two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8. So the benzene (6 C) plus two substituents, but what are the substituents?

The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents must include a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester?) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. So the structure is something like a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (maybe a ketone, like a benzophenone derivative) and a halogen attached. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so the two
