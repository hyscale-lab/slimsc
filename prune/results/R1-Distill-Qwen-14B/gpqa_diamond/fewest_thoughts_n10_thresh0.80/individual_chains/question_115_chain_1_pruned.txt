Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. Right, when particles annihilate, like an electron and a positron, they produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, their combined momentum must be conserved. Also, energy is conserved. Since they annihilate into two photons, those photons must carry the total momentum and energy.

Wait, but each photon's energy is the same. So both photons have equal energy. And their directions are both towards the right, but one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So, their directions are symmetric in some way.

I remember that in such annihilation processes, the photons are emitted in opposite directions if the initial particles are moving directly towards each other. But wait, the problem says the electrons are moving along the same horizontal axis but opposite directions. So they collide head-on.

But the photons, each have the same energy, but their angles are measured from the horizontal axis. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their directions form a certain angle between them.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions. So if one is at an angle θ above the horizontal, the other is at θ below. So the angle between them would be 2θ. Or perhaps the angle between their directions in space, so maybe 180 minus 2θ? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

But to find θ, I think I need to use conservation of momentum and energy.

Let me think about the initial momentum. The electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta will add. But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its momentum direction is opposite to the electron's.

So, the Lorentz factor (gamma) is given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

The momentum of a relativistic particle is p = gamma * m * v. But since they're moving in
