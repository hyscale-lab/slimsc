Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, the parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So plx = 1/distance. But wait, no, I think the formula is plx (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So we're looking at how the density changes as parallax changes. The options are all in terms of inverse powers of plx: 1/plx^4, 1/plx^2, etc. So I need to find the function that describes the number of stars per unit plx as plx varies.

Since stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, I think that means their distribution in space is uniform. So density is constant, right? So the number of stars depends on the volume. But wait, parallax is inversely related to distance. So maybe I need to think about how the volume in a shell of radius r relates to parallax.

Let me think: The distance d is related to parallax plx as d = 1/plx. So plx = 1/d. So when plx increases, d decreases. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would depend on the solid angle and the volume of the shell.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell between distance d and d + dd is the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars. Since the distribution is uniform, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in the shell is proportional to the surface area. The surface area of a shell at radius d is 4πd². So the number of stars in that shell is 4πd² * n, where n is the number density.

But we can express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, substituting, the number of stars would be proportional to (1/plx)^2, because d² is (1/plx)^2. So the number of stars in the shell is proportional to 1/plx².

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So we need to find how the number of stars in a range of plx (like delta plx) changes with plx.

So if plx is small (which means d is large), the number of stars in a fixed delta plx would be higher because each delta plx corresponds to a larger volume? Or maybe I got that backwards.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars per unit plx is the number of stars in a small range delta plx. So for a given plx, the number of stars per delta plx is the number of stars in that delta plx.

But from earlier, the number of stars in a shell at d is proportional to d², which is 1/plx². So if I have a small delta plx, how does the number of stars in that delta relate to plx.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume V is n*V, where n is the number density. Let's think about the range in plx. Since plx = 1/d, the range of plx from plx to plx + d_plx corresponds to a range of distance from d to d - dd (since d decreases when plx increases). Wait, no, because plx increases as d approaches zero.

Wait, the range of plx from plx to plx + delta_plx would correspond to a range in distance from d = 1/plx to d' = 1/(plx + delta_plx). So the distance difference is (1/(plx + delta_plx)) - (1/plx). But for small delta_plx, maybe I can approximate this as a differential.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the number of stars per unit plx as a function. Let me model this.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = 4πd² n dd, where n is the number density.

But since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) d_plx. Because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d_plx.

Wait, more accurately, when plx increases by d_plx, d decreases by (d_plx)/(d^2). Because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd/d_plx = -1/(d^2) = - plx². So dd = - plx² d_plx.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way. So substituting dd into N:

N = 4πd² n * dd

But dd = - plx² d_plx. So substituting:

N = 4π d² n * (- plx²) d_plx

But d² is (1/plx)^2, so:

N = 4π (1/plx²) n * (- plx²) d_plx

Simplify: the plx² cancels, so N = -4π n d_plx.

Wait, but N is the number of stars in a range of plx d_plx, but the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. So taking the absolute value, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1 (since it's 4π n). But that can't be right because the options don't have a 1/plx^0, which is a constant. So maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d plx) as a function.

So dN = 4π d² n dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 n (-1/plx²) d_plx.

Wait, because dd = d_plx * (d d / d plx). Since d = 1/plx, dd/d_plx = -1/plx².

So plugging in: dN = 4π (1/plx)^2 * n * (-1/plx²) d_plx.

So dN = -4π n (1/plx^4) d_plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is dN/d_plx = -4π n / (plx^4).

But the negative indicates that as plx increases, the number decreases. Since the question is about how the number changes, the magnitude is what matters. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would imply that the number of stars decreases rapidly as plx increases. But that doesn't seem right because when plx is small (large d), the volume is larger, so more stars. Hmm, maybe I messed up the substitution.

Wait, let me go back. The number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness in distance (dd). But the thickness in plx is d_plx. So how to relate dd to d_plx?

We have plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Differentiating, dd = - d_plx / (d^2) → dd = - (d_plx) * plx².

So substituting into the number of stars:

dN = 4π d² * n * dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * n * (- plx² d_plx) )

Calculating, the 1/plx² * plx² cancels to 1, so dN = -4π n d_plx.

Wait, that suggests that dN/d_plx = -4π n, which is a constant. But that can't be right because as plx increases, the number of stars should decrease.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Earlier, I thought the number of stars per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4, but now I'm getting a constant. That doesn't make sense. Probably, I made a mistake in my substitution.

Let me try another approach. Let's consider the number of stars within a certain range of plx. Let's say plx ranges from plx to plx + delta_plx, which corresponds to distances from d = 1/plx to d' = 1/(plx + delta_plx).

The volume between these two distances is V = (4/3)π (d')^3 - (4/3)π d^3.

But for small delta_plx, we can approximate this as the volume element in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the number of stars per unit volume as n (constant). So the number of stars in a volume dV is n dV.

So dV can be expressed in terms of plx. Let me model this.

The volume between plx and plx + d_plx is the volume between distances d and d + dd, where d =1/plx and dd is the change in d corresponding to d_plx.

We have d = 1/plx → dd = - (d_plx)/(d^2) = - (d_plx) * plx^2.

So the volume element dV is the volume of a spherical shell: 4π d^2 dd.

Substituting dd:

dV = 4π d^2 * (- plx^2 d_plx) ) → dV = -4π (1/plx^2) * plx^2 d_plx = -4π d_plx.

Wait, so the volume element is -4π d_plx. The negative indicates that when plx increases, the volume decreases (since you're looking at closer stars). But the number of stars in this volume element is n dV.

So dN = n dV = n (-4π) d_plx.

Wait, that suggests that the number of stars per unit plx is n * (-4π). Which is a constant. So the number of stars per unit plx is constant, regardless of plx? But that can't be, because when plx is small (large d), the volume per unit plx is larger, so more stars. But according to this, the number per unit plx is the same. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of stars per unit distance and per unit parallax. Let me think again.

Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV. So n is the number density, say stars per cubic parsec.

So when you have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the number of stars is n * 4πd² dd.

But we're interested in how this number relates to a change in plx. Since plx = 1/d, dd = - (d^2) d_plx.

Substituting, the number of stars is n *4πd² * (-d^2 d_plx) ) = n *4π d^4 (-d_plx).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that substitution.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d_plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² d_plx.

Wait, that's better. So substituting into dN:

dN = n * 4π d² * dd = n *4π d² * (-d² d_plx) ) = -4 π n d^4 d_plx.

But since d = 1/plx, d^4 is (1/plx)^4.

So dN = -4 π n (1/plx^4) d_plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is dN/d_plx = -4 π n / plx^4.

The negative sign just shows that as plx increases, the number of stars decreases, which makes sense because higher plx corresponds to closer stars, but the volume per unit plx decreases. Wait, but according to this, the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So when plx is small, the number of stars per unit plx is larger.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what intuitively makes sense. Because when plx is small (distance large), the volume per unit plx is bigger, so more stars in that plx range.

Wait, no, because in the equation, the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4. So for small plx (like plx approaching zero), 1/plx^4 becomes very large. Which would mean that as you go to larger distances (small plx), the number of stars per unit plx increases. But that can't be right because as you go further, the number of stars you can see in a given plx range should decrease, since the total number of stars is finite and spread out.

Wait, no, wait. The number of stars in the shell at distance d is proportional to d². So when d is large, the number of stars in that shell is larger. But when you change plx, which is 1/d, the number of stars per unit plx depends on how the shells are distributed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider integrating over a certain range. Let's say I have a range of plx from plx to plx + delta_plx. How does the number of stars in that range depend on plx.

Wait, the volume between plx and plx + delta_plx is V = (4/3)π ( (1/(plx + delta_plx))^3 - (1/plx)^3 ).

But for small delta_plx, we can approximate this using calculus. Let me take the derivative.

The number of stars dN in a small delta_plx around plx is given by:

dN = n * (dV/d plx) * delta_plx.

So dV/d plx is the derivative of the volume with respect to plx.

The volume at distance d is V = (4/3) π d^3 = (4/3) π (1/plx)^3.

So dV/d plx = derivative of (4/3 π 1/plx^3) with respect to plx.

Which is (4/3 π) * (-3) plx^(-4) ) = -4 π plx^(-4) = -4 π / plx^4.

So dN = n * (-4 π / plx^4 ) * delta_plx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx is dN/d plx = -4 π n / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So as plx decreases (distance increases), the number per unit plx increases. Which makes sense because at larger distances, each unit of plx corresponds to a larger volume, so more stars.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

But wait, the options are the number of stars per unit range of plx. So the answer is A.

Wait, no, wait. The options are about how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So the function is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A, which is ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell and the thickness in distance. The surface area of the shell is \( 4\pi d^2 \), and the number of stars in this shell is \( 4\pi d^2 n \, dd \), where \( n \) is the constant number density of stars.

To express this in terms of parallax, we use \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), so \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the expression for the number of stars in the shell, we get:

\[
dN = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 n \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
dN = -4\pi n \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is then:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = -4\pi n \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that the number of stars decreases as parallax increases, which is consistent with the fact that closer stars (higher parallax) are fewer in number per unit parallax. The magnitude shows that the number of stars per unit parallax is inversely proportional to \( \text{plx}^4 \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \), making the correct answer:

**Answer: A**
