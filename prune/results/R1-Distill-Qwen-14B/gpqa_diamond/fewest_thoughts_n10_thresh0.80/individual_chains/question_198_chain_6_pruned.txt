Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The problem is about a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what each β represents. Stability constants (β) are for the formation of complexes. Each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is probably the formation of the monosubstituted complex, β2 the disubstituted, and so on.

Wait, but the way they're ordered: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β increases up to β3 and then drops for β4? That's a bit unusual. I guess each β corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ligands, so [Co(SCN)]^n- or something like that.

The problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So I'm looking for the concentration of the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex relative to all the other Co species.

So the approach is probably to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then add up the fractions for each species. Then, the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) species is the one we need.

But wait, how do stability constants work? The stability constant for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is defined as:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n)

So each β represents the formation from the previous complex. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The overall formation would be from the free ions. So maybe the general
