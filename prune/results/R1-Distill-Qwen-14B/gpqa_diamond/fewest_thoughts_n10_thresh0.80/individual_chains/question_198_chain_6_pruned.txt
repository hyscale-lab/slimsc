Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The question is about finding the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution.

Let me read the problem again. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? I think Co(SCN)_2 is blue, maybe that's the one referred to as the dithiocyanato complex. Or wait, no, the different complexes have different colors. I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ or something like that. But the exact number of SCN- ligands in the complex isn't specified. Oh wait, the stability constants are given for complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ions. So β1 is for [CoSCN]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on? Or maybe the charges are different. I might need to think about that.

Stability constants (β) are defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For a general reaction: Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}. So for each n, βn is the formation constant.

The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complexes. So, for each possible complex, their concentrations are determined by the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution of the complexes depends on the β values and the ligand concentration. The most stable complex (highest β) isn't necessarily the most abundant because it also depends on the ligand concentration and the number of ligands.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each cobalt species (from n=0 to n=4) and then sum the fractions for the desired complexes. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Write the formation equations for each complex.
2. For each complex, write the expression for the fraction of Co in that complex.
3. Sum all fractions to get the total, then find the fraction for the desired complex.
4. Convert that fraction to a percentage.

But wait, how do we model this? Let me think. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^0

Hmm, but calculating each term might be complicated because each depends on the others. Maybe it's easier to use the method where we find the fraction of each species based on the relative stabilities and ligand
