Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it involves cobalt ions and thiocyanate. I remember that cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate, and these complexes have different stability constants. The question is about finding the percentage of a specific blue dithiocyanato complex among all the cobalt species.

Wait, the problem gives me the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh right, stability constants tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So the higher β complexes will form more easily.

The solution has [Co(II)] at 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] at 0.1 M. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm guessing the blue one is either the Co(SCN)_2 or maybe Co(SCN)_3? Or maybe another one? Well, I'll have to think about the possible complexes.

Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So the possible species are Co(SCN)^-, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)3²−, and Co(SCN)4^3−? Or maybe the charges are different. Hmm, not sure about the exact charges, but the formation depends on the concentration and the stability constants.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Oh, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So Co(SCN)_2 would be that, the dithiocyanato complex. But wait, the problem says 'blue dithiocyanato', so I think that refers specifically to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is blue. Or maybe another one. I'll have to find the correct one.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the fraction of each complex. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ions. But since the solution is at a certain concentration and has a lot of SCN-, most of the Co will be in the complex forms.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, then sum them and find the percentage of the desired complex.

But how do I calculate the fraction of each complex? I remember that for each complex, the fraction can be calculated using the stability
