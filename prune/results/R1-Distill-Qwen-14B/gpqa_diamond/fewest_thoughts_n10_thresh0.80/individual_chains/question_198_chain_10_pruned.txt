Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll do my best.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that when metal ions are in solution with ligands, they form complexes, and the stability constants (β) tell us how stable each complex is.

So the setup is: we have Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) in solution. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, what's the order here? Oh right, βn is the stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is the complex with one SCN- ligand, β2 with two, and so on.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is usually blue. So that's the n=2 complex. But wait, what about the other complexes? There's Co(SCN)_3^3+ (maybe blue too?), but I think the main point is to find the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2.

But wait, the question is about all cobalt-containing species. So that includes all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion. The total concentration of all these species must add up to the initial concentration of Co^2+.

I think the approach here is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants. The idea is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to the others, then sum them up and find the percentage that corresponds to the blue dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

Wait, but how do the stability constants work? Each βn represents the equilibrium for the nth complex. For example, the first complex [CoSCN]^+ would have β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]). Similarly, β2 would be the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ from the first complex adding
