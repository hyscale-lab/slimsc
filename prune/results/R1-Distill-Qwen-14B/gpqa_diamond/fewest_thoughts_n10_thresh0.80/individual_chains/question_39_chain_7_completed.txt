Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the value of 'a' is. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's interesting because normally wave functions can be complex, but usually when we talk about probabilities, we deal with the modulus squared. Hmm.

The key point is that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. For it to be zero, each part must be zero. So when is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i equal to zero?

Wait, a complex number is zero only if both the real and imaginary parts are zero. So for the wave function to be zero, both a/sqrt(1+x) must be zero, and the imaginary part 0.5 must be zero. But wait, 0.5i can't be zero unless 0.5 is zero, which it isn't. So this suggests that the wave function isn't zero except when the real part cancels the imaginary part somehow. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function given is not the entire picture. Maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the given function is the part of the wave function inside that region, and it's zero outside. Because the problem states that none were found outside x<1 and x>3.

Wait, but the wave function can't just be zero outside because the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe that's the form of the wave function in the region where the particle exists, which is between 1 and 3. So the wave function is non-zero between 1 and 3 and zero elsewhere.

But wait, the wave function is a function that's normalized. So the integral of the modulus squared over all space must be 1. Because when you square the modulus, you get the probability density, and the integral gives the total probability, which is 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i, but only for x between 1 and 3. And zero otherwise. So to find 'a', I need to normalize this function.

Wait, but actually, wait a second. The square of the modulus of ψ(x) is |ψ(x)|². So in the region x ∈ [1,3], ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

Because the wave function is zero outside this interval, the integral from 1 to 3 is the entire integral. So:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So:

a² [ ln(1+x) ] evaluated from 1 to 3.

Which is a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Then the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So adding both parts:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So,

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore,

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which matches this.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Compute ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is about 0.6931, so ln(4)=1.3862.

So [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] is ln(4/2) = ln(2) = 0.6931.

Ah, right, so the integral a² * ln(2) is correct.

Then 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. a is sqrt of that, which is about 0.849, so 0.85 is the closest option. So the answer is B.


To determine the value of "a", we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

This wave function is non-zero only in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \), as particles are not found outside this interval. To normalize the wave function, the integral of the modulus squared of \( \psi(x) \) over this region must equal 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1
\]

### Step 1: Integral of \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \)
The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) with respect to \( x \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[ \ln(1+x) \right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left( \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right)
\]

Using the property \( \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \), this simplifies to:

\[
a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Step 2: Integral of \( 0.25 \)
The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
Adding the two contributions, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

### Final Answer
The value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
