Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it through and try to figure out what's going on. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a reaction.

Alright, the reaction setup: Compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used in ring-opening reactions, especially for epoxides. So maybe Compound X is an epoxide that undergoes some kind of ring-opening here.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So perhaps the reaction is opening an epoxide and leading to a diol or something else. Or, maybe it's a different kind of reaction, but given the conditions, ring-opening seems likely.

Now, looking at the NMR data of the product. Let's start with the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, in the 1H NMR, we have two singlets for 3H each. Singlets usually mean no neighboring hydrogens. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have adjacent Hs, like carbonyls or aromatic rings with substituents that prevent splitting.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). Hmm. So there are four doublets in the aromatic region. Wait, let's count the Hs:

- 6.75: 1H, d
- 7.08: 2H, d
- 7.68: 1H, d
- 7.71: 2H, d

That's a total of 6 aromatic hydrogens. So the molecule must have a benzene ring with substituents. Let me think about the pattern. Each doublet implies coupling with one other proton. So perhaps a para-substituted ring or a meta substitution?

Wait, let's think about the 13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

So, the 13C NMR shows nine signals. The carbons include two methyls (21.3 and 28.4), some aromatic carbons, and a couple of carbons at higher shifts, like 197.7, which is a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester. Oh wait, but the problem says the product is formed after ring-opening... Hmm, perhaps it's an aldol addition or some other carbonyl formation.

Wait, the starting material is an epoxide (since the reaction involves a ring-opening base). So when epoxides open, usually we get diols. But if the epoxide is part of a styryl group, perhaps the ring-opening leads to a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but in this case, the base would open it in a different way. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. It's often used in epoxide ring-opening, especially in more substituted epoxides, leading to trans diols, but sometimes it can lead to different products if there's another leaving group or some conjugate addition.

Wait, looking at the options for Compound X:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide.

All these options are epoxides with a styryl group attached. Styryl is an arylvinyl group, like a benzene ring attached to a double bond.

If the reaction is ring-opening of the epoxide, then the product would have something derived from the epoxide. Let me think about each option.

Wait, but wait. The reaction uses 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Epoxides typically react with such bases in a ring-opening via a nucleophilic attack. But wait, wait, wait: no, I think I might be getting this wrong. Diazabicyclooctane is a base, but it's more about deprotonation. Wait, in epoxide ring-opening, the base would deprotonate a hydrogen adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, leading to an alkoxide which attacks the less substituted epoxide carbon. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but given the base, that's less likely.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction isn't ring-opening. Alternatively, the base might be used for some elimination or other reaction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an enolate or something else, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me look at the product's NMR data again.

In the 1H NMR, two singlets for 3H each. So two methyl groups, perhaps attached to carbonyl groups or to something else that doesn't split their signals.

Wait, but in the 13C NMR, there's a carbon at 197.7, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone (usually around 205-220, but maybe it's an ester or something else). Wait, 197 is a bit low for a ketone. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually higher. Or perhaps an ester carbonyl or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone, which
