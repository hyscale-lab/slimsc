Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question gives me a lot of data about the star and the two planets. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Each planet's mass and radius are given, but I'm not sure if those matter directly for the equilibrium temperature.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Oh right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it's in thermal equilibrium, considering the star's radiation. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, there's also the planet's albedo, but the question says both have the same albedo, so that cancels out in the ratio.

So, the key here is to find the ratio T1/T2. Since albedo is same, the ratio would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). But I need a1 and a2, the orbital distances.

Wait, how do I get a1 and a2? The question gives me information about the Doppler shifts from the RV method. Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift in the spectrum lines is related to the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the period, but in this problem, we don't have the period. Alternatively, the Doppler shift can be used to find the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, but the problem states that both planets induce periodic shifts in the forbidden line. The shifts are up to 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the Doppler shift. The formula for K is (v) = (2πG P)^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the planets have circular orbits, e=0, so we can ignore that term. Also, since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (2πG P)^(1/3) * (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/( (1 + (M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) )) ) Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * ( (2π/P)^2 )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) )

No, maybe I should think about the relation between K, the velocity, and the other parameters. Alternatively, for a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )^(1/3) ) )

But since e=0, this simplifies
