Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. They react violently and release gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, wait, same number of n and p? Oh, that means the molecule is probably something like CO2 or something else where each atom has equal n and p.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or each atom in the molecule? No, the molecule as a whole. So the total number of protons in the molecule equals the total neutrons. Like, for example, if it's O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O has 8 p and 8 n each, so O2 would have a total of 16 p and 16 n. That fits. Or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of p and n. But let me think more about that later.

Moving on, when the reaction happens, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, and B has a melting point close to 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, so B is probably something that melts just above freezing, like water. But wait, melting point of water is 273 K, so 277 is just a bit higher. Hmm. Maybe something like ice, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe another substance.

Wait, another thought. 277 K is around 4°C. What substances have a melting point near there? Maybe something like paraffin wax, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps B is some other compound. Let me come back to that.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, a keto acid is a carboxylic acid. For example, acetic acid is CH3COOH, which is a keto acid. When X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. Wait, X is a reagent in organic chemistry. One common reagent is NaOH, but that's a base. Another is KMnO4 or other oxidizing agents. Alternatively, maybe X is something like LiAlH4, which is a strong reducing agent. But wait, the product when X reacts with a keto acid has two O atoms. Let's think: if X is a reducing agent, perhaps it reduces the keto acid. Let's see, for example, if X is LiAlH4, then reacting with a carboxylic acid (keto acid) would produce an alcohol. For example, CH3COOH reacting with LiAlH4 would become CH3CH2OH, which has an OH group. Wait, but that would have an O, but the product in this case has two O atoms. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, alternative: Substance X could be something like sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which is a reducing agent. When it reacts with a carboxylic acid, perhaps it doesn't reduce it, but maybe it's a different reaction. Or maybe X is something else.

Wait, the question also says that substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That suggests that X has an element with a heavier isotope present. For example, sodium has isotopes like Na-23 (most common), but also Na-24 or Na-25, but those are rare. Or perhaps something like Cl, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37 as common isotopes. Or maybe it's something else.

Looking back at the reaction: violent reaction with liquid Y. What liquids react violently? Maybe something like water. For example, sodium reacts violently with water, producing hydrogen gas (H2), sodium hydroxide, and heat. So if Y is water, then substance X could be a metal like Na, Mg, K, etc. Then gas W would be H2, which is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so the molecule H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But that doesn't fit the condition that protons and neutrons are equal. Because 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so that's not equal. So maybe not H2.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe gas W is CO2? Let me see: CO2 has one C (6 p, 6 n) and two O (8 p, 8 n each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So W would be CO2, which has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the condition. So gas W is CO2.

If X reacts with Y to produce CO2, then Y might be a carbonate or some other compound that would release CO2 upon reaction. Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid? Or maybe X is a metal and Y is an acid, producing CO2. Wait, but that would require X to be a metal that reacts with an acid to produce CO2. For example, if X is sodium (Na) and Y is a carbonate, then the reaction would be 2 Na + Na2CO3 → 3 Na2CO3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with an acid to produce CO2. But wait, which metals would produce CO2 when reacted with an acid? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, another approach: if W is CO2, then the reaction of X and Y produces CO2. So possible reactions could involve carbonates or perhaps something else.

Wait, if X is a metal, and Y is water, then perhaps X is a metal that reacts with water to produce CO2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate. So if X is a strong acid, like HCl, and Y is a carbonate, say Na2CO3, then the reaction would be 2 HCl + Na2CO3 → 2 NaCl + CO2 + H2O. So gas W is CO2, which fits the condition. But then X is HCl, but the problem says that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope, which would make sense for Cl, which has multiple isotopes (like Cl-35 and Cl-37). So X could be HCl, but that's an acid, and the product
