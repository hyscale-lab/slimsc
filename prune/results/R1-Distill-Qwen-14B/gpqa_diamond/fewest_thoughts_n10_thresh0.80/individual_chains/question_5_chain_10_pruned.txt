Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So the operator P acting on this eigenvector will just give back the same vector multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components along X, Y, and Z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P itself must be the vector sum of these components in the direction of n. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, operators for spin components are often represented as vectors, so P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, which means that the y-component of n must be zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z). Because it's a direction vector, it should be normalized, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

The eigenvector we're looking for is in the direction of n because the eigenvalues correspond to the components of spin along a specific direction. Right, I think the eigenstates of the spin operator along a direction n are spin-up and spin-down along that axis. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, it's the spin-up state along n.

So to find the eigenvector, I need to construct the operator P for the given direction n and then find its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem gives us the matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since
