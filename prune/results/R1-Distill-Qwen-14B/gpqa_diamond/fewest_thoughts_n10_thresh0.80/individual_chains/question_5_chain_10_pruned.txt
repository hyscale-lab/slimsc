Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They provided the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices, each multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, right. So P is a vector operator, and each component (Px, Py, Pz) is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. They want the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P in the direction n.

Wait, I think I remember that when dealing with the expectation of a vector operator in a particular direction, it's related to the eigenvalues of the component in that direction. So the operator P in the direction n would be the dot product of P with n, right? Like P·n. And the eigenvalues for that would be ±ħ/2, I think.

But the question here is about the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to P·n = ħ/2.

But wait, how do I find P·n? Let me think. The direction n lies in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that, because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, actually, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n would just be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So direction vector is along x and z.

So P·n is the sum of the components: Px * sinθ + Pz * cosθ. Oh wait, no, because n is a unit vector, so P·n = Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz * n_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0. So P·n = Px * n_x + Pz * n_z.

But I'm given that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of P·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, another approach: the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n. Because each component of P is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So Px = (ħ/2) σx, Py = (ħ/2) σy, Pz = (ħ/2) σz.

So P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0, so P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz).

So the operator for P·n is (ħ/2) [n_x σx + n_z σz ].

We're looking for the eigenvector of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2)|+> |ψ>

Dividing both sides by ħ/2, we get:

(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |+> |ψ>

Where |+> is the eigenvalue +1. So we can write the equation as:

(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>

Hmm, but wait, I think the eigenvalue for P·n is ±ħ/2, so when we write the equation, it's [P·n] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equation as:

[P·n] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So substituting in P·n, it's (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Multiplying both sides by 2/ħ, we get (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix equation is:

[ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Because |ψ> is a 2-component vector [a; b].

So let's compute the matrix:

n_x σx is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]

n_z σz is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding them together gives:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the equation becomes:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a - n_z b = b

Wait, no: [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by [a; b] equals [a; b].

So:

(n_z a + n_x b) = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0  ...(1)

(n_x a - n_z b) = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0   ...(2)

So that's two equations:

(1) (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

(2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

This system should have a non-trivial solution. So the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

Wait, but in this case, the system comes from the equation (M - I) |ψ> = 0, where M is the matrix, and I is identity. So the condition is that (M - I) is singular, which requires determinant(M - I) = 0.

But for an eigenvector, perhaps it's easier to find the ratios a and b. Let me proceed.

From equation (1):

(n_z - 1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z - 1 )

But wait, if I substitute this into equation (2), let's see:

Equation (2): n_x a = (n_z + 1) b.

Substituting a from equation (1):

n_x [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1) ) ] = (n_z +1) b

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1) to eliminate denominator:

n_x (-n_x b) = (n_z +1) b (n_z -1 )

Simplify:

- n_x² b = (n_z² -1) b

Assuming b ≠ 0 (since if b=0, a would also be zero, which would give trivial solution, not useful), we can divide both sides by b:

- n_x² = n_z² - 1

Let me rearrange this:

n_z² + n_x² = 1

But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1 (since n_y=0). So this equation is satisfied. So our substitution works.

So we have a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z - 1 )

But from equation (2), n_x a = (n_z +1) b.

Substituting a from equation (1) into
