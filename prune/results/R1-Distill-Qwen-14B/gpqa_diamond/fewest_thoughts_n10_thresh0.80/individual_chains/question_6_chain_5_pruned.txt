Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, the motion can often be broken down into radial and angular parts. But this potential depends on both r and θ, so it's not spherically symmetric. That complicates things a bit. Let me think about how to approach this.

The potential V(r,θ) has two terms. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator term in the radial direction. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Oh, wait, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So maybe substituting that in would help simplify the potential?

Let me rewrite V(r, θ) using that identity. So:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.
Wait, let me compute that. Let me compute each term:

The first term is (1/2)kr².

The second term: (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ).

So combining both terms, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, wait, let me add those terms correctly. The first term is (1/2)kr², and the second is (3/4)kr² (from the 3/2 multiplied by 1/2). So 1/2 is 2/4, plus 3/4 gives 5/4. So the potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, maybe that's not the most helpful way. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms that
