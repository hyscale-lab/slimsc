Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me think through this.

Alright, so both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. That's given. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's is about 33 days. That probably means Planet_1 is closer to its star since it's orbiting faster.

Now, the stars: the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, how does that work? I remember that more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, like a subgiant or something, which might have expanded a bit but not too much. So their radii are same, but Planet_1's star is more massive.

I think the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star, and the orientation of the orbit. Oh, right, the transit probability is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but wait, no, wait. I think the formula for the probability is (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait, the probability of a transit is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in terms of the star's radius) and the orbital inclination. Wait no, more accurately, the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the ratio (a / (R_star * sqrt(a² + R_star²))), but I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2 * ( (a) / (sqrt(a² + R_star^2)) ) or something like that. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The probability P is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_s / m_p)^(1/3))) ), but wait, is that correct? I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think a simpler
