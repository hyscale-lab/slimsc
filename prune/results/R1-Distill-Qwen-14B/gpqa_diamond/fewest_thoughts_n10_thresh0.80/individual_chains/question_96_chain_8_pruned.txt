Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given data is the distance to the galaxy and the angular size of the event horizon. Oh right, the event horizon's angular size is measured as θ=10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs.

Wait, I remember that the event horizon radius is given by the Schwarzschild radius. The formula for Schwarzschild radius is R = 2GM/c². But how does that tie into angular size and entropy?

So, angular size θ is related to the actual size of the object and the distance to it. The formula I think is θ ≈ (size) / distance, where θ is in radians. But since θ here is given in degrees, I'll need to convert that to radians first.

Let me jot down the steps I need to take:

1. Convert the angular size θ from degrees to radians.
2. Use θ = R / d to find the Schwarzschild radius R.
3. Using R, find the mass M of the black hole.
4. Calculate the entropy S of the black hole using the formula S = (kc³A)/(4ħG), where A is the area of the event horizon.
5. Alternatively, I think there's a more straightforward formula for entropy: S = ( (π c³ A ) / ( ħ G k ) ) * something. Wait, the exact formula might be S = (k c³ A) / (4 ħ G), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh, right! I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to compute A.

Wait, no, the exact formula I recall is S = ( (k c^3) / (4 ħ G) ) * (A), where A is the area. Or maybe it's (k c^3)/(ħ G) multiplied by something else. Hmm, I think the correct formula is S = ( (k c^3 A) )/(4 ħ G ), but I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should double-check that. Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula says S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) * something? Wait, no, the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, let me think. The area A of the event horizon is 4π R². So once I have R, I can find A.

So let's start with step 1: converting θ from degrees to radians.

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees.

To convert to radians, we multiply by π/180. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180.

Let me compute that. 1e-17 * π ≈ 3.14e-17, divided by 1
