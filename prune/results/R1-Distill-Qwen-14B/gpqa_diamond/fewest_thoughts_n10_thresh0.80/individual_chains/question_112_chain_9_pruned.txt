Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a state vector |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Up and down are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I know that |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system. The state is given up to a proportionality constant, so I'll probably need to normalize it first. 

The question then asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So, the matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator's matrix elements are Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would mean A12 = A21 = hbar/2, and A11 = A22 = 0. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2   0 ]

Wait, no, wait, wait. Or is it that the diagonal elements are hbar/2? No, the problem says Aij is hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. So the diagonal is zero, off-diagonal is hbar/2. So yeah, the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. 

Wait, but that's a spin operator matrix. What does that operator represent? Oh, because in Pauli matrices, the sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So if A is proportional to sigma_x, perhaps. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

The task is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A. Also, calculate the average value of A. 

So, first step: find the eigenstates of operator A. Because the measurement probabilities depend on the projection of |alpha> onto those eigenstates.

So, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, it's manageable.

The matrix A is:
[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Let me denote hbar as ħ for simplicity. So A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) = 0. So,

| -λ    ħ/2   |
| ħ/2   -λ    | = 0

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) ) = λ² - (ħ²/4) =0.

So, λ² = ħ²/4 => λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Now, find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) v = 0.

[ -ħ/2    ħ/2 ] [v1]   [0]
[ ħ/2   -ħ/2 ] [v2] = [0]

The first equation: -(ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T.

But we can normalize it. The length is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is |e1> = (1/sqrt(2)) |up> + (1/sqrt(2)) |down>.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

(A - (-ħ/2) I) v =0 → [ ħ/2    ħ/2 ] [v1] = [0]
                         [ ħ/2   ħ/2 ] [v2]

First equation: (ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2.

Eigenvector is [1, -1]^T, normalized as |e2> = (1/sqrt(2)) |up> - (1/sqrt(2)) |down>.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the matrix
