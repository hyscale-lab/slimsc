Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice organic chemistry question about Michael additions. The question has three parts (A, B, C) and each involves a reaction where a Michael donor reacts with a Michael acceptor. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I need to think through each reaction step by step.

Let's start by recalling what a Michael addition is. The Michael reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The donor is usually the enolate, and the acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Looking at the first reaction (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate when deprotonated. The other compound is the acceptor. 

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me draw this out. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, but in this case, it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so substituting on the third carbon would be CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, right? So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I've got the numbering wrong.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. So the structure is CH2-CH2 with the double
