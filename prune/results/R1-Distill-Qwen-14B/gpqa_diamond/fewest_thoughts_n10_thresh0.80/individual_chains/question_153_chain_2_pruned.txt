Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The question gives three different reactions, and I need to find out what the major products are for each.

Let's start by breaking down each reaction one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. The product is labeled as A.

I recall that dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate source. It acts as the nucleophile in the Michael reaction. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is the Michael acceptor because it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, with the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon (since it's 3-(p-tolyl)).

When the attack happens, the enolate's negative oxygen (from the malonate) will add to the beta carbon. So, the product should have the malonate part attached there. Wait, no, actually, the malonate is the nucleophile, and the acrylate is the electrophilic part.

So, the structure of the product A would have the malonate adding to the acrylate. The acrylate is E-configured, meaning the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. But for the Michael addition, the configuration might not matter as much as the connectivity.

After the attack, the product would have a new carbon-carbon bond. The acrylate's carbonyl becomes a ketone, and the malonate becomes part of the structure. Wait, no, dimethyl malonate is H2C(CO2Me)2. So when it acts as a nucleophile, the enolate would attack the acrylate's beta carbon, and upon protonation, we get a new compound.

So, the product A would have the structure where the malonate's CH2 groups are attached to the acrylate's chain. Let me try to visualize. The acrylate is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. The malonate would add to the CH2=CH part, so the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), leading to a new molecule.

Wait, no, the structure is E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-C-(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, the structure of methyl 3-(p-t
