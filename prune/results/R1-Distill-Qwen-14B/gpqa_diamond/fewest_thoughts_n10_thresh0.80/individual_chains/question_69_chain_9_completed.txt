Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the CERN Bubble Chamber. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10^-16 seconds. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle, right? So, when a particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. Oh, right, that's because of special relativity. The observed lifetime τ is gamma times τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. Wait, energy and mass are related through E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Since the particle is moving at high energy, maybe we can find its momentum?

Wait, no, wait. The energy given is the kinetic energy or the total energy? Oh, I think in such contexts, when they say energy, it's often the total energy unless stated otherwise. So E is 27 GeV, and the rest mass is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, so the total energy E is much larger than the rest mass, which means the particle is moving at a speed close to the speed of light.

So, gamma would be E/(m c²). Wait, E is in GeV, and m is also in GeV/c². Because E (in GeV) equals m c² (GeV) when m is in GeV/c². So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ) = approx 7.918.

Right, because 27 divided by 3.41 is about 7.918. So gamma is approximately 7.92.

Now, the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by tau0. So τ = gamma * tau0. tau0 is 8e-16 seconds, so τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait a minute. The lifetime we're talking about is the mean lifetime. The number of decays would follow an exponential decay, but perhaps we're looking for the average distance the particle travels before decaying.

Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so the distance it travels is v * τ. But wait, the proper lifetime is tau0, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau0. So the time it's moving is gamma tau0, and the distance is v multiplied by that. But wait, the velocity v can be approximated as c when gamma is high. Since gamma is 7.92, which is quite high, v is very close to c. So for approximation, v ≈ c = 3e8 m/s.

So the average path length L = v * tau = c * gamma tau0.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber. The Bubble Chamber detects particles by the tracks they leave, but to observe the decay, the daughter particles need to be close enough that their tracks can be distinguished. So the resolution refers to the minimum distance between the original point of decay and the point where the decay products are detected. Or perhaps the minimum separation that can be observed.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution to detect that a decay happened. Because if the decay occurs and the products travel a certain distance before being detected, the detector must have enough resolution to see that they came from a single point. Oh wait, but the decay products would have their own velocities, but perhaps the question is more about the decay vertex—how far the decay occurs from the interaction point.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the decay length: the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The Bubble Chamber can only detect decays that occur within a certain distance from the interaction point. So the minimum resolution needed would be related to the decay length such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, we need to calculate the decay length L, and then find the fraction of particles that decay within a certain distance, say L_res, which corresponds to 30% of the decays.

Wait, but wait. The proper decay length is zero, but in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so it has a non-zero decay length. The average decay length is L_avg = v * tau. Wait, no, it's the mean decay length. So L_avg = v * gamma tau0. Because tau is gamma tau0.

Alternatively, the proper lifetime is tau0, so the proper decay length is zero, but in the lab frame, the particle is moving, so it has a lifetime gamma tau0. So the average distance it travels before decaying is v * gamma tau0.

But wait, v is beta c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So perhaps it's easier to compute beta gamma tau0. Wait, because L = beta gamma c tau0.

Wait, let's get back to the problem. We need to find the minimum resolution needed so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, the question is about the fraction of the time that the decay happens within a certain distance. So, the number of decays observed is 30% of all decays, which implies that the detection must be able to see the decay within a certain distance from the original point.

The decay length distribution follows an exponential decay. The probability that the decay occurs at a distance x < L_res is given by the cumulative distribution function of the exponential distribution. The probability P is equal to 1 - exp(-L_res / L_avg), where L_avg is the average decay length.

Wait, no, because the average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau0. So to have P = 30% = 0.3, we have:

P = 1 - exp(- L_res / L_avg) = 0.3.

Wait, but perhaps the 30% refers to the probability that the decay occurs within the resolution length. So, the probability that the decay occurs within L_res is 0.3. So,

P = 1 - exp(- L_res / L_avg) = 0.3.

We can rearrange this to solve for L_res.

So,

exp(- L_res / L_avg) = 0.7.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

- L_res / L_avg = ln(0.7).

So,

L_res = - L_avg * ln(0.7).

But wait, ln(0.7) is negative because 0.7 <1. So:

L_res = L_avg * [ - ln(0.7) ].

Calculating that:

ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

So,

L_res ≈ L_avg * 0.35667.

So the minimum resolution needed is 35.667% of the average decay length. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, because the average decay length is L_avg, and the question is what is the minimum L_res so that at least 30% of the decays are within that L_res. Hmm, no, wait, 30% of the decays within L_res. Wait, no, perhaps the fraction is the probability that the decay occurs within L_res. So, the above equation holds: P = 0.3 = 1 - exp(-L_res/L_avg).

So, L_res = L_avg * ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, let's redo that:

1 - exp(-x) = P → exp(-x) = 1-P → x = -ln(1-P).

So, x is L_res / L_avg = - ln(1-P) → L_res = L_avg * (- ln(1-P)).

So, with P=0.3,

L_res = L_avg * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L_avg * 0.35667.

Wait, but let me confirm:

ln(1/0.7) is ln(1.42857) ≈ 0.35667.

So, L_res ≈ 0.35667 * L_avg.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, the L_res would be the distance where 30% of the decays have occurred. So, we can calculate L_res as 0.35667 * L_avg.

But wait, perhaps I should make sure about the formula. The average decay length is L_avg = beta gamma c tau0. So let's compute that.

Wait, but first, let's compute beta and gamma. We have gamma = 7.918.

Beta is v/c. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Gamma is 7.918, so 1/gamma squared is approx (1/62.7) ≈ 0.01596.

So, beta squared is 1 - 0.01596 = 0.98404 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.992.

So, beta is approximately 0.992.

So, beta gamma is 0.992 * 7.918 ≈ 7.838.

So, L_avg = beta gamma c tau0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau0 is 8e-16 s.

So,

L_avg = 7.838 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this:

Multiply 7.838 *3e8 → 7.838 *3=23.514 → 23.514e8 = 2.3514e9.

Multiply by 8e-16:

2.3514e9 * 8e-16 = (2.3514 *8 )e(9-16) → 18.8112e-7 → which is 1.88112e-6 meters, because 1e-7 is 0.1e-6.

Wait, 18.8112e-7 is 1.88112e-6 meters.

So, L_avg is approximately 1.88e-6 meters, which is 1.88 micrometers.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting L_avg = beta gamma c tau0 = 7.838 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.838: 7.838 * 2.4e-7 ≈ 18.81e-7 = 1.881e-6 meters.

Yes, that's correct.

So, L_avg is 1.88e-6 meters.

Then, the required L_res is 0.35667 * 1.88e-6 m ≈ 0.35667 * 1.88e-6.

Let me compute that:

1.88 * 0.35667 ≈ approx 0.6707.

So, L_res is approximately 0.6707e-6 m, or 6.707e-7 m.

Wait, but wait! Wait a second, there's a mistake here. Because the problem states that the energy is 27 GeV, which is the total energy. So the mass is 3.41 GeV/c², so the energy is 27 GeV, which includes the rest mass and kinetic energy.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute beta and gamma more accurately.

Wait, E = gamma m c². So, gamma = E / (m c²) = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) ) = 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.918.

So, that's correct.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.918)^2 )).

Compute 7.918^2: 7.9^2 is 62.41, 7.918^2 would be approximately 62.696.

So, 1/62.696 ≈ 0.01594.

So, 1 - 0.01594 = 0.98406.

sqrt(0.98406) ≈ 0.99202, so beta is approximately 0.992.

So, beta ≈ 0.992, gamma ≈ 7.918.

So, beta gamma is 0.99202 * 7.918 ≈ let's compute that.

0.992 * 7.918 → 7.918 - 0.008 *7.918 → 7.918 - 0.06334 = 7.85466.

So, beta gamma is approximately 7.85466.

So, L_avg = beta gamma c tau0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau0 is 8e-16 s.

So,

L_avg = 7.85466 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.85466: 7.85466 * 2.4e-7 = ?

Compute 7 *2.4e-7 = 1.68e-6.

0.85466 *2.4e-7 = approx (0.8*2.4e-7)=1.92e-7, 0.05466 *2.4e-7= approx 1.312e-8.

So total: 1.68e-6 + 1.92e-7 + 1.312e-8 = 1.68e-6 + 0.192e-6 + 0.01312e-6 = (1.68 +0.192 +0.01312 )e-6 = 1.88512e-6 m.

So, L_avg is approximately 1.885e-6 m.

So, L_res is 0.35667 * L_avg = 0.35667 *1.885e-6 ≈ 0.672e-6 m, which is 6.72e-7 m, or 0.672 micrometers.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A) 2.08e-6 m, B) 2.08e-9 m, C) 2.08e-1 m, D) 2.08e-3 m.

Hmm, none of the options match approximately 6.7e-7 m. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read the problem again.

The question is: What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?

Wait, maybe the resolution refers to the proper time resolution or the distance resolution. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum distance that the detector can resolve to determine that the decay happened. So, if the decay length is L, the detector's resolution (minimum detectable distance) should be such that at least 30% of the decays are within that L.

Wait, another approach: The proper lifetime is tau0. The lifetime observed in the lab is tau = gamma tau0.

The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v tau = beta c gamma tau0.

We need to find the minimum resolution delta_L such that the probability P (decay occurs within delta_L) is 30%.

The probability that a decay occurs before a certain distance is given by the cumulative distribution function of the exponential decay:

P = 1 - exp( - delta_L / L_avg ).

We need P = 0.3.

So, 0.3 = 1 - exp(- delta_L / L_avg) → exp(- delta_L / L_avg ) = 0.7.

Take ln of both sides:

- delta_L / L_avg = ln(0.7) → delta_L = - L_avg ln(0.7).

As computed earlier, ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667, so delta_L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

Wait, but L_avg is the average decay length, which we calculated as approximately 1.885e-6 m.

So, 0.35667 * 1.885e-6 ≈ 0.672e-6 meters, which is 6.72e-7 m, or 0.672 micrometers.

But the options do not have this value. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of the time resolution. Because the lifetime is tau = gamma tau0, and the time resolution needed to observe 30% of the decays is such that the probability of decay within the time resolution delta_t is 30%.

Then, the time resolution delta_t would be delta_t = - tau * ln(1-P) = - tau * ln(0.7) ≈ 0.35667 * tau.

Wait, tau is gamma tau0 = 7.918 * 8e-16 s = 6.334e-15 s.

So delta_t = 0.35667 *6.334e-15 ≈ 2.25e-15 s.

But how does this relate to distance?

Because the Bubble Chamber's resolution is in terms of distance, not time. So perhaps the minimum distance is determined by the time resolution and the velocity.

Because the distance a particle travels is v * delta_t. So, delta_L = beta c * delta_t.

Wait, but that would be:

delta_L = beta c * (0.35667 * gamma tau0).

Wait, because delta_t is 0.35667 * tau, where tau is gamma tau0.

So, delta_L = beta c * 0.35667 * gamma tau0.

But wait, beta gamma c tau0 is L_avg.

So, delta_L = 0.35667 * L_avg.

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before, 0.67e-6 m. But again, that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing beta gamma. Let me re-calculate beta and gamma more accurately.

Given E = 27 GeV, m c² =3.41 GeV.

Gamma is E/(m c²) =27 /3.41 = 7.918.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (7.918)^2 = approximately 62.7 (since 7.9^2=62.41, 7.92^2=62.7264).

So, 1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.01594.

Thus, beta = sqrt(1 -0.01594) = sqrt(0.98406) ≈ 0.99202.

So beta gamma =0.99202 *7.918 ≈7.854.

So, L_avg = beta gamma c tau0 =7.854 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute: 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

7.854 *2.4e-7 = let's compute that.

7 *2.4e-7=1.68e-6.

0.854 *2.4e-7= 2.0496e-7.

So total is 1.68e-6 + 2.0496e-7 = 1.88496e-6 m.

So, L_avg is 1.885e-6 m.

Thus, delta_L = 0.35667 *1.885e-6 = 0.672e-6 m.

But none of the options match this. Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Wait, 0.67e-6 is less than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not using the average decay length but instead the minimum distance to capture 30% of the decays. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The number of decays within a length L_res is given by the probability P = 1 - exp(- L_res/L_avg).

Set P=0.3 → 0.3=1−exp(−L_res/L_avg).

So, L_res = L_avg * ln(1/(1−P)).

Which is L_res = L_avg * ln(1/0.7) ≈ L_avg *0.35667.

So, as before, 0.35667 *1.885e-6 = 0.672e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution (distance) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, perhaps the minimum L_res is such that the probability of a decay occurring within L_res is 30%, which would mean that the detector must have a spatial resolution (grain size) better than L_res, but perhaps the problem is considering the minimum distance to capture 30% of decays, so the experiment must have a resolution capable of detecting particles that have decayed within that distance.

But if the options don't match this, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the decay length in another way.

Wait, another way: The proper lifetime is tau0, and when the particle moves with velocity v, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau0.

The average decay length is L_avg = v * gamma tau0 = beta c * gamma tau0 = beta gamma c tau0.

So with beta gamma as 7.854, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s:

L_avg =7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.854 *3=23.562 → 23.562e8 *8e-16.

Wait, 23.562e8 *8e-16 = (23.562 *8) * 1e-8 = 188.496e-8 = 1.88496e-6 m. So same as before.

So, again, delta_L is 0.35667 *1.88496e-6 ≈ 0.672e-6 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution in the lab frame to detect the decay. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the time resolution, not the spatial resolution. But the question specifically asks for the minimum resolution, so I think it refers to the spatial resolution.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance without using the approximation that v ≈ c. Let's compute v precisely.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV.

So, (E² - (m c²)^2 ) = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 → 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719.

So, p c = sqrt(717.3719) GeV → approx 26.785 GeV.

So, p =26.785 GeV/c.

The momentum p is related to beta and gamma by p = gamma m v.

Wait, alternatively, beta = (p c)/(E).

So, beta = (26.785 GeV) / (27 GeV) ) ≈ 0.992037.

Ah, so beta is approximately 0.992037.

So, v = beta c = 0.992037 *3e8 m/s ≈ 2.97611e8 m/s.

So, more accurately, L_avg = v * gamma tau0.

gamma is 27 /3.41 =7.918.

So, L_avg = 2.97611e8 m/s *7.918 *8e-16 s.

Wait, compute 2.97611e8 *8e-16 = 2.380888e-7.

Multiply by7.918: 2.380888e-7 *7.918 ≈ (2.380888 *7.918 )e-7.

Compute 2.38 *7.918 → 2.38 *7 =16.66, 2.38 *0.918≈2.186 → total ≈18.846.

So, 18.846e-7 m is 1.8846e-6 m.

Same as before.

So, delta_L is 0.35667 *1.8846e-6 ≈0.672e-6 m.

Which is 6.72e-7 m. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the average decay length, not delta_L.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, if the average decay length is about 1.88e-6 m, then to see 30% of the decays, the detector's resolution must be at least up to 30% of the average decay length. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma tau0, which is 7.918 *8e-16 s = 6.334e-15 s.

Then, compute the distance the particle travels in this time: v * gamma tau0 = beta c gamma tau0.

Which is the same as L_avg.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the proper distance, but that doesn't make sense because in the proper frame, the particle doesn't move.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the speed as a fraction of c, and then compute the distance.

But I think I'm going in circles here.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma.

Wait, let me recompute beta gamma.

E =27 GeV, m =3.41 GeV/c².

Gamma =27 /3.41 =7.918.

Beta is (p c)/E.

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2) = sqrt(729-11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) ≈26.785 GeV.

So, beta =26.785 /27 ≈0.992037.

So, beta gamma =0.992037 *7.918 ≈7.854.

So, L_avg =7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by7.854 →7.854 *2.4e-7 = let's compute 7 *2.4=16.8, 0.854*2.4=2.0496 → total 18.8496e-7 m =1.88496e-6 m.

Again, the same result.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the average decay length multiplied by the natural log factor. But I'm not seeing any options that match.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question asks for the minimum resolution to observe any decay, not 30% of them. But the question says 30%.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Perhaps the question is about the minimum time resolution needed to observe the decay. So, the time resolution must be such that 30% of the decays are observed. The time resolution delta_t would then be delta_t = tau * (1 - (1-P)/P ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the time a particle lives is gamma tau0, and the minimum time resolution required is such that 30% of the decays happen within that time.

Wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau0.

The decay probability within time t is P=1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau0)).

Set P=0.3 → t= gamma tau0 * ln(1/(1-0.3))= gamma tau0 * ln(1/0.7) ≈gamma tau0 *0.35667.

So, t=7.918 *8e-16 s *0.35667 ≈7.918 *8e-16 *0.35667.

Compute 7.918 *0.35667≈ 2.829.

So, t≈2.829 *8e-16=22.63e-16 s=2.263e-15 s.

But how does this relate to spatial resolution? Because the distance the particle travels in time t is v t.

So, distance L= v t = beta c * t.

Which is beta c * gamma tau0 *0.35667.

Wait, beta gamma tau0 is the same as L_avg /c.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute L= beta c * t.

t= gamma tau0 *0.35667.

So,

L= beta c * gamma tau0 *0.35667 = beta gamma c tau0 *0.35667 = L_avg *0.35667.

Which brings me back to 0.672e-6 m, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is intended to find the minimum resolution in terms of the average decay length, and perhaps the options have a typo, but that's not helpful.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

B) 2.08e-9 m → 2.08 nanometers.

C) 2.08e-1 m → 20.8 centimeters.

D) 2.08e-3 m → 2.08 millimeters.

Hmm. My calculation gives ~0.67e-6 m, which is about 0.67 micrometers. But option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L_avg. Let me recheck.

Wait, beta is 0.992037, gamma is7.918.

So, beta gamma =0.992037 *7.918 ≈7.854.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau0 is 8e-16 s.

So,

L_avg = beta gamma c tau0 →7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute step by step:

7.854 *3 =23.562.

23.562 *8=188.496.

Multiply by 1e8 *1e-16 → 1e-8.

So 188.496e-8 =1.88496e-6 m.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the total energy E = K + m c². But wait, no, E is given as the total energy. Because if E were just the kinetic energy, then E = (gamma -1) m c². But in the problem statement, it says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Typically, that's the total energy. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution as the average decay length multiplied by (1-P), which would be 70% of the average. But that would be 0.7 *1.88e-6 =1.316e-6 m, which is still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the mean lifetime, and the distance is computed differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe a decay, which would be the distance that 30% of the particles decay beyond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the proper decay length. Since in the proper frame, the particle doesn't move, but the decay length is zero. So, in the lab frame, the decay length is L = gamma v tau0.

Wait, v is in terms of c, so L= gamma beta c tau0.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau0, which is L_avg.

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

I'm stuck. The options don't match my calculation. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum distance such that the probability of decay within that distance is 30%. I've computed that as 0.67e-6 m, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I have made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact gamma value.

Gamma is 27 /3.41 =7.918.

Compute beta gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 ) = sqrt(1 -0.01595) = sqrt(0.98405)=0.99202.

So, beta gamma is0.99202 *7.918 =7.854.

So, L_avg =7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7.

7.854 *2.4e-7 = 18.8496e-7 =1.88496e-6 m.

Hmm, again same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the average decay length but about the minimum distance to capture 30% of the decays, which would require a larger L_res. Let's think: If L_res is 2.08e-6 m, what's the probability?

Compute P=1−exp(−2.08e-6/1.885e-6)=1−exp(−1.103).

exp(−1.103)≈0.332 → P=1−0.332=0.668.

So, about 66.8% of decays would be observed with a resolution of 2.08e-6 m. But the question asks for 30%, which would require a much lower L_res.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Let me think: Perhaps the decay length is L = c tau gamma.

Wait, tau is gamma tau0.

So, L =c tau gamma → no, that would be c *gamma tau0 *gamma → which would be c gamma^2 tau0.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the time in the lab frame is tau =gamma tau0. So, the distance is v * tau =beta c gamma tau0.

Which is the same as beta gamma c tau0, so L_avg.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact formula:

L = v * tau → tau is gamma tau0.

v = beta c.

So, L = beta c gamma tau0.

Which is beta gamma c tau0.

Which is same as before.

I think the only conclusion is that the correct answer is approximately 0.67e-6 m, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta gamma.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in using the energy equation. Let me double-check.

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) /c ?

Wait, no, E is in GeV, but when using units correctly:

E (GeV) = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

So, (p c) = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) → in GeV.

So, p c = sqrt(27² -3.41² ) = sqrt(729-11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.785 GeV.

So, p =26.785 GeV/c.

Then, beta = (p c ) / E → 26.785 /27 =0.992037.

So, I think that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Perhaps the problem is considering the lifetime in the lab frame and then the distance.

The lifetime in lab frame is tau = gamma tau0.

The distance the particle travels is v tau = beta c gamma tau0.

Which is same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the velocity as (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2) / E, which is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the average speed as c, which is an approximation, leading to a longer distance.

If v is approximated as c, then L_avg = c gamma tau0.

Gamma is 7.918, tau0=8e-16.

So,

L_avg =3e8 m/s *7.918 *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

2.4e-7 *7.918 =1.899e-6 m.

Which is about 1.9e-6 m.

But again, the options have A as 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2.08e-6 m and see what gamma that would correspond to.

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is option A. Let's see what fraction of the average decay length that is.

2.08e-6 /1.885e-6 ≈1.098.

So, 2.08e-6 m is approximately 1.098 times the average decay length.

So, if the minimum resolution is the average decay length, then the probability P would be:

P=1−exp(−L_res / L_avg) =1−exp(−1.098) ≈1−0.333 =0.667.

So, about 66.7% of decays would be observed. But the question asks for 30% → which is much lower.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the minimum distance as the average decay length multiplied by the natural logarithm of (1/(1-0.3)) → ln(1/0.7)=0.3567.

So, 1.885e-6 *0.3567≈0.672e-6 m.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is intended to compute the minimum distance as the average decay length multiplied by (1-P), which would be (1-0.3)=0.7.

Wait, 1.885e-6 *0.7 =1.3195e-6 m.

No, that's still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the decay length as L=gamma beta c tau0 * (ln(1/(1-0.3))).

So, L=gamma beta c tau0 *0.35667.

Which is same as L_avg *0.35667 → same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation is correct, and the intended answer is option A (2.08e-6 m), but I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternative approach: Compute the average decay length.

Gamma = E/(m c²) =27 /3.41 =7.918.

beta= sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 )=sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )=sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )≈0.992037.

L_avg = beta gamma c tau0.

So,

beta gamma =0.992037 *7.918 ≈7.854.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So,

L_avg=7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7.

Multiply by7.854 →7.854 *2.4e-7 =18.8496e-7 =1.88496e-6 m.

So, 1.885e-6 m.

Hmm.

Wait, the options have 2.08e-6 m as option A.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds, but I used 8e-16. Let me double-check.

The problem states: tau0=8×10^−16 s. Yes.

Hmm. Without any other leads, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should use the mass in GeV/c² correctly. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in units. The mass is given in GeV, but perhaps I should use GeV/c². So, m c² is correctly 3.41 GeV.

So, perhaps no mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should use E = K + m c², but that's not the case because E is given as the total energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as (E² - (m c²)^2 )^(1/2) / E, which is correct, but perhaps I should recompute.

(E² - (m c²)^2 ) = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 =729 -11.6281=717.3719.

So, sqrt(717.3719)=26.785 GeV.

So, beta =26.785 /27 =0.992037.

So, correct.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should select the closest option, which is A) 2.08e-6 m, even though my calculation gives 1.88e-6 m. But perhaps I messed up the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma =27 /3.41 → 27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7 =23.87, 27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 ≈0.917.

So, gamma=7.917.

Beta= sqrt(1−(3.41/27)^2 )=sqrt(1−(0.1263)^2 )=sqrt(1−0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.99202.

So, beta gamma=0.99202 *7.917→ compute more accurately.

Compute 7.917 *0.99202.

7 *0.99202=6.94414.

0.917 *0.99202 ≈0.917*(1-0.00798)=0.917 -0.917*0.00798 ≈0.917 -0.00733=0.90967.

So, total beta gamma≈6.94414+0.90967=7.8538.

So, beta gamma=7.8538.

So,

L_avg=7.8538 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

7.8538 *2.4e-7 → let's compute 7 *2.4=16.8, 0.8538*2.4=2.0491.

So 16.8+2.0491=18.8491e-7 m=1.88491e-6 m.

So, same as before.

Hmm. Unless the problem uses a different approach, perhaps using the velocity as (pc)/E, which is correct.

I think I have to conclude that none of the options match, but perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is using the speed as c, not beta c.

If I use v=c, then L_avg =7.918 *3e8 *8e-16=7.918 *24e-8 →7.918 *2.4e-7=1.9e-6 m.

Which is 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A's 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using v=c as an approximation, leading to L_avg=1.9e-6 m.

But then, the minimum L_res to capture 30% would be 0.3567 *1.9e-6=0.678e-6 m, which is still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed as (E/m)^0.5, which is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the velocity as (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2)/ m c².

Which is same as beta c, so same as before.

I'm stuck. I think I have to proceed with the calculation as I did, and perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest is option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process of the particle \( X^0 \) with a proper lifetime \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \). The particle's energy is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The goal is to calculate the minimum spatial resolution required to detect 30% of the decays.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Relativistic Parameters**:
   - The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.918
     \]
   - The velocity \( \beta \) is derived from:
     \[
     \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.918^2}} \approx 0.992
     \]

2. **Average Decay Length**:
   - The average decay length \( L_{\text{avg}} \) is given by:
     \[
     L_{\text{avg}} = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
     \]
   - Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.992 \), \( \gamma \approx 7.918 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
     \[
     L_{\text{avg}} = 0.992 \cdot 7.918 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
     \]

3. **Minimum Resolution**:
   - To observe at least 30% of the decays, the minimum resolution \( L_{\text{res}} \) is determined using the cumulative distribution function for exponential decay:
     \[
     P = 1 - e^{-L_{\text{res}} / L_{\text{avg}}}
     \]
     Setting \( P = 0.3 \), we solve:
     \[
     L_{\text{res}} = L_{\text{avg}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - P}\right) = L_{\text{avg}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.7}\right) \approx L_{\text{avg}} \cdot 0.35667
     \]
   - Substituting \( L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
     \[
     L_{\text{res}} \approx 0.35667 \cdot 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \approx 0.672 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated \( L_{\text{res}} \approx 0.672 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - The closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, which is approximately 30% larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided options and the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, as it aligns most closely with the expected resolution based on the calculations.

Answer: A
