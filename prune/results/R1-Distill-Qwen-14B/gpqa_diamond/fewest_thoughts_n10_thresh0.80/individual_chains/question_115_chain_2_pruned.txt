Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to think through it step by step. Hmm. Let me see. The problem involves an electron and a positron moving towards each other, colliding, and producing two photons. The question is about the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Wait, let me get the details right. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Oh right, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they usually produce photons. Since the electron and positron are moving along the same line, but opposite directions, their annihilations must conserve both momentum and energy. Also, since the photons have the same energy, that should help in calculations.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The electron has gamma 4, and the positron gamma 2. So, I think I need to calculate their relativistic momenta and energies.

The Lorentz factor gamma is defined as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe it's easier to think in terms of momentum and energy using gamma. For a particle, the total energy is gamma * m * c², and the momentum is gamma * m * v.

Wait, but for a positron, which is an antiparticle, but since it's moving opposite to the electron, their momenta would be in opposite directions. So, when they collide, the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta. Since they're moving along the same line, the directions matter.

Let me think about their momenta. For the electron: moving left to right (since it's moving from left with gamma 4). The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is leftwards.

Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So, let's say the electron is moving in the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so it's moving in the negative x-direction.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If an electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, it's moving to the right (
