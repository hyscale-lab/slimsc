Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator, which makes sense because σz is the Pauli z-matrix, and its eigenstates are those spin-up and spin-down states.

The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh right, expectation values. I think the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket of the state with the operator acting on the state. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

Wait, but since expectation values are linear, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make it easier. So first, I'll find ⟨σz⟩ and then ⟨σx⟩.

But wait, what's σz and σx? Oh right, σz is the Pauli z matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Similarly, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which I'll need to express in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Oh, right, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], which means it flips the spin states.

The given state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this more clearly. So ψ is a linear combination: a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2. Because in the spin state, it's usually written as a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, right? And I should check whether this state is normalized. Let's see, |a|² + |b|² = (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good, no need to normalize it.

First, compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is just |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1). Because when you measure σz on |↑⟩, you get +1, and on |↓⟩, you get -1.

So |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and |b|² is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Next, ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier. I know that σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value directly using the
