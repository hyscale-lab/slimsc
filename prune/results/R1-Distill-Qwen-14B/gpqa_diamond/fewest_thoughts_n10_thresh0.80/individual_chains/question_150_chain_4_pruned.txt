Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's an important starting point. The NMR data is provided, which should help in determining the structure. Then, the compound undergoes a series of reactions with specific reagents, and I need to find out what the final product is from the given options.

First, let's break down the NMR data. The 1H-NMR spectrum shows the following signals:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

I remember that proton NMR peaks can tell us about the neighboring groups and the structure around them. Let's analyze each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so it's probably an aldehyde proton (RCHO). The triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons usually are deshielded and appear as singlets because they don't have neighboring protons. Unless it's part of an enal or conjugated system where the aldehyde is next to a double bond. Oh wait, if the aldehyde is adjacent to a double bond, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, the aldehyde proton might couple with the neighboring doublet. Hmm, but in that case, maybe it's a triplet because it's coupling with two protons. Wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with substituents. No, wait, aromatic protons are usually lower, around 7 ppm, but this is higher. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like an enol or something else. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups? Or maybe an aldehyde.

The next peak is at 6.98 ppm, a doublet of 2H. That sounds like a pair of equivalent protons in an aromatic ring, perhaps para-substituted. Like two protons on a benzene ring that's para-substituted. So maybe a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Similarly, 6.51 ppm is another doublet for 2H. That might be another set of aromatic protons, possibly in a different ring or part of the same ring. Wait, but 6.98 and 6.51 are close but not identical, so maybe two different substituents on the same ring? Or perhaps they're part of two different rings.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlets can sometimes indicate exchange, like -OH protons, but in this case, it's 2H. Or maybe it's part of an enol or a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituents that cause the protons to be more deshielded. Wait, but broad singlets are tricky. Another thought: maybe it's the protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diol or something. Or perhaps it's a double bond with adjacent substituents. Hmm.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet integrating for 2H. That's a bit upfield for a CH2 group. Maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps part of an ether or ester. Wait, the doublet suggests that each of these two protons is adjacent to another set of protons. So maybe it's a CH2 next to another CH2 group, or perhaps next to a CH that's part of a double bond.

Now, putting
