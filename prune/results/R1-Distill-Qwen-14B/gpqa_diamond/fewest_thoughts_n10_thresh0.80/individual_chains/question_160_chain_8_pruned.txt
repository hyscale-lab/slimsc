Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm, let's try to understand what's being asked.

The question says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, which is light of a single wavelength λ, is falling vertically along the z-axis. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field, which I think refers to the diffraction pattern.

Wait, the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, right, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So for an infinitely large N, the aperture is a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius. So in this case, the radius 'r' of the circular aperture is 'a'?

But wait, in the context of a polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. So when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem. So the radius of the circle is 'a'.

So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. Oh right, the single-slit diffraction pattern.

In single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at angles θ where a sinθ = m λ, with m being the order (m = ±1, ±2, ...). The first minima are at m=1 and m=-1. But wait, the angular distance between the first two minima would be the angle between m=1 and m=-1? No, wait, the first minima on either side of the central maximum. So the first minima are at θ = λ/(a), but wait, no, because in the case of a circular aperture, the first minimum is given by sinθ ≈ θ = λ/(π a), because for a circular aperture, the condition is a bit different.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. For a single-slit (rectangular), the minima are at a sinθ = mλ. The first minima are at
