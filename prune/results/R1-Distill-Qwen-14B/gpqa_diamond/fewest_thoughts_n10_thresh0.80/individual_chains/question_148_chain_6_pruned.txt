Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds known. So, element Y forms five different compounds where fluorine is the other element.

The first part talks about a bright-red substance A1. It decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, wait, oF is the oxidation state of fluorine, I think. So in A2, fluorine has an oxidation state of 31.96%... Wait, no, oxidation states are usually integers, like +1, -1, etc. Oh, wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, no. oF probably stands for the oxygen-free (or maybe something else?) state, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it refers to the percentage of fluorine by mass. Oh, right, sometimes in compounds, the percentage composition is given. So, for A2, the fluorine content is 31.96% by mass.

So when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and fluorine gas. So A1 → A2 + F2. Since fluorine is a diatomic molecule, that makes sense.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Common oxidizing agents with fluorine include things like F2 itself, or maybe something like ClF3 or other fluorine compounds. But wait, A1 is itself a fluorine compound, so perhaps it's a fluorine-containing oxidizing agent.

Then, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y. So Y reacts with F2 to form A3. So Y and F combine to make A3.

Next, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. So A4 + Y → A5. The solution is colorless and concentrated, which might suggest something like H2SO4 or maybe another acid. But since it's related to fluorine compounds, perhaps it's H2F2? Wait, hydrogen fluoride is a weak acid, but concentrated solutions can be different. Alternatively, maybe it's a solution of a fluoride salt.

When A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. So A5 is probably something that reacts with water. For example, perhaps a fluoride salt or a compound that hydrolyzes.

The question is to find the molecular weight range of A4. The options are A) 140-160, B)220-2
