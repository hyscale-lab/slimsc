Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I recall is around where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids) show up. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, compound X probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, maybe a carboxylic acid.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down:

1. 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's pretty high. Carboxylic acid protons usually show up around 10-12 ppm as broad signals because they're exchangeable. So this might be the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid.

2. 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe a para-substituted benzene. The two protons are equivalent, so they're probably in a symmetrical position, like para to each other.

3. 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another aromatic doublet, but a bit downfield. So perhaps the protons adjacent to substituents are this. Wait, but if the first doublet is at 8.0, this could be the other set of para protons on the ring. Wait, no, wait. For a para-substituted benzene, if there's an electron-withdrawing group, the protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. So maybe the ring has two substituents, like a carboxylic acid group and another group, or perhaps it's a meta situation?

Wait, but the other peaks might help. Let's look at the others.

4. 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative group. Like a CH next to a carbonyl. Or maybe part of a CH2 group.

5. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, possibly two protons, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something. Like in an ethyl chain or a substituent.

6. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for three hydrogens. That could be a methyl group attached to a CH or something. Like a CH(CH3) group, perhaps in a substituent.

7. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe CH2CH3.

Putting this together. So the aromatic signals suggest a para-substituted benzene. Let's think about the substituents. The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid group attached to the ring. So the structure might be benzoic acid, but with substituents.

Wait, the NMR also has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) which is probably a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene is -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 or something like that? Or maybe a butyl group?

Wait, let's consider the splitting. The triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests it's attached to a CH2 group. So that CH2 is connected to another CH2, which is connected to another group. Hmm.

Looking at the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), possibly a methine (CH) group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. And the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH. So maybe the substituent on the benzene is a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) or some kind of branching.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group? Or perhaps a branch like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let me think: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, so that's a methyl group attached to a CH. So the structure could be -CH(CH3)(something). The 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH, and
