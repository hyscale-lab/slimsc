Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, Compound X has certain IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The goal is to find the final product from the options given.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The other peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents, perhaps a benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but also, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12, but it's usually a broad peak. Hmm, but since it's a singlet and broad, maybe an -OH group, but in an acid, the OH is usually a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a phenolic OH, but that would usually be broader and maybe not as sharp. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. Esters are around 1740. An acid could be around 1700. Wait, but the IR shows 1720, which could be an ester or an acid. Let me think: Carboxylic acids have O-H in IR around 2500-3300 (broad), which is present here. The 1720 is perhaps a bit high for a carboxylic acid, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

But wait, the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm. Carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So perhaps this is a carboxylic acid. But another possibility is a ketone or aldehyde. Aldehydes are around 9-10, but they're usually sharp. The 10.5 is a bit higher, but maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, with two doublets. So maybe a benzene ring with two substituents at the para positions, each with two protons each. So perhaps a substituent on the benzene ring that's causing the two doublets. For example, if it's a para-substituted benzene with two identical groups, like two methyl groups, but wait, no, that would produce two singlets. Alternatively, substituents which cause splitting. Oh wait, if the substituents are such that the ring has two sets of protons, like in para-xylene, but that would give singlets. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where each substituent has protons that are split into doublets. Hmm, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with two different substituents, but each causing the neighboring protons to split.

Alternatively, think about an ortho, meta, or para-substituted benzene. Wait, the two doublets each integrating to 2H suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each split into a doublet. So, perhaps the substituents are in the para position. For example, if it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each substituent causing the adjacent protons to be a doublet.

Wait, wait, another possibility: The substituents are such that the ring is meta, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, such as a benzoyl group. Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester.

Looking at the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So, each is a doublet. Let's think about a para-substituted benzene where the substituent is a group that deshields the protons. For example, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a para-substituted benzoyl group. So, if the substituent is an aryl group with a carbonyl group, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that has an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. So, the substituent could be a ketone group, which would cause the adjacent protons to be deshielded and split into doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, if the substituent is a propionyl group (CH2CO-) attached at the para position, that would give a benzene ring with two sets of protons. Each set (ortho and meta to the substituent) would be split into doublets. That might fit the NMR data.

So, putting that together, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent like a ketone or an ester group. Let me think about the other NMR peaks.

Looking at the other signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet, suggesting perhaps a CH group that's adjacent to other CH2 groups. Maybe a CH connected to a carbonyl group, like a CH2CO structure. Or perhaps it's an isopropyl group or something similar.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH, like part of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, maybe a CH(CH3)2 group or a CH2CH(CH3) group. Wait, no, a doublet (d) for 3H. So, perhaps a CH3 group attached to a CH. Like in an isopropyl group: the CH3 groups attached to a central CH would give a triplet, but wait, in isopropyl, the CH is split into a septet, but that's in a different context. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3 group attached to a CH that's next to another CH2, maybe. Or maybe it's a geminal di-substitution.

Wait, 1.4 ppm as a doublet (d) for 3H. That's characteristic of a methyl group attached to a CH, such as in an isopropyl group. For example, in an isopropyl group, the CH is connected to two CH3 groups. The CH3 would be split into a doublet, I think. Or maybe not—wait, in isopropyl, the CH is split by the adjacent CH2. No, wait, no: in isopropyl groups, the CH is between two CH3 groups. So the CH3 groups would be next to the CH, so their splitting would depend on coupling. Alternatively, maybe the 1.4 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet due to coupling with another CH2 group.

Hmm. Let me try to sketch a possible structure. So, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. The substituent could be a carbonyl group attached to a chain. For example, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent like RCO- where R is an alkyl chain.

Wait, combining the IR and NMR data: the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So, it's likely a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid.

If the compound has a carbonyl, then perhaps it's a benzoyl group attached to some chain. Let me think: the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would be the -COOH proton. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but the integration is 1H. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton would be sharp. But in this case, it's a broad singlet, so maybe it's an -OH group, like an alcohol or a phenol. Wait, but the IR also shows a peak around 2500-3400, which is consistent with O-H stretching. So, perhaps it's an -OH group.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl from an ester or a ketone. Let me think: if it's a benzophenone (a ketone), then the carbonyl peak would be around 1700 cm-1. So 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows 10.5 ppm (
