Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the energy levels of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that we have four identical particles in a 1D infinite well of length L. Each particle has spin-1/2, which means they can be either spin up or spin down. Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents them from all having the same quantum state.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by the formula E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number (n=1,2,3,...). The problem states that E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

Since the particles are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Because they are in a one-dimensional system and considering only spatial and spin parts, the overall wavefunction is the product of the spatial part and the spin part. The spin part can be symmetric or antisymmetric, so the spatial part must compensate to make the overall wavefunction antisymmetric.

Wait, but for indistinguishable particles, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin. So in a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by its n value and spin. Since we have two possible spin states (up and down), each n level can hold two particles.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, maximum two particles can be placed.

Now, the question is about four particles. Let's figure out how they fill the energy levels.

The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. Since each energy level can hold two particles, the first level (n=1) will have two particles, each with opposite spins. Then the next level (n=2) will also have two particles, again each with opposite spins. So in the ground state, the four particles fill the n=1 and n=2 levels.

So the total energy for the ground state would be the sum of each particle's energy. Since each n=1 has two particles, each contributing E=1²E= E. So two particles contribute 2E. Similarly, two particles in n=2 contribute 2*(4E) =8E. So the total energy is 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think of the system as each particle having a particular n and spin. So the total energy is the sum of each individual's energy. So the two n=1 particles contribute 2E, and the two n=2 contribute 2*(4E)=8E, so total E_ground = 10E.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe each particle is in a specific state, so two in n=1 and two in n=2. So sum is (1² +
