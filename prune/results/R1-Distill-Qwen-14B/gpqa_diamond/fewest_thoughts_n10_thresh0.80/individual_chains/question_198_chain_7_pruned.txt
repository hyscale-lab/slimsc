Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves cobalt ions and thiocyanate. Oh right, I remember that when metals form complexes with ligands, their stability is determined by these beta constants, which are the stability constants for each step of complexation.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and SCN- (thiocyanate) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually refer to the formation of complexes step by step. So β1 would be for Co(SCN)1^2+, β2 for Co(SCN)2^2+, and so on up to β4.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Oh wait, blue usually refers to the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion, but wait, the problem is about thiocyanate complexes. Oh, wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, thiocyanate complexes can have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)]^2+ is a different color than [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. But the problem specifically mentions 'dithiocyanato' which I think means two SCN ligands. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+.

Wait, wait. Let's get the details right. The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the color. Maybe the blue one is a certain complex, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or maybe the hexa-aqua is blue and the thiocyanate complexes are different. Wait, no, the question is about the dithiocyanato complexes, so I should focus on that.

The main idea is that the cobalt can form complexes with varying numbers of SCN- ligands, and we need to find the fraction of the Co that is in the form of the second complex (n=2), which I think is the dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, the stability constants are β1, β2, etc. Let me think. The stability constant, β, for each complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex. So, for the first complex, it's [Co(SCN)]^2+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

Similarly, β2 is the equilibrium constant for the second complex: [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 [Co(SCN)]^2+ [SCN^-]

Wait, no. Oh wait, stability constants are cumulative. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, β2 is for the second, and so on. So the overall formation for each step is multiplied.

Wait no, I think each β is the stepwise formation constant. So, for Co^2+ and SCN^-:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^2+ ; β1 = 9

Co(SCN)^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SC
