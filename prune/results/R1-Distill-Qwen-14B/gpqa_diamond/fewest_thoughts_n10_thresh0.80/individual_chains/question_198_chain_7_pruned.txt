Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

The question says: There's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us about the stability of metal-ligand complexes. A higher β means a more stable complex. The problem gives four β values, which probably correspond to different complexes, like [Co(SCN)]^n+ with n=1, 2, 3, 4.

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato complexes. Oh, wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So which β corresponds to the [Co(SCN)₂]^n+ complex? Let me think. The β values are β1, β2, β3, β4. So likely, β1 is the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]+, β2 is [Co(SCN)₂]^+, β3 [Co(SCN)3]^−, β4 [Co(SCN)4]^3−? Or maybe the charges are different. Not sure, but perhaps the order is that each βn corresponds to the complex with n SCN ligands.

Wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that's the [Co(SCN)₂]^− complex, which is blue. So the stability constant β2 is given as 40. Wait, no, wait. Because β1 is 9, β2 40, β3 63, β4 16. So if β increases up to β3 and then drops, that's interesting. So the most stable complex is β3=63, which is [Co(SCN)3]^- I think.

But the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato (two SCN) complexes. So that's the species with two
