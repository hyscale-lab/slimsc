Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me try to work through this.

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with different expressions.

Alright, let's start by recalling some concepts. Potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. For a system of charges, the potential energy is the work required to assemble those charges from infinity.

In this case, we have a single charge q placed near a conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to the Earth, so any induced charges on the sphere can flow to or from the ground. Since it's a conductor, the charges will redistribute themselves on the surface.

Wait, the sphere being grounded... so when the charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges. But because it's grounded, the sphere's potential is zero. So the charges on the sphere will adjust to ensure that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

But how does that affect the potential energy? Let me think. The potential energy of the system comes from the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

I remember that for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere can be treated as if they were a point charge located at the center. So, the sphere effectively behaves like a point charge of the same magnitude as q but opposite sign, right? Or wait, maybe that's when the sphere is ungrounded. If it's grounded, then the induced charge might be different.

Wait, no. Wait, when a charge is outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges are such that the external charge induces an opposite charge on the near side and a same charge on the far side. But if the sphere is grounded, the excess charge can leave, so the sphere's net charge would be determined by the external charge and the grounding.

Wait, maybe I should think about image charges. For a conducting sphere, the method of images says that a charge q outside the sphere induces an image charge -q inside the sphere (but since the sphere is conducting, the image is inside). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, when the sphere is grounded, the image charge concept might change because
