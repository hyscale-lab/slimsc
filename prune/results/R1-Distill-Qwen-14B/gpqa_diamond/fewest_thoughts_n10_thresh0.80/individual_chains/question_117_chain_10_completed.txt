Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds show optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, right? So stereoisomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula and same connectivity but differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space. Optical isomerism specifically refers to compounds that have chiral centers, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers would rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, hence the term optical isomers.

So the question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit this. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions. I think biphenyl compounds can have what's called geometric isomerism if there's a substituent on each ring, but does that lead to optical isomerism? Oh wait, no, geometric isomerism is about the arrangement around a double bond or in a ring, not about chirality. But wait, maybe in this case, the substituents create a situation where there's a chiral center. Let me think. The central part is the biphenyl. The substituents are in positions 2 and 2' on each ring. Are there any chiral centers here? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself isn't chiral, but the substituents create a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, the substituents are ester groups (O-CO-O) and nitro groups. Hmm, no, I don't think there's a chiral center here. Because each substituent is symmetrical. For example, each ring has a nitro group in 6 and a carboxylate in 2. So perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. So maybe this compound doesn't have optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, so its methyl ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy is on the middle carbon. So the ester would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that structure would have the hydroxyl on the central carbon, which is connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, the central carbon is CH(OH) connected to two CH2 groups and a COOCH3. So the central carbon has four different groups: OH, CH2CH2, COOCH3, and the other CH2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, and another CH3 (from the adjacent CH2?) Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be the middle carbon of propane. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be because propane is three carbons. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to: another CH3, a COOCH3 group, an OH, and another CH3 from the adjacent carbon? Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is CH2. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: OH attached, so it's CH(OH)

Carbon 3: CH3

So structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? But that would mean the second carbon is CH2, but where is the OH? Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3? No, that's not possible because propane has three carbons. So number them: 1, 2, 3. So propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the second carbon is CH(OH), and the first and third are CH2 and COOCH3. Wait, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, which would have two CH2 groups adjacent? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3? No, that would have the same groups on two sides. Wait, in that case, the central carbon is attached to:

- One CH3 group (from carbon 1)
- One OH group
- One COOCH3 group (from carbon 3)
- And another CH2 (carbon 2? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the central carbon being bonded to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2 group. Wait, no, the central carbon is the second in the chain. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2. But wait, that would have two H's, so no chiral center. So how can that be?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider whether this molecule has a chiral center. The central carbon (number 2) would have:

- Two CH2 groups (from the adjacent carbons)
- An OH
- A CH2 connected to the COOCH3?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now, carbon 2 has four different groups: CH3 (from C1), COOCH3 (from C3), OH, and another H? Wait, no, because CH(OH) has two Hs. If the central carbon (C2) is CH(OH), then its groups would be:

- One CH3 (from C1)
- One COOCH3 (from C3)
- One OH
- And two H's.

Wait, no, if it's CH(OH), then the number of substituents is CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2? Or perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the actual structure.

Wait, another approach: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, and the ester would have the structure HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in that structure, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to two CH2 groups. So, the groups attached are: two CH2's, an OH, and a COOCH3. So, wait, the central carbon would have two CH2 groups, which are same. So, the groups would be: CH2CH2, CH2COOCH3, OH, and another CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

In that case, the central carbon (C2) has four groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a CH2 group? Wait, no. C2 is connected to:

- C1: CH3
- C3: COOCH3
- OH
- And another CH2? Or is it attached to two CH3 groups? No, because the chain is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central C (C2) is attached to:

- CH3 (from C1)
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- OH
- And another H. Wait, so that's four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, the four groups are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Are all four different? Yes. So, that's a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center, meaning it can have optical isomers. So option 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. Does this have any chiral centers? Well, the central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded. So no, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, thus no optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which is a dihydroxy compound. Wait, fumaric acid is an isomer of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate would be with two double bonds. Wait, fumarate is the trans diastereomer of maleate. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-? Wait, no, fumarate itself is the trans (E) isomer. So dimethyl fumarate is CH2CH2COOCH3 with the double bond in the trans configuration. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, and when esterified, it becomes CH2CH2COOCH3, but with the double bond in the trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester.

In terms of optical isomerism, does this compound have any chiral centers? Let me think. The structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, no, wait: dimethyl fumarate is CH2CH2COOCH3 with a double bond. Wait, no, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, I think fumaric acid has a double bond: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3? No, perhaps more accurately, it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 and the same on the other side? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of fumaric acid is trans-dihydroxy. Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH2COOCH3? No, no, the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, no, wait. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
CH2-CH2
   |
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 on each end. So, the central double bond is between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, more accurately, the two carbonyl groups are on each end of the double bond. So the molecule is O=C-OCH3 connected via a double bond to another O=C-OCH3, with two CH2 groups in between? No, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, perhaps it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. No, that would imply a single bond. Alternatively, the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, that's not right. I think I'm getting stuck, but the key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. If the molecule has a double bond, but no chiral centers, then it won't have optical isomerism. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, right? So in that structure, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But the molecule itself isn't chiral because it's symmetrical. So, does it have any chiral centers? No, because the carbonyl carbons are double-bonded and the other carbons are attached to two methyl groups. Wait, perhaps the central carbons (the ones attached to the double bond) each have two methyl ester groups and two double-bonded oxygens. So, no chiral centers. So, does this mean dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism? Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the molecule is symmetrical, maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because of the arrangement around the double bond. Wait, no, a trans double bond doesn't create a chiral center. Chiral centers require four different substituents on a carbon. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, wait. Another thought: when you have diastereomers, like cis and trans, those are different from enantiomers. But optical isomerism refers to enantiomers, which require chiral centers. So if dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, then it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not so confident about that. Let me think again. Suppose the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=CH- COOCH3 on each end. No, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible because that would imply a single bond. Maybe I should think of it as (E)-CH2-COOCH3 connected via a double bond to another CH2-COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3, but that can't be right because that would require a five-carbon chain. I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps the main point is that dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers because the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, there's no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm now remembering that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, and dimethyl fumarate has a trans double bond. Wait, but without any chiral centers, it can't have enantiomers, so no optical activity. So perhaps option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: some compounds without chiral centers can show optical isomerism due to the presence of an axial chirality, like in allenes or certain bridged structures. But in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical, so any symmetry would prevent it from being chiral. So I don't think dimethyl fumarate can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think of another approach. Which of the options have chiral centers?

Option 1: No chiral centers, as the substituents are symmetric.

Option 2: Yes, a chiral center exists, so optical isomerism.

Option 3: No chiral centers.

Option 4: No chiral centers.

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 has a chiral center. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about option 4.

Dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 on both ends, connected via a double bond. So the molecule is O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, no, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, each of the carboxylic acid groups becomes a COOCH3 group. So the structure would be O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So the actual structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, but that would imply a four-carbon chain, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should imagine the structure as:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2-CH2 - CO-OCH3
Wait, no, because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. But that would imply that each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group, but the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. That can't be right because that would require a central CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2-CH2
   || 
O   O
C-OCH3

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the key point is that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because the central carbons are each bonded to two identical groups. For example, each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, no, no chiral centers. Therefore, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me go back to the options and see which ones definitely have optical isomerism.

From our analysis, option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Now, checking the options:

Options given are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but I thought option 4 doesn't. So the correct options showing optical isomerism are option 2.

Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Structure is (E)-CH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, no. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diester with a double bond. So the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, that would be a central C connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. No, that can't be because each carbon in the double bond can have only three substituents. So perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible because that would create a three-membered ring structure, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should think about whether this molecule has any chiral centers. If it doesn't, then option 4 is not correct.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is a trans-diesters. Wait, no, it's the trans isomer. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But without any chiral centers, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, from the four options, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options given:

Looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2, 4 → I think 1 and 4 don't, so no.

B) 3 and 4 → No, 3 and 4 don't.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 doesn't, so no.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 doesn't, so no.

Wait, but I've got only option 2 as correct. But the options don't include an option that only includes 2. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me reevaluate option 4.

Dimethyl fumarate: chemical structure is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is O=C-OCH3 connected via a double bond to another O=C-OCH3, but arranged in the trans configuration. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be because that would require the double bond to be between two CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. So each of the carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So each of these carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group. Wait, but that would mean each carbon in the double bond has the same groups, making them identical. So no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Some other possibility: does the molecule have any other chiral centers? For example, perhaps one of the ester groups is attached in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. No, I don't think so. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus no optical isomerism.

So, then, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking back at the options given:

The options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, none of the options have only 2 as correct. Which means I must have made an error in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate option 4. Maybe I was wrong, and option 4 does have a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-COOCH2COOCH3. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the two ester groups are on the same side (for fumarate, which is the trans isomer). Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the ester groups are on opposite sides.

Wait, maybe I should think of the molecule as two ester groups on each end of a double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So, it's symmetric, hence no chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, in that case, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in another option.

Wait, let's go back to option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond), with substituents at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6' on each ring.

So, the substituents are at 2 and 2', which are on the same ring as the connecting bond (1,1'). Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

Wait, but if both rings have the same substituents, then the molecule might be symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a ester at 2. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

But wait, biphenyl rings can have what's called "meso" forms if there's a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps the molecule is achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options: So, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center I didn't notice. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. On esterification with methanol, both -COOH groups become -COOCH3. So the structure becomes CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. Wait, no, that would imply a four-carbon chain with double bond and two ester groups. So the structure is O
|
O-C-OCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected by a double bond to another O=C-OCH3. But that would require the structure to be O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, which isn't correct because that would be a single bond.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. That would make sense. So the double bond is between the two central carbons, each connected to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, it's (E)-CH2-COOCH3-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's a single bond. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-COOCH2COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2. But that would require a central carbon attached to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond, which would make it a chiral center. Wait, if that's the case, then the central carbon (the one attached to two ester groups and a double bond) would have four different groups: two ester groups, a CH2, and the double bond. Wait, no, the double bond is between two carbons. So, perhaps the central carbon (the one in the middle of the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups, a CH2, and the other CH.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck here. Another approach: perhaps I should recall that dimethyl fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid, which has a trans double bond. Does that diastereomerism lead to any possibility of optical isomerism? Or is it that the molecule is achiral because of symmetry?

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. For dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Then, only option 2 is correct. But in the options, none of the options have only 2 as correct. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of option 4.

Wait, perhaps I should look up if dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. From what I remember, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because the double bond is trans and the molecule is symmetrical. Thus, it's not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option is 2. But looking at the options, option A includes 2, but also 1 and 4, which I don't think are correct. Option D includes 1 and 2. But I think 1 doesn't have any optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1. Let me think again about option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond at positions 1 and 1'). Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So, each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The question is whether this creates a chiral center.

Wait, no, because the biphenyl structure is such that each ring has identical substituents. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two rings, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option is option 2. But looking at the choices, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1,2). Since I don't think 1 and 4 are correct, perhaps the correct answer is option 2 only, but that's not an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another possibility. Maybe option 4 does have a chiral center. Let me try to imagine the structure again. If dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with the double bond, perhaps I'm mistaken. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-COOCH3-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2=CH-COOCH3, but that would be a mono-ester, not di. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but that's mono again. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck and should consider that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so only option 2 is correct. But none of the options have only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps option 4 has a chiral center. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon in the double bond (the one attached to the two COOCH3 groups) is connected to:

- Two COOCH3 groups
- One CH2 group
- And a double bond (which counts as a substituent? No, because it's a double bond, not a single substituent.)

Wait, no, because the double bond is between two carbons, so each carbon is connected to three groups. So, the central carbon (in the double bond) would have:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group
- And the double bond to another carbon.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each of those carbons would have:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- And double bond to the other carbon.

So, each of those carbons has two substituents, making them CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the possibility of a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't have a chiral center. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option is option 2. But since none of the options have only 2, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and some others, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate structure is (E)-CH2=CH-COOCH3? No, that's a mono-ester. Oh, no, wait: dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3. But that's a single bond, so it's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. That would be a trans configuration. So, the molecule would have two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let me look at the central CH=CH. Each CH would be connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. But without any four distinct substituents, they can't be chiral. So, no, no chiral centers.

Thus, I'm confident that only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4), option D (1,2), and option C (2,3). Since I think 1 and 4 don't, and 3 doesn't, then perhaps the correct answer is option 2 and 4, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate option 4 again. What if the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2-COOCH3-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond and not a double bond. So that's not correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has any stereogenic centers. For that, each carbon in the molecule must have four different substituents. Let me check each option.

Option 2: yes, chiral center at C2.

Option 4: no chiral centers.

Thus, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options again, none have only option 2. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think of option 4 as a trans-diesters, which might exhibit geometric isomerism (E/Z), but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about enantiomers, which requires chiral centers.

Thus, I think the only correct answer is option 2. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about option 1. Does it have any chiral centers?

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 2' (on each ring) and 6 and 6' (on each ring). So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

Now, looking at the biphenyl structure, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Those positions are meta to each other. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm confident that only option 2 is correct. But the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in option 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2=CH-COOCH3, but that's mono, not di. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and option 4 does have a chiral center. Let me think: if the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond, perhaps the central carbon (the one in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups, a CH2, and another group, making it a chiral center. But if the substituents are symmetric, it's not possible. So, perhaps the structure is such that each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2, making them identical on both sides. Thus, no chiral center.

Thus, I think the only correct option is option 2. Since none of the options have only 2, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking again at the options, option A is 1,2,4. So, perhaps I was wrong about option 4, and it does have optical isomerism. So, I'll have to think again.

Another approach: perhaps fumarate has a chiral center. So, let's imagine the structure as (E)-CH2=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's a mono-ester. So dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups. So perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2=CH-COOCH2COOCH3. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-CO-OCH3 in the trans configuration. So, each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, but that would make each CH have two identical substituents (CH2), so no chiral center. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to option 2 being the only correct one. But the options don't include that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and option 4 also has a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: if a molecule has two identical groups on a carbon, it can't be chiral. So, in option 4, if the carbons in the double bond each have two identical substituents, no chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct option is option 2. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should look for other possibilities. Perhaps the biphenyl in option 1 has a chiral center. Let me think: the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each substituent is in a symmetric position, making the molecule achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct option is option 2. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think: if dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer is only option 2, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A (includes 2 and 4), but I don't think 4 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The question gives four options, and the options are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, I think option 2 is correct. Now, looking for which options include 2:

Option A includes 2, 1, and 4.

Option D includes 2 and 1.

But I think 1 and 4 are incorrect. So, perhaps the correct answer is only 2, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of option 4. Let me think again.

Another way to determine if a compound has optical isomerism is to check if it has a chiral center. So, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

The structure is (E)-CH2=CH-COOCH3? No, that's mono. Alternatively, (E)-CH2=CH-CO-OCH2COOCH3? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. Now, the carbon in the double bond (the C with the COOCH3) is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- The double bond to another C.

Wait, that's three substituents, which can't form a chiral center. Thus, no chiral centers.

So, I'm confident that only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing another possibility. Let me think about option 3: benzophenone. Structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct option is option 2, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I think 4 doesn't. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with the analysis:

- Option 1: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

- Option 2: Yes, chiral center. Optical isomerism.

- Option 3: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

- Option 4: No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

Thus, only option 2 has optical isomerism. But none of the options include only option 2. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I think 1 and 4 are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think: perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Another approach: Maybe the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere, not on the double bond. For example, if the ester groups are arranged in such a way that another carbon becomes chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one of the carbons attached to the ester groups is a chiral center. But I can't see that.

Thus, I think the correct answer is that only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

In conclusion, after a lengthy and perhaps flawed analysis, the best answer I can come up with is that only option 2 is correct. However, since the options don't include that, I think I'm missing something and the correct answer must be option A (1,2,4), but I'm not certain.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option for the presence of chiral centers, which are necessary for optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has non-superimposable mirror images due to chirality.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'. The molecule is symmetric, with identical substituents on both rings, and has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **not chiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a **chiral center**, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and does not serve as a chiral center. The molecule is **not chiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-CO-OCH3 in the (E)-configuration. The carbons in the double bond are each bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3 and CH2), making them non-chiral. The molecule is **not chiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (option 2) has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. None of the other compounds (1, 3, or 4) have chiral centers and do not exhibit optical isomerism. However, none of the provided answer choices reflect this conclusion. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **A (1, 2, and 4)**, though there is no strong evidence to support optical isomerism in options 1 or 4.
