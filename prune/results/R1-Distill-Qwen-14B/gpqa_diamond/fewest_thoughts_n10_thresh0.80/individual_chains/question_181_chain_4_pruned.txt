Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this solar neutrino flux question. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves various fusion processes. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, the pp-III branchâ€”isn't that part of the proton-proton chain? Oh right, the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches. The pp-I branch produces deuterium by two protons fusing, then another proton fuses to make tritium, and so on. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, but I might be getting the details mixed up.

The pp-III branch involves reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos. I think the main neutrino production in the Sun comes from the decay of boron-8, which is a product of the pp chain. Oh wait, when the proton-proton chain fuses four protons into a helium-4 nucleus, one of the steps involves the emission of a neutrino. Right, and the neutrinos are produced during the beta decay steps in the chain.

If the pp-III branch stops, that probably affects the production of certain neutrinos. But wait, the question says the pp-III branch stops, but all other reactions remain. So, which neutrinos are affected?

I remember that the dominant neutrino from the Sun is the Beryllium-7 neutrino. Wait no, the main one is the boron-8 neutrino, right? Or maybe I'm confusing the sources. The pp chain produces boron-8, which then decays into carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. So the neutrinos from the pp chain are part of this.

Alternatively, the pp-III branch might be the part where three protons interact in a different way, possibly producing higher-energy neutrinos. Oh, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think: the pp-I branch is the regular proton-proton chain, producing deuterium. The pp-II and pp-III branches are variations, perhaps involving higher-order reactions, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach. The neutrinos emitted by the Sun have different energies based on the reactions that produce them. The pp-III branch probably emits higher-energy neutrinos compared to other branches. So, if the pp-III stops
