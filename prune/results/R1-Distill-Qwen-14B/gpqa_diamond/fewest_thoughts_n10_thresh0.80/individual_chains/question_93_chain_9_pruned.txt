Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let's see what I remember. The question is about a scientist who made a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran it on serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3.

Wait, wait. I remember that in qPCR, the calibration curve is used to quantify the amount of target nucleic acid. The efficiency being 100% means it's perfect, right? And R² of 1 means a perfect correlation, so the curve fits the data perfectly. The slope of the curve is important too—I think the slope is related to the efficiency. The formula I recall is Slope = -3.32 * log10(efficiency), but wait, if efficiency is 100%, that's 1. So log10(1) is 0. Hmm, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, the efficiency formula is efficiency = 10^(-1/slope). Oh wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Because when the efficiency is 100%, the slope should be around -3.32, right? Because 100% efficiency means each cycle doubles the DNA. So the calculation for the slope would be -3.32 because each ten-fold increase in DNA would require an increase of 3.32 in the Ct. So if the slope here is -3.3, that's close to the expected -3.32. So that makes sense.

Looking at his data, the Ct values go down as the concentration increases. So higher concentration means lower Ct, which is correct because more DNA reaches the threshold faster. But each concentration has three technical replicates, and their Ct values are pretty close. For example, at 100000 copies, the Cts are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The differences between them are about 0.3, which seems acceptable. Similarly, for the other concentrations, the Ct values are all within 0.3 of each other. So the technical replicates are consistent within each dilution.

The question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are A to D. Let me read them again.

A) qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples. That doesn't make sense because qPCR is used for quantification. Plus, the R² is perfect, so the method is working.

B) Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples. Hmm, but the Cts are showing a clear trend where higher concentrations have lower Ct. So the Ct does agree with the amount. Since the efficiency is 100%, the data should fit perfectly, which they are doing as per R²=1.

C) Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, a ten-fold dilution should correspond to a change in Ct of about 3
