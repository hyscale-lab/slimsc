Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable P and getting the value 0. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with the corresponding eigenstate.

Wait, but wait. How do I approach this? Let me read the problem again carefully. The state of the system is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, the state vector is a 3x1 column vector, which I can write as |Ïˆ> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, I should check if this state is normalized. The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. Let's compute that: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector isn't normalized. Hmm, but when we calculate probabilities, I think we might need to normalize it first.

Wait, or am I getting this wrong? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector should have a norm of 1. So perhaps the given state isn't normalized, and I should normalize it before proceeding. Because otherwise, the probabilities might not add up to 1. So let me remember that step.

The observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that down:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Wait, let me double-check. The first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1
