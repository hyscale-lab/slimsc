Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a couple rings and double bonds. Let's see, maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) and then some double bonds or another ring. Or maybe a benzene and an aldehyde group.

Looking at the NMR data: The peaks are at 9.72 ppm (a triplet, 1H), 6.98 (doublet, 2H), 6.51 (doublet, 2H), 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H), and 3.66 (doublet, 2H). 

The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet. That's high up, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. But wait, aldehyde protons usually don't have neighboring Hs because they're at the end. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each with 2H. Those look like a pair of aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring, like a nitro group or something else. Wait, but the molecular formula has an N and O. Wait, the NMR doesn't show any exchange peaks, but maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents.

The 6.27 is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an aromatic protons that are part of an ortho or para-substituted ring, but the broadness might indicate some hydrogen exchange, like in a phenolic OH. Wait, but wait, the 6.27 is a singlet, so maybe it's a vinyl group or perhaps some other protons. Or maybe it's a diol or something where the protons are adjacent to an oxygen.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That's around the range for methylene groups adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. So perhaps an OCH2CH2 group or something similar. Doublet suggests coupling with adjacent protons. So maybe it's part of a chain.

Putting this together. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet, maybe a vinyl proton next to an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's an am
