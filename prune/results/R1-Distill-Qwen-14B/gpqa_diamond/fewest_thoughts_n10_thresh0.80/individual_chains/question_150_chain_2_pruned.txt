Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is given, and then it goes through a series of reactions. The final product needs to be identified from the options.

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data. The NMR peaks are as follows:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H

Wait, so what do these signals correspond to? Let's think.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm is usually indicative of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's probably the aldehyde group (CHO). 

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51. Those are doublets each integrating for two protons. Maybe two sets of aromatic protons. The 6.98 could be para-substituted aromatic protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually around 7 ppm. The 6.51 could be another set, maybe from another benzene ring or maybe from another substituent.

The 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an exchangeable proton, like an -OH group. But wait, it's integrating for two protons. Maybe it's a diol, or perhaps two -OH groups in a para position. Alternatively, could it be a double bond with adjacent protons, but the broadness makes me lean towards an -OH.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5.

Five degrees of unsaturation: that could be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond elsewhere. Or maybe a benzene and an enone structure.

Wait, the aldehyde is one part. Let me think about the structure. The aldehyde proton at 9.72 is a triplet, which suggests it's next to a CH2 group. Because a triplet implies coupling with two equivalent protons. So the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 that's next to another group.

Looking at the 3.66 ppm doublet, integrating for 2H. That's probably a CH2 connected to something electronegative. Maybe an oxygen, like OCH2. But wait, in the NMR, it's a doublet, so it's next to another CH2 group, perhaps.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let's imagine the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another group. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the structure should have 8 carbons.

Let me sketch this out. Maybe it's like a benzaldehyde with some substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted phenyl group attached to an aldehyde and some other groups.

Wait, another approach is to look at the reaction steps. The compound is treated with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a diazotization followed by hydroly
