Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, I'm supposed to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where all the diagonal elements are zero, and all the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. 

Wait, let me parse that. The operator's matrix A has A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, right, that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2, because the Pauli X has [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (ħ/2) times sigma_x. 

So the operator in question is proportional to the Pauli X operator. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are different from the computational basis states |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z. 

So the problem boils down to finding the probabilities of measuring |alpha> in the eigenstates of A. Then, compute the average (expected) value of A.

Wait, but first, let's get the state |alpha> normalized. Because the problem says it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, multiplied by some normalization constant. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The general approach is to compute the norm of the state vector. The state is a vector in a 2-dimensional space, with components (1+i) and (2-i). The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Calculating each term:
|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
|2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.
So the
