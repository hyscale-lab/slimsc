Okay, I have this astronomy problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about how the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and how temperature affects the distribution of atoms in different energy levels.

Alright, let's break down the problem. The star has two scenarios: one with no spots and another with 40% of its surface covered by spots. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the overall temperature decrease? Oh, because the spots are cooler and emit less radiation. So the average temperature of the photosphere goes down.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are none. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by (N1/N2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Oh, that's about 1448 angstroms, which is in the near ultraviolet or visible range. But that wavelength probably relates to the energy difference between the two levels. Let me calculate the energy difference from the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Calculating that: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1448e-10 m gives E ≈ 1.37e-18 J per photon.

But wait, each photon corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.37e-18 J. To get this in terms of temperature, perhaps we can relate it to k*T.

Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So, let's compute the exponent in the Boltzmann factor: (ΔE)/(k*T) = (1
