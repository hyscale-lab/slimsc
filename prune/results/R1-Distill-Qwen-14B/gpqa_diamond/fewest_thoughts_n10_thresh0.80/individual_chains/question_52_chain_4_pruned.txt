Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Normally, without dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. We also assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds.

I remember that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Here, E2 is higher than E1 since it's an excited state.

Wait, but the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, right? Because the problem states that when there are spots, this ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. Therefore, when the star is spotless, the ratio is higher.

Let me think. The ratio without spots is (n1/n2)_no_spots, and with spots, it's (n1/n2)_spots. The factor by which it changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

But wait, I need to relate this to the temperature. Because the effective temperature is lower when spots are present. So the photosphere's temperature is lower in the spotted regions. But wait, the overall Teff is a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas. Hmm, but the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So we're considering the average effective temperature.

Wait, but wait another moment. The effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity
