Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given that the pH is ideal, which probably means that we don't have to worry about the EDTA being protonated or anything like that. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so maybe we don't have to adjust for temperature effects. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²−, and Kf would be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that means the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I think I can call this concentration [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M.

The problem is asking for [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions. So we need to use the formation constant expression to find [Ca²+].

Let me write down the expression again: Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in a 1:1 complex like this, each mole of CaEDTA²− comes from one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Since the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, that suggests that initially, before complexation, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− were each 0.02 M? No, wait, no, because the complexing reaction actually consumes Ca²+ and EDTA^4− to form the complex.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here. So the solution contains the complex, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But the complex is 0.02 M. So the dissociation would be CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Let me set up variables.

Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced. 

But wait, the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, so the initial concentrations before any dissociation would have [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA^4−] = 0, and [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. But that's not possible because if the complex isn't formed, there's no Ca²+ or
