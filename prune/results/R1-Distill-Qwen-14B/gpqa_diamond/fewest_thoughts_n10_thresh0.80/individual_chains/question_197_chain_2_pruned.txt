Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, alright.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1—this is around the region for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C stretching, so maybe there's an aromatic ring with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR next. The 1H NMR shows several peaks. The first is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating to 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift; could that be an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes the proton is split into a doublet if there's coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton, but those are usually broader. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a proton around 10-12 ppm. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid? But then, the 1720 cm-1 in IR would fit a carbonyl, which could be a carboxylic acid. But another thought: maybe it's an aromatic system with substituents.

Next, the NMR shows at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest a substitution pattern where two protons are in each position. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. The coupling would be similar if they're adjacent to the substituents.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene or a methyl group adjacent to something. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be another set of protons, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH(CH3) group, like an isobutyl group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, probably from an ethyl group.

Putting this together: the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituents might be a carboxylic acid group and another group, perhaps an alkyl chain. But wait, the 10.5 ppm peak could be something else. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe compound X is a benzoyl derivative. Because the 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester. But the 10.5 ppm is a bit high for an al
