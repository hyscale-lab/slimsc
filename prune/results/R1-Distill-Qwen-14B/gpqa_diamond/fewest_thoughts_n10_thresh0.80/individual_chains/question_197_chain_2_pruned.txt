Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution or elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation or something else.

First, let's look at the spectral data given. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad range, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, looking at the options, some are acids which would have an O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. The strong absorption around 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹, which are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching.

Now the 1H NMR data. The first singlet at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is probably an O-H from a carboxylic acid. Because if it were an alcohol, the proton would be more downfield, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but in the NMR, it's a broad singlet, which makes me think more of an O-H from a carboxylic acid because aldehydes are usually sharp singlets. So that's a point toward a carboxylic acid.

Next, the NMR shows two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are split into two sets of doublets. So the aromatic region is consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

The rest of the NMR: 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 1H. That might be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group or maybe part of a substituent. Then at 1.7 ppm, a multiplet of 2H, perhaps part of a -CH2- group attached to something. The 1.4 ppm is a triplet (d, 3H), which could be a CH3 group attached to a CH that's split into a triplet. Like maybe a CH(CH3) group. And the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH3, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and some substituents. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl peak at 1720, which for a carboxylic acid would be around 1700-1725. But wait, in the NMR, the broad peak at 10.5 would then be the O-H of the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR also has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. So that's a carbonyl group. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1725, which fits. So combining that with the NMR, perhaps the structure is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Let me think about their structures.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid group is at position 1, and the sec-butyl group is at position 4. The sec-butyl is (CH2CH(CH2CH3)), but wait, sec-butyl is (CH2CH2CH(CH3))? No, wait. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is actually CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the substituents: sec-butyl is (CH2)2CHCH2-? Wait, no, let me think. The butyl group has four carbons. The 'sec' refers to the second carbon. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that can't be right. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: in a butyl group, the four carbons are arranged as CH2CH2CH2CH3. For sec-butyl, the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH(CH3), but wait no, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's five carbons. Wait, no, I'm mixing something up.

Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but where the attachment is on the second carbon. So it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, more accurately, the sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, wait, no. Let me write it down. The butyl group can be:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2-

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, no, because that's five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about it. For
