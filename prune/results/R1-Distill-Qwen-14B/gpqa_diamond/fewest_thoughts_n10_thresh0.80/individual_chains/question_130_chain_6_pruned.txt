Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs particular wavelengths of light. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is involved here. Let me think about this step by step.

The question says that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, isn't that in the ultraviolet range? Oh yeah, because I remember that the Lyman series is in the UV. But optical telescopes detect visible light, right? So how does this absorption affect what we can see?

So the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. If the cloud is moving away from us because of the expansion of the universe, this absorption line would shift to a longer wavelength, which is redshift. The amount of redshift depends on how far away the object is. So we need to find the minimum redshift where the Lyman-alpha line would still be detectable in optical light.

Wait, but optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because our atmosphere blocks it. So the observed wavelength after redshift has to be in the optical range, which is about 400-700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

The Lyman-alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. So if the cloud is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength lambda_obs would be lambda_rest * (1 + z). So we need lambda_obs to be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms, because beyond that is infrared, which optical telescopes can't detect. Or wait, maybe the cutoff is higher? Wait, the visible spectrum is up to about 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms. So if the redshifted wavelength is beyond that, we can't see it in optical.

Wait, no, sorry. The quasar's light is observed through the hydrogen. The hydrogen's absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. But if the hydrogen cloud is at a high redshift, the absorption line would be redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be 1216 * (1 + z). But for ground-based optical telescopes, we can't observe wavelengths shorter
