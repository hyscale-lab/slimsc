Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which reaction sequence would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think about the structure of the target molecule first.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The 3 position has a bromine, and the 5 position has a nitro group. Also, the ethan-1-one part means there's a ketone group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, no—actually, ethan-1-one is acetone, so the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (like an acetyl group) attached. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one. So the acetone part is CH3-C(O)- attached to the benzene. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 and 5, and the ketone is at position 1.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering the ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The substituents are at 3 and 5. So, if the ketone is at position 1, then the substituents at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) would be meta to each other relative to the ketone?

Wait, no—actually, when the ketone is attached directly to the benzene ring, that's the position. So the ketone is at position 1, and then substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to it. So the ring would look like: position 1 has the ketone (O=C-CH3?), wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone. So the ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene. So, the benzene is at the 1-position of the ketone.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. Benzene ring, with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, but when the benzene is attached to the ketone, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone's point of attachment. So, the benzene is connected via the 1 position to the ketone, and substituents at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2).

So, the benzene ring has:

- Position 1: connected to the ketone (so that's the point of attachment for the ethanone group).
- Position 3: Br
- Position 5: NO2

So, the substituents are at meta positions relative to each other (3 and 5 are meta on the benzene ring). Wait, no—positions 3 and 5 are adjacent if the point is 1. Wait, benzene is a ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, position
