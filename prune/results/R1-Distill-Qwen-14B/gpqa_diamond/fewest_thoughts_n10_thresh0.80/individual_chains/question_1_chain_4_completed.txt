Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width (full width at half maximum) is proportional to 1/τ1, and similarly for state 2. To resolve two lines, their separation must be at least comparable to the sum of their line widths. Or wait, maybe the resolving power is such that the separation should be equal to the average of the line widths or something like that.

Wait, maybe using the concept of the resolving power in spectroscopy. The resolving power R is given by R = Δλ / λ, but in terms of energy, it's similar. But perhaps that's not exactly applicable here.

Alternatively, the energy resolution is such that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states. Because if the two energy levels are too close, their spectral lines would overlap, and you can't distinguish them.

So, let me calculate the uncertainty for each state.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) ≈ 5.27e-26 J.

Wait, but we need this in eV because the options are in eV. Let's convert Joules to eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So, 1 J is 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So ΔE1 in eV is 5.27e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. That's 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 τ2) = (1.054e-34)/(2 * 1e-8) ) ≈ 5.27e-27 J.

Convert that to eV: 5.27e-27 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 5.27e-27 J times 6.242e18 eV/J is approximately (5.27 * 6.242) * 1e-27 + 18 = 32.93 * 1e-9 eV? Wait no, 1e-27 + 18 is 1e-9. Wait no, 5.27e-27 * 6.242e18 = 5.27 * 6.242 = about 32.9, and the exponents: 1e-27 *1e18 = 1e-9. So 32.9e-9 eV is 3.29e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is approximately 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

To resolve these two states, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is smaller than either uncertainty, the lines might overlap.

Wait, but which one is larger? ΔE1 is 3.29e-7, which is 3.29 x 10^-7 eV. ΔE2 is 3.29e-8, which is 0.329e-7 eV. So ΔE1 is 10 times larger than ΔE2.

So the minimal ΔE needed would be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. So the energy difference must be bigger than 3.29e-7 eV. Because if you have a difference larger than that, the peaks won't overlap.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what's available.

Options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is smaller than both ΔE1 and ΔE2? No, because 1e-9 is 0.001e-7, which is way smaller than 3.29e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → that's 1e-4, which is much larger than 3.29e-7. So that's 1e-4 is 10,000 times larger than 3.29e-7. So this would be sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → which is 1e-8, which is 0.1 times 1e-7, which is 0.1 times larger than ΔE2 (3.29e-8 is about 3.29e-8, and 1e-8 is 1e-8). So 1e-8 is a bit smaller than ΔE2. Wait, no, 3.29e-8 is 3.29 x 1e-8, which is 3.29e-8 eV. So option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 32% of ΔE2. So that's even smaller than ΔE2. So it's insufficient.

Wait, so the energy difference must be significantly larger than the larger uncertainty to be resolvable. So looking back, the uncertainties are 3.29e-7 and 3.29e-8. So the larger is 3.29e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than that.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, because 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4. 3.29e-7 is 0.000000329. So 1e-4 is 300,000 times larger. So yes, option C is way larger than the required.

Option A is 1e-9, which is 0.001e-7, which is way smaller than 3.29e-7. So can't be.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait. Is there another approach? Because I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think about it: the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. The energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So the state with a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) has a larger energy uncertainty.

So to resolve the two, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than both, it's definitely resolvable.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The uncertainty principle says that the energy cannot be determined more precisely than ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So the state with a shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So, the energy uncertainty for E1 is larger than that for E2.

If I'm looking at the energy difference between E2 and E1, the difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is much larger than either, they can be distinguished. Otherwise, if the difference is smaller than either, they might overlap.

Wait, but in reality, the requirement is that the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states. Because each state contributes to the uncertainty in their measured energy. So the total uncertainty would be ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute that.

ΔE1 = 3.29e-7 eV

ΔE2 = 3.29e-8 eV

Sum = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be bigger than about 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger. So that's acceptable. The other options are all way smaller.

Wait, but what about option D? It's 1e-8 eV, which is less than ΔE2, so that's no good. Option A is 1e-9, way too small. Option B is 1e-11, even worse.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state:  

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \).  

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \times \frac{1}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \times \frac{1}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be significantly larger than the uncertainties of both states. The larger uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Thus, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \), which is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).  

Answer: C
