Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about optical activity. So, the question is how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity. The options are A to D, and the choices are numbers from 2 to 5. Let me think about each compound one by one.

First, I remember that for a compound to be optically active, it must have chirality. Chirality requires a molecule to have a stereogenic center (a carbon with four different substituents) or another form of asymmetry, like a planar chirality. Also, the compound shouldn't have a plane of symmetry because that would make the stereoisomers identical, leading to no optical activity.

Let's list each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one

Let me analyze each.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, actually, since it's but-1-ene, it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. Let me visualize: the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 and C4? Wait, maybe it's better to draw it. But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Looking for any carbon with four different groups. The molecule is Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2-? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, the structure is C(Cl)=CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2. So the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then single bonds to C3 and C4.

Wait, but does this molecule have a double bond with substituents that could lead to E/Z isomerism? Yes, it's a (Z) isomer. But does that make it chiral? For a double bond to lead to chirality, the substituents on each carbon must be different. But I don't think so because in this case, the substituents on either side of the double bond may not be all different. Let me see: the substituents on the double bond are Cl and CH3 on one side, and on the other side, two CH2 groups? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center adjacent to the double bond. Wait, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. If that's the case, then the CH2Cl group is attached to the double bond. But that carbon (C1) is Cl, two CH2 groups, and a double bond. So no, that carbon doesn't have four different substituents. So does the molecule have any chiral centers? No, because all other carbons in the chain are CH2 or CH3, which don't have four different groups. So this compound probably doesn't have a chiral center and hence is not optically active. Unless there's an allene or something, but I don't think so. So compound 1: no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me think. The formula includes a bicyclic system. The substituents are chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-?), and the structure has a hexahydro ring. Methanoisobenzofuran suggests a fused ring system with a ketone or similar. The E configuration indicates a double bond. So, do the substituents on the double bond create any chirality? Or perhaps the bicyclic system itself leads to chirality. Alternatively, the molecule might have multiple stereogenic centers. The presence of R and S in the name suggests that. So, this molecule likely has at least one chiral center, so it's optically active. So compound 2: yes.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When substituted with methyl groups on C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, check each of the central carbons. Carbon 2: attached to two CH3 groups, a COOH, and a CH(CH3). Wait, no, let me think: the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has two methyl groups, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group? Wait, no, the substituents on C2 are two CH3, a COOH, and a -CH(CH3)-COOH group? Or perhaps let me write it: C2 has substituents: R (from C1: COOH), two CH3, and a C3 (which has another CH3 and COOH). Wait, no, wait. Let me think: each of C2 and C3 has methyl groups
