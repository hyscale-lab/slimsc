Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's see.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I should normalize this state because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, right? Oh wait, wait. The question says it's proportional, so maybe we need to normalize it first.

So the state can be written as |alpha> = a(1+i)|up> + a(2-i)|down>, where a is a normalization constant. So the normalization condition is |a|^2 [ |1+i|² + |2-i|² ] = 1.

Let me compute |1+i|². That's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 =2. Oh wait, no, wait. |a + ib|² is a² + b². So 1² +1² is 2. Similarly, |2-i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the sum is 2+5=7. So |a|² *7 =1 → |a|=1/sqrt(7). Therefore, a=1/sqrt(7), but I think the actual value depends on the phase, but since we're dealing with probabilities, the phase doesn't matter here.

So now, the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator has a matrix representation Aij where Aij= hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the basis? Oh, the eigenstates of the z-projection, so |up> and |down> are the basis vectors. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out:

The matrix elements are:
A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1)
A_12 = hbar/2 (since i=1, j=2)
A_21 = hbar/2 (since i=2, j=1)
A_22 =0 (i=j=2)

So the matrix looks like this:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Hmm, that's interesting. This looks like a spin operator maybe in the x-direction or something. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator is (hbar/2) σ_x.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. So for the operator A, we need to find its eigenstates because the probability of measuring each eigenstate would be |<eigenstate|alpha>|².

So to find the eigenstates of A, I can diagonalize it. Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, and σ_x has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues and
