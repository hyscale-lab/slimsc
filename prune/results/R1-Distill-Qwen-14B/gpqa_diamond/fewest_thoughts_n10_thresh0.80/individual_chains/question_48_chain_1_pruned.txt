Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Let's break down each step and see what's happening.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone has a ketone group. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a addition reaction. But wait, bromine can also undergo other types of reactions. Oh right, cyclohexanone has a conjugated dienone structure? Wait, no, that's for something else. Oh wait, maybe it's about the enol formation. Or maybe it's an oxidation?

Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When treated with bromine (Br2), I think it's more likely to undergo an addition reaction. So perhaps it's the bromine adding across the carbonyl group. But wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, so it can't form an aldehyde, which sometimes happens with oxidation. Oh wait, maybe it's a bromination via enol formation. Alternatively, could it be a diaddition? Let me think. Oh, wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone could undergo a nucleophilic addition with Br2. No, bromine is more of an electrophilic reagent. Oh, I think I remember that when ketones react with Br2 in a specific solvent, like maybe in a non-polar solvent, they can undergo a bromination via the enol mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic bromination if there's an adjacent double bond. Wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. So perhaps the first step is an addition reaction where Br adds to the carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of a base, maybe it's an enolate. But the question doesn't mention a base here. Hmm. Oh, wait, another reaction: when ketones react with bromine (Br2), they can form a dibromide via conjugate addition. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so maybe it's undergoing a bromohydrin formation? No, that would be with water. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diels-alder type reaction, but that's a big stretch.

Wait, maybe the first step is the addition of bromine across the carbonyl group. So the carbonyl oxygen is attacked, leading to the formation of a bromide. But wait, the carbonyl group is electrophilic, so bromine could add across the carbonyl. The mechanism would be the bromine opening the carbonyl, forming a bromide. Let me think. The cyclohexanone has the structure (CH2)5C-O. So when Br2 adds, perhaps it forms a geminal dibromide? So the product would have two Br atoms on the same carbon where the carbonyl was. So product 1 would be 1,1-dibromocyclohexane. Wait, no—cyclohexanone is (CH2)5-C-O, so adding Br2 would add two Brs across the carbonyl, turning it into a gem-dibromide. So product 1 would be 1,1-dibromocyclohexane.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, ketones can undergo a reaction with bromine to form a bromoketone, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via some other mechanism, but I think the most straightforward is the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl, making a gem-dibromide.

So product 1 is 1,1-dibromocyclohexane. Now, moving to the next step: product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. So NaOH and heat—this sounds like an elimination reaction or maybe a substitution. But wait, the starting material is a dibromide. In a dibromide, especially a geminal one (both bromines on the same carbon), heating with base would likely lead to an elimination reaction. Because two leaving groups on the same carbon can undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond.

So, product 1 is 1,1-dibromocyclohexane
