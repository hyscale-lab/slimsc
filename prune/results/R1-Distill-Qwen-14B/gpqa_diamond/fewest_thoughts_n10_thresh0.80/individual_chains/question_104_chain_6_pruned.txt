Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars with the same mass as our Sun. They found one planet each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The orbits are circular.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line. Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the star's velocity due to the planet. But how does that translate into the orbital period?

Wait, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) is involved here. The formula is something like K = (V*sin i) where V is the velocity of the star. But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) or something like that. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. But I think the key relation is that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1+ M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )^(something). Wait, maybe I should recall the formula more accurately.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ (1 year in seconds? ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (1/(1 - e^2)) )^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for a simpler version. Since the problem states that both stars have the same mass (solar masses), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is roughly the same for both. The orbital periods are what we're comparing.

Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. How? Let's think about the formula again.

The formula for K is:

K = ( ( (27 * pi * G) ) / (c * (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (P/ (2 pi) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the Doppler shift and Kepler's laws.

Wait, the RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ), perhaps? Because from the radial velocity method, the formula that relates K to the planet's orbital period and mass is:

K = ( ( (G * P) / (2 *
