Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So the question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a Neptune-sized planet. They're using the RV method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The masses of the planets are similar to Neptune, so I'm guessing their masses are about the same, but the question is about the orbital periods.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milangstrom shift. I remember that the RV method detects the star's velocity towards and away from us because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The amplitude of this wobble (the velocity) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula... I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = (V) which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. Oh right, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^0.5 )) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P * (1 day in seconds) )^(1/3) )) * (1/(1 AU in meters )^(1/3) )... Wait, that might be complicating things. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period when other factors are considered.

Wait, let me think. The RV method relies on the Doppler shift. The formula relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the planetary mass, the orbital period, and the stellar mass. The formula for K is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) ) ]^(-1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P) )^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets are Neptune-sized and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So that term becomes (M_star)^(2/3) in the denominator. Wait
