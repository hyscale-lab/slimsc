Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question. Let's read it again and think through step by step.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It says the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with some endpoint Q. So in the first scenario, each E has kinetic energy that can vary up to Q. I remember that when particles are emitted in a decay, their energy can be continuous if they share energy with other particles, leading to a spectrum. For example, in beta decay, the electron's energy is continuous up to a maximum value because the electron and antineutrino share the energy.

Now, the variant is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Here, instead of two V particles, it emits one M, which is massless. I'm guessing that M is maybe like a photon or a neutrino since those are massless. 

I need to figure out how the energy spectrum of E changes. In the first case, with two Vs, the E particles' spectrum is continuous. So why is that? Because the decay involves multiple particles, so the energy is shared, leading to a continuous distribution. 

In the second case, we have fewer particles emitted. The V's are gone, replaced by M. Wait, but how does that affect the energy sharing? Let me think.

In the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. Since they are light, their energies are determined by the available Q value of the decay. The E and V particles share the energy, so each E can have a range of energies, hence the continuous spectrum. The maximum energy (endpoint Q) would be when one E takes as much energy as possible, and the others take the minimum, but wait, in the first case, two E and two V are emitted, so maybe the energy is shared among all four particles. So each E could have a maximum up to Q, but the total would be 2E + 2V energies sum up to the available energy Q.

In the second case, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So now, instead of two V, we have one M. Wait, but the original decay had two V and two E, so four particles in total. The variant has two E and one M, so three particles. 

But wait, the problem says the variant emits one M instead of two V. So in the first case, 2V were emitted, and now it's 1M. So the number of particles emitted in the second case is 2E + 1M, making three particles. 

Since M is massless, it could carry away energy and momentum. So how does this affect the E particles?

In the first scenario, the energy is shared between 2E and 2V. So the energy each E can have is variable. The maximum energy for each E would be when all the other particles (the other E and Vs) are at rest, but since they are moving, their energy would be distributed.

In the second scenario, the energy is shared between 2E and M. But M is massless, so it's like a photon. Photons carry energy and momentum but have zero rest mass. So in this case, the energy of the E particles and M would have to add up to the total available energy, but the distribution is different.

Wait, in the first case, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So the total energy released (Q) is distributed among four particles. In the second case, it's distributed among three particles (2E + 1M). So each E might have a higher average energy, but how does that affect their spectrum?

Wait, but the question is about whether the E's spectrum is continuous or discrete. In the original case, E's have a continuous spectrum because the energy is shared between multiple particles. 

If in the variant, the E's are only sharing energy with M, which is a single massless particle, how does that change things? Let's think about the degrees of freedom. In the original decay, there were four particles (2E, 2V) each carrying away some energy. In the variant, three particles: two E and one M.

Wait, but M is massless. So what's the phase space for this decay? The number of particles is less, but I'm not sure yet.

In the original process, the energy is shared among four particles, so the E's have a continuous distribution. In the variant, when there are three particles, maybe the energy distribution for E becomes something else. Or wait, perhaps it's more constrained.

Wait, I remember that when you have a decay where one of the products is a photon (which is massless), the photon's energy can vary, leading to a continuous spectrum for the photon. But in this case
