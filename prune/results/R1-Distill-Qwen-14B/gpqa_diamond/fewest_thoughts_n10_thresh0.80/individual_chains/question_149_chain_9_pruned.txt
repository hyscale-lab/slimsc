Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a small peptidic compound's analysis. The 1H NMR shows some anomalies, and the LC-MS does too. Let's break it down.

First, the NMR part. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly fine except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, it's like the same proton is split into two peaks. But coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling. Hmm, so why would a single proton show two peaks?

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a diastereomer. If the molecule has some stereocenters, diastereomers would have different NMR shifts. But then, the integrals would add to 1H... Oh wait, in diastereomers, each diastereomer would have its own set of protons. But if there are two diastereomers, each with one alpha proton, then in the NMR, each would cause a split. Wait, but how?

Or maybe it's about epimers. If the alpha carbon is a chiral center, but perhaps the diastereomers are in a certain ratio. Wait, but if there's a mixture, the NMR would show peaks for each enantiomer, but if it's a diastereomer mixture, the shifts would be different. But in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts and equal integral, adding to 1H. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: double coupling isn't the issue, which the question says. So, what else leads to the same proton appearing as two peaks? Maybe some sort of tautomerism or ring current effects? Or perhaps the compound is a racemic mixture. Wait, a racemic mixture would have enantiomers, which would make their NMR signals identical because they are mirror images. So then the integrals would add up to 2H, not 1H. So that doesn't fit either. So if the two peaks are same integral, wait, the question says together integrate to 1H. So each is about 0.5H? That can't be, because you can't split a proton into two 0.5H. Unless it's a 2:1 ratio, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another angle. The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So the molecular weight is the same. So maybe it's not a matter of different compounds; they have the same mass. So it's not a precursor because the mass is same as expected. So option A is probably out.

So, options left: B, C, D.

Option B says the compound is a mixture of enantiomers. But if so, in 1H NMR, the peaks would average unless the compound is chiral and the solution isn't pure. Wait, but for enantiomers, the NMR would show the same peaks because they're mirror images. So why two peaks? Because in racemic mixture, the NMR doesn't split. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too familiar with that term, but maybe it refers to some side reaction during peptide synthesis where two bonds form, leading to an isomeric mixture. But I'm not quite sure.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But if the two diastereomers each have the same alpha proton, but in different environments, so their shifts are similar. But why would the integrals add to 1H? Because each would contribute a certain amount. Wait, but diastereomers are different compounds, so each would have their own set of protons. If the mixture is 50:50, the NMR would show each peak as 0.5H each? But the integral is for each peak. So together, they add up to 1H. That makes sense. 

So, if the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, each with an alpha proton in a slightly different environment, you'd see two peaks for that proton, each integrating to 0.5H. But why would the LC-MS show two peaks with same mass? Because the molecular weight is the same. Oh wait, diastereomers have same molecular weight but different physical properties, so in LC-MS, they would elute at different times but same mass. That fits the description.

So looking back, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same shift (similar), same integral each (so 0.5H each). Since they are diastereomers, the NMR would show their respective shifts. But why would the shifts be similar? Because the diastereomers are probably enantiomers when considering a specific stereocenter. Wait no, diastereomers are not mirror images. Wait, if the diastereomers differ in configuration at only one stereocenter, then the alpha proton would be in a different environment. But why would their shifts be similar? Maybe because the overall structure is similar, so the shift isn't too different.

Now the LC-MS part: two peaks of same mass, same intensity, probably because it's a 1:1 ratio. So the same number of molecules, but split into two because they have different retention times (due to different physical properties, like diastereomers).

So putting it together, the most likely explanation is that the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. Which would explain the NMR and the LC-MS results.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (adding up to 1H). Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A (Contamination with a precursor):**  
   A precursor would have a different mass, leading to distinct peaks in the LC-MS spectrum. Since both peaks have the same mass, this explanation is unlikely.

2. **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):**  
   Enantiomers are mirror images and would produce identical NMR signals due to their symmetry.
