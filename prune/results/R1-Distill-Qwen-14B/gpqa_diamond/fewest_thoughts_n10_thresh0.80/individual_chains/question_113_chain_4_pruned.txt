Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all similar but varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's start by looking at each piece of data one by one and see what information it gives us.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, right? So that might be a clue.

Then, two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) typically absorb around 1650-1900 cm⁻¹. The exact position can tell us what kind of carbonyl it is. For example, aldehydes are usually around 1720, ketones around 1715, esters a bit lower, maybe 1740 or so? Wait, maybe I should think again. Wait, actually, I think that the 1700 region is for maybe esters or ketones. A peak at 1650 might suggest something else, like conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Wait, or wait, another thing: the 1650 cm⁻¹ could be an aromatic C=C stretch. Aromatic rings have C=C absorption around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹, but if it's conjugated with something else, maybe it's higher. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group in a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have a lower wavenumber than a regular carbonyl. Because conjugation lowers the wavenumber.

So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and possibly
