Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectra data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which formula corresponds to the given FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data.

Let's break down each piece of data and see what they tell me about the compound.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak here could suggest either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typically where carbonyl groups (like C=O) show up. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic one, or maybe another functional group like conjugated double bonds or an amide. But since it's a strong absorption, I'm thinking of a carbonyl group.

So, if both 1700 and 1650 are present, maybe the compound has two different carbonyl groups or a conjugated system. Alternatively, the 1650 could be from an aromatic ring, like in an aromatic ester or something. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. The conjugated system could cause the carbonyl peak to shift a bit.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have a double bond, possibly conjugated with another group, maybe the carbonyl.

Looking at the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm. The molecular ion would be the molecular weight. The options are all C6HxOy. Let's calculate their molecular weights.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molar mass is (6*12)+(12*
