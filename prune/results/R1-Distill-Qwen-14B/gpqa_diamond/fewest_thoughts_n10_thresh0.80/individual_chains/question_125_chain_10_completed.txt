Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that this potential corresponds to Hooke's law in three dimensions. The system is in spherical coordinates, and the question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I need to recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think each energy level depends on the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, for a 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy is given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n_x + n_y + n_z. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh yeah, each direction contributes n_i + 1/2, so the total is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the energy E is (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y +n_z.

But in three dimensions, the states are degenerate because different combinations of quantum numbers can give the same n. The degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, or is it (n + 2)(n + 1)/2? Wait, no, more accurately, for each n, the number of states (degeneracy) is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. In three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. For each n, the number of states is (n + 2 choose 2) because you're distributing n quanta among three directions, allowing for zero in each. So the formula is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2. So for n = 0, you have (2)(1)/2 = 1 state. For n=1, it's 3 choose 2, which is 3 states. But wait, I might have gotten that wrong. Alternatively, in 3D, the degeneracy for a given energy level n is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2. Wait, actually, I think that's correct because for each n, the number of possible combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that sum to n is (n+2 choose 2). Let me check with n=0: (0+2)(0+1)/2= 2*1/2=1, correct. For n=1: (3)(2)/2=3, correct. For n=2: (4)(3)/2=6, yes. That makes sense.

So the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what defines the excited states here. The ground state is n=0, first excited state n=1, second n=2, third n=3. So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Right, because E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

Now, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for n=3 is (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2=10. So that's 10 eigenfunctions.

Looking at the options, option A says energy (9/2) ℏω and 10 eigenfunctions, which matches. Option C is same energy but 3 eigenfunctions, which is wrong. The others have different energies, so they can be dismissed. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, to double-check, let me make sure about the states. So n = 3, so the sum of quantum numbers is 3. The possible combinations are (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2), (1,1,1). That's 10 combinations, so 10 eigenfunctions. Yep, that's correct.


The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are given by \( E = \hbar \omega \left( n + \frac{3}{2} \right) \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. The degeneracy of each energy level, i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue, is determined by the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the degeneracy of that state. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second to \( n = 2 \), and the third to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( n = 3 \) is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue. Among the given options, only option A matches these results.

Answer: A
