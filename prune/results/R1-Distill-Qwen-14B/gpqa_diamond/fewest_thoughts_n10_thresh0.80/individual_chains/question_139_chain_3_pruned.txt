Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about two compounds, A and B, being treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Wait, wait. Sodium nitrite and HCl... Oh right, that's usually part of a nitrous acid formation. And when nitrous acid is involved, especially with ketones or aldehydes, it might lead to some kind of reaction. Oh wait, I think this is the Stephen reduction or maybe the formation of a nitroso compound. Or wait, another possibility: the treatment could be leading to the formation of a geminal diol, which upon dehydration would form a ketone. Oh wait, no, that's when you have a carbonyl group reacting with something else.

Wait, another thought. Nitrous acid (HNO2) is used in the production of diazonium salts, but that's usually with aromatic amines, like in the Sandmeyer reaction. But in this case, the starting materials are treated with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's about the formation of a nitro compound? Or perhaps it's about the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that involves ketones and introduces an oxygen. Not sure.

Wait, I remember that when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid, it can undergo a reaction called the Stephen reduction, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about the formation of a ketone from an alcohol under certain conditions. Wait, wait. Oh! I think when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid and HCl, it can form a nitroso compound, which upon workup gives a ketone. Or wait, no, that's when you have a primary amine reacting to form a diazonium salt, but in this case, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, another approach. The products are diketones, which are compounds with two ketone groups. So both starting materials A and B, upon treatment, form two ketone groups. So perhaps the starting materials are alcohols, and the reaction converts them into ketones. But how?

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the oxidation of alcohols. Primary al
