Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, each with different expressions involving exponentials.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), but since it's given, I just need to compute it correctly.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 =8 possible configurations. I think I should list all the possible states and calculate the energy for each, then add up the exponentials.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a smarter way without listing all possibilities. Let me think about the structure of the energy term.

The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So for each pair (S1S2, S1S3, S2S3), their product is either +1 or -1, because each spin is ±1. So each term S_i S_j is ±1.

Wait, so the total energy E = -J (sum of each pair's product). So let me think about each possible state.

Let me denote the three spins as S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1.

The possible values for each pair product:

S1S2 can be 1 if they are the same, -1 otherwise. Same for S1S3 and S2S3.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be:

Each term is either +1 or -1, so the sum can range from -3 to +3.

Let me consider all possible states and compute the sum.

Wait, but that's 8 states. Maybe it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since the spins are symmetric, perhaps group states by the number of matching pairs.

Hmm, wait. Each spin can be aligned or anti-aligned with the others.

Wait, another approach: For each state, compute the value of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, then multiply each by exp
