Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it looks a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Then there's another clue about a reaction involving a keto acid and substance X, which produces a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.

Hmm, let's parse this. First, I'll try to figure out what each part refers to.

Starting with gas W: its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, each atom has a certain number of protons and neutrons, but a molecule would be made of atoms. So maybe each molecule of W has a particular composition. For example, if W is H2O, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like CO2 or another gas. Wait, the number of protons and neutrons being the same—so for each atom in the molecule, the number of protons (which is the atomic number) equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible atoms.

For example, deuterium (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. But that's just one atom. What about other elements? Let's see:

- Carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So 12C has p=n=6. So if the molecule is CO2, each C has 6 p and 6 n, O has 8 p and maybe 8 n (like O-16). Wait, but the molecule as a whole—if each atom in the molecule has equal p and n, then maybe the molecule is made of such atoms.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is carbon dioxide. Wait, let me think.

Wait, another approach: the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So perhaps W is CO2? Let's compute the number of protons and neutrons in each atom.

Carbon (C)
