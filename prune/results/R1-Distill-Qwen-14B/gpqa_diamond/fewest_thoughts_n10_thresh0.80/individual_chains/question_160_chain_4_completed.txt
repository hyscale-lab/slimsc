Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining on it, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. So when light passes through an aperture, the diffraction pattern in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) depends on the shape of the aperture. For a circular aperture, the first minima are at a certain angle, but this is a polygon. Oh, but wait, the question says N is infinitely large. Oh right, so as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So in the limit, this should behave like a circular aperture.

But wait, the options don't include the circular result. Wait, no, let me check. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ where sinθ = λ/(π a). But wait, wait, the standard formula for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction (which is similar) is sinθ = λ/(a), but I think for a single slit, the first minimum is at λ/a, but for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a different condition because it's 2D.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The single-slit (which is a rectangular aperture, actually) has the first minimum at sinθ = λ/a. But the circular aperture's first minimum is when the Bessel function J1 reaches zero, which is at about J1(k a sinθ) = 0, so the first zero is at k a sinθ ≈ π, which gives sinθ ≈ λ/(2a), since k=2π/λ. Wait, no, k is 2π/λ, so 2π a sinθ / λ = π → sinθ= λ/(2a). So θ ≈ λ/(2a), but that's for the first minimum.

Wait, but if the polygon becomes a circle, then the diffraction pattern would be like that of a circular aperture. So the first minima would be at angles determined by the circular case. But wait, the problem gives the options, and one of them is 1.22 λ/a, which I think is the first minimum for a single slit. Wait, no, that's the first minimum for a single slit, which is a different scenario.

Wait the options: option C is 1.220 λ/a, which I know is the first minimum formula for a single slit. But in this case, when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, which has a different diffraction pattern. So that's conflicting.

But wait, wait—no. The problem says it's an aperture with all apothems same length a. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So in the case of a regular polygon with very high N, it's approximating a circle. So the radius of the circle would be related to the apothem. Wait, the apothem a is the distance from center to the side. For a regular polygon, the radius R is related to a as a = R cos(π/N). But as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So the radius of the circle would be approximately a.

But wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern's first minimum is at θ where sinθ = λ/(π a), because the formula is sinθ = λ/(a π), which comes from J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is around π, so k a sinθ = π → (2π/λ) a sinθ = π → sinθ = λ/(2a). Wait, no, that would be λ/(2a). Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by the zeros of the Bessel function. The first minimum occurs when J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, but wait, no, the first zero is at about 3.83? Wait, no, wait. J0 has its first zero at about 2.4048, J1 at about 3.8317, J2 at about 5.1356, etc. So for the circular case, the first minima (excluding the central maximum) would be when J1(k a sinθ) = 0, so k a sinθ = 3.8317. But wait, no, wait: the minima in the far field are actually the points where the Bessel function of the first kind of order p has its zeros. For a circular aperture, the primary maxima are given by the zeros of J_{p}(k a sinθ) = 0, but the minima between maxima might be at different points. Or perhaps I'm confusing the orders here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The problem says N approaches infinity, so it's a circle. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. But in a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the zeroth order), then the first dark ring around it. The first minima around the central maximum are given by the zeros of J1. So the first minima in the far field would be at θ where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, so setting x = k a sinθ, we have sinθ = x/(k a) = (3.8317 λ)/(2 π a). So θ ≈ 3.8317 λ/(2 π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.609 λ/a. So the first minima would be at approximately 0.609 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is about the distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, wait: if it's a circular aperture, the minima are at the same angle in all directions, but wait, no, the minima are points where the intensity drops to zero. Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a series of rings. The first minimum after the central spot is an entire ring at a certain radius. So the angular position of the first minimum is θ1, and the second minimum (in terms of the next ring) would be at θ2, but I'm not sure if the question is considering all the minima in the pattern.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The problem says N is infinitely large, so it's a circular aperture. The first minima after the central maximum would be the first dark ring, which is at a certain θ. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in a circular aperture, the minima are when the Bessel function J_p(k a sinθ) has its zeros. The first minimum (the first dark ring) is when p=1, and the next minima would be higher zeros of J1. Wait, no, actually, each ring corresponds to an increase in p as an order. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall.

The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture has a series of concentric rings. The m-th bright ring corresponds to the m-th zero of the Bessel function. The first minimum after the central maximum is when the first zero of J1 occurs, which is at about 3.8317. So the angle θ would be sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2 π a). So θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ (0.609) λ/a.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 0.610 λ/a

B) 0.500 λ/a

C) 1.220 λ/a 

D) 0.506 λ/a.

So option A is about 0.610, which matches the 0.609 I calculated. But wait, the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh no, wait, in the circular case, the minima are not equally spaced. The first minima would all lie on a ring at θ1, but wait, no, perhaps in this context, the question is considering the angular positions where the minima occur.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says "the angular distance between the first two minima". So the first minimum is θ1, then the second minimum is the next minimum after that. But for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ1, then the next (second) minimum is actually the next ring's minimum, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the minima in the far field as the minima in the diffraction pattern, which for a circular aperture, the minima are at the same angle for all points around the circle, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So maybe the first minimum occurs at θ1, the next at θ2, and the difference is θ2 - θ1. But for a circular aperture, all minima except perhaps the first are annular rings. Wait, but in reality, the first minimum is a ring at a certain θ, then the next minima are not in the same direction but form a ring with higher radius. So the angular spacing between successive minima would depend on how the zeros of the Bessel functions are spaced.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the polygon as a slit of width a, but that's not the case. Wait, but for a polygon with a very large N, the shape approximates a circle, but maybe the approach is to model it as a slit. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I should think about the general approach.

Wait, when light passes through an aperture, the diffraction pattern in the far field is determined by the Fourier transform of the aperture's transmission function. For a regular polygon with N sides and apothem a, as N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle of radius R. The apothem a is the distance from the center to the side; for a regular polygon, the relation between the apothem a and the radius R is a = R cos(π/N). As N becomes very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R is approximately equal to a.

So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius R ≈ a. Then, the diffraction pattern is the same as that of a circular aperture of radius a.

The angular position of the minima in a circular aperture is determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minima (excluding the central maximum) occur when J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k = 2π/λ. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317. So:

k a sinθ = 3.8317 → (2π/λ) a sinθ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ) / (2π a).

Since the angles are small, sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ. So θ ≈ (3.8317 λ) / (2π a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.609 λ/a.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, in a circular aperture, the minima are all at the same θ, which would imply that the angular spacing is zero, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the first minima refers to the first and second minima in terms of their positions around the pattern, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of this differently. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is a ring around the central maximum. The next minima would be at a higher radius. The angular positions for each ring are determined by the zeros of higher Bessel functions. Wait, no, each ring corresponds to the same Bessel function but higher order zeros. So the first ring is J1, the next ring is J1 again, but the next zero would be the next zero of J1, which is at 3.8317 + 6.9813 = 10.813, etc. Wait, no, each ring is a different order. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here.

Wait, perhaps for a circular aperture, each maximum in the diffraction pattern corresponds to the zeros of J_p, where p is the order. The first ring is the first zero of J_1, so p=1, then the next ring would be p=2, etc. But that's not right. Wait, I think the first zero of J_1 (p=1) is the first minimum beyond the central maximum. The next minima would be the zeros of J_1 again, but higher order? Or perhaps the next minima are the zeros of J_2.

Wait, perhaps not. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture has a central maximum, then a first minimum (a dark ring), then a bright ring, then another dark ring, and so on. The dark rings correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind of order p, where p increases each time. So the first dark ring is J_1=0, the next dark ring is J_2=0, then J_3=0, etc. So the angular positions for each dark ring are given by:

sinθ = (x_p m) λ/(2 π a),

where x_p m is the m-th zero of J_p.

So the first dark ring (m=1) is J_1=0, x=3.8317.

The second dark ring is J_2=0, x=5.1356.

So θ1 is the angle for J_1=0, θ2 for J_2=0.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum occurs at θ1, the second at θ2, and the angular distance is θ2 - θ1.

So let's compute both θ1 and θ2.

θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ 0.609 λ/a.

θ2 = (5.1356 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ 5.1356/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.816 λ/a.

So the angular distance between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1 ≈ 0.816 - 0.609 ≈ 0.207 λ/a.

But that's not one of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem isn't about the circular aperture but about a very large polygon that approximates a different shape or handling it as a single slit.

Wait, wait, perhaps the polygon is being treated as a rectangular aperture? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the problem is about a polygon that when N is large, the shape approximates a circle, but the diffraction pattern is calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a multi-slit structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the problem again. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the first minima would be the first and second minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that θ1 ≈ 0.609 λ/a, and θ2 ≈ 0.816 λ/a, so the angular distance between them is about 0.207 λ/a, which isn't an option here. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case but something else. Wait, if N is very large, perhaps the polygon can be approximated as a rectangular aperture whose width is proportional to a. Wait, but the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular polygon with N sides, the width (diameter) would be 2 a cot(π/(2N)). As N approaches infinity, cot(π/(2N)) ≈ (2N π)/(π) ) → 2N π / (π) )= 2N, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, for very large N, the width approaches 2a. So the width is about 2a. But how does that relate to the diffraction pattern?

Wait, another approach: perhaps for large N, the polygon's diffraction pattern can be approximated as a single slit of width a. But wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, so for a regular polygon, the width (distance between two opposite sides) is 2a. So perhaps the slit width is 2a.

Wait, but a single slit of width w has its first minimum at sinθ = λ/w. So if the width is 2a, then sinθ = λ/(2a). So θ ≈ λ/(2a) (since angles are small). But wait, for a single slit, the first minima are at θ where sinθ = λ/(w/2) if the slit is of width w. Or wait, the single-slit formula is sinθ = λ/a, where a is the slit width. So if the width is 2a, then sinθ = λ/(2a), θ ≈ λ/(2a). But that would be the first minimum at θ ≈ (λ/(2a)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. Which is approximately λ/(2a) (approx 0.5...). So option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is close to λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a. So perhaps the angular distance between the first two minima in a single-slit is zero because all minima are at the same θ. Wait, no, wait, wait... no, in a single slit, the minima are all at the same angle, so the angular spacing would be zero, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think: in a single-slit diffraction, the minima are given by sinθ = m λ/a, where m is an integer (m=±1, ±2, ...). So the first minimum is at m=1: sinθ = λ/a → θ ≈ λ/a. The second minimum is at m=2: sinθ = 2 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first and second minima is (2 λ/a) - (λ/a) )= λ/a. But wait, that's if a is the slit width. But in our problem, the apothem is a, and the width is 2a, so if the width is w=2a, then the minima are at sinθ = m λ/w = m λ/(2a). So the first minimum is at θ1 = λ/(2a), second at θ2 = 2λ/(2a) = λ/a. So the angular distance would be θ2 - θ1 = (λ/a) - (λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5 λ/a.

Wait, but that would be the distance between the first and second minima for a single-slit of width 2a. Then, looking at the options, option B is 0.5 λ/a. But in the problem statement, the apothem is a, which for a regular polygon is the distance from the center to a side. For a single-slit approximation, the width is 2a. So if in the single-slit case, the first minimum is at m=1, θ= λ/(2a), and the second at m=2, θ=2λ/(2a)=λ/a. The angular distance between them is λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a. So option B is 0.500 λ/a.

But earlier, I thought the polygon becomes a circle, which would have the first minima at about 0.609 λ/a. But then the angular distance between minima is different. So which is correct?

Ah, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the polygon approximates a circle (so we apply the circular diffraction pattern) or a slit (so single-slit diffraction). But wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular polygon, the width (distance between two opposite sides) is 2a. So when N is large, the shape is a rectangle of width 2a and height close to 2a as well, but that's not a circle. Wait, no, no. For a regular polygon like a hexagon, the width is 2a, but the radius is a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius a / cos(0) = a.

Wait, so perhaps the apothem is a, and the radius is R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, R approaches a. So the radius is a.

Wait, but then the width (distance between two parallel sides) is 2a. So for a very large N, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a, and the width is 2a. So if you imagine the circle, the width is 2a, which is the diameter. So the width is 2a, which is the same as the diameter of the circle.

So perhaps the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture can be approximated as a single slit of width 2a. But that doesn't seem right. Wait, the single-slit formula is for a one-dimensional aperture, while the circular case is two-dimensional.

But perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, leading to the first minima at θ = λ/(2a), and the next at θ = 2λ/(2a)= λ/a. The angular distance between them is λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a, matching option B.

But wait, the problem says it's a polygon, and when N is infinitely large, perhaps it's more appropriate to model it as a circle, leading to a different answer. But earlier, the calculation for the circular case gave the first minimum at 0.609 λ/a, but the options don't have that. Wait, option A is 0.610 λ/a, which is very close to 0.609.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So in the circular case, after the central maximum, the first minimum is a ring, and the next minima are at higher θ, but the angular distance between the first two minima (first and second) would be the difference between their θ's.

Wait, in the circular case, the first minimum is at θ1=3.8317 λ/(2 π a) ≈ 0.609 λ/a, and the next minimum is when J_2 hits its first zero at 5.1356. So θ2=5.1356 λ/(2 π a) ≈ 0.816 λ/a. So the angular distance is 0.816 - 0.609 ≈ 0.207 λ/a, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is not in the circular case but as a single slit. If the polygon is approximated as a single slit with width 2a, then the minima are at θ= m λ/(2a). So the first minimum is at m=1: θ= λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5 λ/a. The second is at m=2: θ= 2λ/(2a) = λ/a.

Wait, but the angular distance between the first two minima would be (λ/a) - (λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a. Which is option B.

But wait, the question says "the first two minima". So if the first minima is at θ1= λ/(2a), and the second at θ2= λ/a, then the angular distance between them is λ/(2a), 0.5 λ/a.

But why would the polygon, which is a 2D shape, be approximated as a 1D slit? Oh, perhaps because when N is very large, the shape is rotationally symmetric, and the diffraction pattern is determined by the diameter (width) of the aperture.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture of width 2a and height approaching infinity, which would make it behave like a slit of width 2a.

So in this scenario, the minima are at θ= m λ/(2a), m=1,2,...

So the first two minima are at θ1= λ/(2a) and θ2= 2 λ/(2a) = λ/a. The angular distance is θ2 - θ1= (λ/a) - (λ/(2a)) )= λ/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a. So the answer would be option B.

But earlier, the calculation for the circular case gave a different answer. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the circular case but about the single-slit case because the polygon is being treated as a slit, which is a 1D problem. But why would an N-sided polygon with a given apothem a (a 2D shape) be modeled as a single slit (1D)?

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is being treated as a circular aperture, so the first minima is at θ ≈ 0.609 λ/a, which is option A. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first minima is at θ1=0.609 λ/a and the next at θ2=0.816 λ/a, the difference is 0.207 λ/a. None of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first minimum as the first dark spot in the pattern, and the second minimum as the next one in the same direction, but that doesn't make sense for a 2D pattern.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the original problem. The question says "the angular distance between the first two minima". So perhaps it's considering the first two minima in the diffraction pattern, which for a circular aperture would be the first and second zeros of J1. So the angular distance would be the difference between the first and second zeros.

Wait, no, J1 has its zeros at 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So the second zero is at x=7.0156. So θ1=3.8317 λ/(2 π a) ≈ 0.609 λ/a, θ2=7.0156 λ/(2 π a) ≈ 7.0156/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 1.116 λ/a. So the difference would be about 0.507 λ/a. Wait, that's approximately 0.507 λ/a, which is close to option D (0.506 λ/a).

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the first minimum is at 3.8317, and the next is at 7.0156. So the angular distance is 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839. So the difference in θ would be (3.1839 λ)/(2 π a) ≈ 3.1839/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

Ah! So the angular distance between the first two zeros of J1 is 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Wait, so perhaps the correct approach is to model it as a circular aperture and find the angular distance between the first and the second zero of J1, which would be the angular distance between the first two minima. But that's not correct because the first two zeros of J1 are 3.8317 and 7.0156. The difference is 3.1839, which gives θ_diff ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

That matches option D.

So putting it all together, when the polygon becomes a circle (N→∞), the diffraction pattern's first minima are determined by the zeros of J1. The angular distance between the first two minima (the first and second zeros of J1) is approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the diffraction pattern created by an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with apothems of length \(a\). As \(N \to \infty\), the polygon approximates a circular aperture with radius \(R \approx a\). The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1(k a \sin\theta)\), where \(k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Diffraction Minima for a Circular Aperture**:  
   The minima in the diffraction pattern occur where \(J_1(k a \sin\theta) = 0\). The first two zeros of \(J_1\) are at \(x_1 = 3.8317\) and \(x_2 = 7.0156\). The angular position of the minima is given by:
   \[
   \sin\theta = \frac{x}{k a} = \frac{x \lambda}{2\pi a}.
   \]
   For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\).

2. **Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**:  
   - For the first minimum (\(x_1 = 3.8317\)):
     \[
     \theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 0.609 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
     \]
   - For the second minimum (\(x_2 = 7.0156\)):
     \[
     \theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a} \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
     \]

3. **Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**:  
   The angular distance between the first two minima is:
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2\pi a} - \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \Delta\theta = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{2\pi a} = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
   \]
   Using \(\frac{3.1839}{2\pi} \approx 0.506\), we find:
   \[
   \Delta\theta \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern is approximately \(0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}\), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
