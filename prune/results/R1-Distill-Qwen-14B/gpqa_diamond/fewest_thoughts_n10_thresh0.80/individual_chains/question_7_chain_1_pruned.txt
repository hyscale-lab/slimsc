Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking me to find the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. Alright, let me think through this step by step.

I remember that when high-energy gamma-rays interact with the CMB photons, they can produce electron-positron pairs. This process is called photon-photon annihilation. So the reaction is γ + γ → e+ + e-. But wait, I think this is more of a pair production process when a high-energy photon interacts with a lower-energy photon. Oh right, the process is often referred to as the photon-photon interaction or bremsstrahlung, but pair production requires the energy to be sufficient to create the rest mass of the electron and positron.

So, for a gamma-ray photon (high energy) and a CMB photon (low energy), their energies must meet a certain threshold condition for the process to occur. The threshold condition is when the combined energy is just enough to create the rest mass of the pair. The rest mass energy of an electron is 0.511 MeV, so a positron has the same, so together it's about 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but the process is γγ → e+ e-. So the invariant mass squared s must be at least (2 m_e c²)^2. Let me think about the center of mass energy. The formula for the invariant mass squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2, but since the photons are moving in opposite directions (assuming head-on collision), their momenta would add in magnitude. Hmm, actually, the CMB photons are isotropic, so on average, but perhaps the maximum possible energy transfer occurs when the photons are moving in opposite directions.

Wait, another approach. The threshold condition for pair production from two photons requires that the product of their energies in the center of mass frame is at least (m_e c²)^2 for each particle, but since we're producing two particles, maybe the condition is that the sum of their energies in the center of mass frame is at least 2 m_e c².

Alternatively, the invariant mass squared should be at least (2 m_e c²)^2.

Let me recall the exact condition. I think the threshold condition is when the energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the sum of the rest energies of the products. So, sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c², where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy.

So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2.

Wait, but photons have E = p c, so for each photon, E = p c. So for two photons, if they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta would be opposite. So the vector sum of their momenta would be p1 - p2 if they're head-on. But perhaps when considering the CM frame, the momenta are such that they sum to zero? Wait no, in the lab frame, perhaps one photon is moving towards us and the other in the opposite direction. Maybe it's better to think in terms of their energies.

Wait, maybe it's easier to transform to the center of mass frame. Let me think: for two photons with energies E1 and E2, moving in opposite directions. The total energy in the CM frame is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is (E1/(c)) - (E2/(c)) in the lab frame. But wait, in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero. So, the invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since p1 c = E1, and p2 c = E2, but their directions are opposite, so it's vectorially p1 = +E1/(c) and p2 = -E2/(c), perhaps. Wait, not sure. Let me think again.

Let me consider that in the lab frame, one photon (gamma) has energy E_gamma and the other (CMB) has energy E_cmb. Let me assume they are moving in opposite directions for maximum effect. So, their momenta are opposite, so when adding, the magnitude would be |E_gamma/(c) - E_cmb/(c)|, since they're moving in opposite directions. Wait, but if they are moving in the same direction, the momenta would add, but that's not the case for maximum s. Oh, right, the maximum s occurs when the photons are moving in opposite directions because then the total momentum is E_gamma/(c) - E_cmb/(c) = (E_gamma - E_cmb)/c, but wait, no, in reality, when considering the invariant mass, the maximum s occurs when the photons are moving head-on towards each other. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the formula.

The invariant quantity is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite in direction. So, p1 = +E1/(c) in some direction, p2 = -E2/(c) in the same direction. So the vector sum is (E1/(c) - E2/(c)).

So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) c )^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Let me compute that: (E1+E2)^2 - (E1-E2)^2 = [E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²] = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2.

Ah, so the invariant mass squared is 4 E1 E2, which must be at least (2 m_e c²)^2. So,

4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2.

Simplify:

E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So, E1 * E2 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2.

But in this case, E1 is the gamma-ray energy, and E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is about 1e-3 eV.

So, E_gamma * E_CMB
