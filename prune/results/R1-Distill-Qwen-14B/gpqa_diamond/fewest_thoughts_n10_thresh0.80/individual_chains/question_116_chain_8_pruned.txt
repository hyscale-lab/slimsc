Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to NMR and organic reactions, so I'll take it slow.

So, the problem starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that triplets and quartets in NMR usually come from splitting due to neighboring protons. Let me think about possible structures.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these are probably methyl groups. Methyl groups in certain environments, like being adjacent to a CH2, often appear around 0.9 ppm. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H likely comes from a set of protons next to something with two neighboring protons. Wait, quartet means each proton is split into four, so maybe each of these H's is next to a CH2 group. 

Putting this together, maybe Compound A is a di-substituted alkane. Let's think about a structure where there are two methyl groups (each as CH3) attached to a central CH2-CH2. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, perhaps it's 2,2-dimethylbutane? No, wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, if the structure is neopentane, but that's 2,2-dimethylpropane, which has a single CH2 group. Hmm. Wait, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So, maybe it's –CH2CH2– with each CH2 having two H's. So each CH2 is next to another CH2, leading to a quartet. Wait, but if the quartet is 4H, that could be two sets of two H's each. So perhaps something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2. No, that might not add up. Wait, no—let's think about diethyl ether or something else. Or maybe a cyclopropane derivative? No, that's probably not it.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) suggests two equivalent methyl groups, each with three H's. The quartet (4H) would come from a CH2 group next to another CH2. So maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's pentane with substituents. Wait, but that has more H's. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, that's neopentane, which has five carbons and all methyl groups. Its NMR would show a singlet for the central CH2, but wait no, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, so the central carbon is connected to four CH3 groups. But in that case, the H's on the central carbon would be equivalent, but in reality, neopentane's structure is (CH3)C-C(CH3)2? Wait, no. Neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, so the structure is CH(CH3)2CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 2,2-dimethylbutane, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the integration: 6H for the triplet (probably two methyl groups), and 4H for the quartet. So maybe it's something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2- or similar. Wait, but then the quartet would be from the CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Let me think: if the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2, but that's not a complete structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2 with another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 3-methylhexane or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted cyclohexane? No, I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: the triplet and quartet could be from an ethyl group. The triplet for a CH3 next to a CH2. But in this case, 6H as triplet would be two CH3 groups each next to a CH2. So perhaps the quartet comes from the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, if the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2, but that's not a complete structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3. No, that's 2-methylpentane, which would have more than two signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2, but that's not possible without a complete structure. Maybe there's a branching point. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe Compound A is 2-methylbutane. Let me draw it. 2-methylbutane is (CH3)CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, 2-methylbutane has five carbons. Let me count. No, 2-methylbutane is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? No, that's actually 3-methylpentane. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 2-methylpropane, which is actually isobutane. No, that's a four-carbon molecule, but the NMR signals don't fit.

Wait, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is neopentane. Let's consider that. Neopentane is (CH3)C(CH2CH3). No, wait
