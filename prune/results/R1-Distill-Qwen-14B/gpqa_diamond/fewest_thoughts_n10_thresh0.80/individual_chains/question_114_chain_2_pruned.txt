Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question has two reactions, and I need to find the right reagents from the options provided. Let me look at each reaction carefully.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think that's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but ketones don't react with NaCN directly because they are not as reactive as aldehydes. Wait, no—wait, actually, in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe? Or maybe a different condition.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a substitution. Or perhaps the NaCN is acting as a nucleophile in a nucleophilic acyl substitution. But wait, ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution unless under specific conditions. Oh wait, perhaps it's a condensation reaction? Or maybe it's an addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, but
