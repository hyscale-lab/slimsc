Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cos θ), where δ_l are the phase shifts and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. 

But wait, the problem specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right! The incident direction is when θ = 0 degrees. So, the scattering angle is 0, which means we're looking at forward scattering.

I think the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) because cos(0) is 1. But wait, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1. So the forward direction simplifies the expression.

So, f(θ=0) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l * 1. The imaginary part of f would come from the imaginary part of each term in the sum. Because e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when we multiply e^{i δ_l} by sin δ_l, let's see:

e^{i δ} sin δ = (cos δ + i sin δ) * sin δ = cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ. 

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l + 1) * sin² δ_l. Because the term is (2l+1) times e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. So the imaginary part of the sum is the sum of each (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but wait—the amplitude f is (1/k) times this sum, but when taking the imaginary part, the 1/k factor just scales the whole thing. So the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but what's k? Oh, k is the wave number. For electrons, I think k would be (sqrt(2mE))/(ħ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that in atomic units or certain units, k can be calculated using the relativistic energy. Wait, the problem states that the electrons are 50 MeV. Hmm, but I'm getting a little stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the units. Because the answer options are given in fm (femtometers). So k must be in units that work out to give an amplitude in fm. Let me recall that the wave number k is (2π)/λ, where λ is the wavelength. For relativistic electrons, the energy E is related to the momentum p by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But for 50 MeV electrons, their rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger, so relativistic effects are significant. So p is approximately E/c, since E ≈ pc when E >> mc².

So the momentum p is E/c. And k = p/ħ. Let's compute k numerically.

Wait, constants:

E = 50 MeV. Let me convert that to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 50 MeV is 50e6 eV. So E = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

ħ is h-bar, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So p ≈ E/c = (8.01e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) ) = approximately 2.67e-21 kg·m/s.

Then k = p/ħ = (2.67e-21) / (1.0545718e-34) ≈ 2.53e13 m^-1.

Wait, that's a very large number. Hmm, but wait, I'm supposed to compute 1/k, right? Because the amplitude f is (1/k) * sum(...). So 1/k is approximately 3.95e-14 meters, which is 3.95e-14 m = 3.95e-2 fm. Because 1 fm is 1e-15 m. Wait, 3.95e-14 m is 0.0395e-12 m, which is 39.5e-15 m, which is 39.5 femtometers. Wait, wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, 2.53e13 m^-1 → 1/k = 1/(2.53e13) = approx 3.95e-14 m. Since 1e-15 m is 1 fm, 3.95e-14 m is 39.5e-15 m, which is 39.5 fm. So 1/k ≈ 39.5 fm.

Wait, but that's a positive number. Now, the sum over the terms: each term is (2l + 1) sin² δ_l. Let's see, the given phase shifts are δ0 =90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. And l starts from 0, so l=0,1,2,3,4.

So for each l:

l=0: (2*0+1) =1, sin²(90°)=1. So term is 1*1 =1.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3, sin^2(67) ≈ sin(67)=approx 0.9205, square ≈ 0.8473. So 3*0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: (5) * sin²(55). Sin(55)≈0.8192, square≈0.6710. So
