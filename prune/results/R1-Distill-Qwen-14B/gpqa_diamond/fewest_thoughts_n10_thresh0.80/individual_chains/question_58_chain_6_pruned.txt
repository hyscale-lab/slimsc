Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results nonphysical. Regularization helps make those infinities manageable so you can subtract them or renormalize the theory.

So the options are A through D: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version, right? It's Maxwell's equations and all that. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't involve the same quantum loop divergences. Quantum theories deal with particles and their interactions at the quantum level, where things like loops can cause infinities. But in classical electrodynamics, there's no such thing as loop diagrams or renormalization because it's all about fields and their classical behavior. So I think D doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory in the first place.

Let's look at the others. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum theory. I remember that QED does require renormalization. The electrons and photons in QED loops can lead to divergent terms. So to handle that, you need to regularize the integrals—like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. Without regularization, those infinities would make the theory not predictive. So C, QED, does require regularization.

Then there's Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is also a quantum theory. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with more complexity. And I think QCD also requires regularization because of the same kind of loop divergences. Wait, but wait—QCD is asymptotically free, right? So at high energies, the coupling becomes weak. But even then, when dealing with the theory quantum mechanically, you still have to deal with divergences. So B, QCD, needs regularization too.

Now, option A is Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory which incorporates supersymmetry. I remember that string theories aim to replace point particles with strings, which might help avoid some of the problems in quantum field theory. Because strings have a minimum size due to their vibrational modes, maybe they don't have the same kind of divergences. Or perhaps in string theory, the high-energy behavior is better behaved, so you don't need to regularize. Or wait, another thought: in string theory, the concept of a "high-energy" regime could be different because it's a theory that includes gravity and works at higher energies than standard QFT. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's a background-independent theory and handles high energies without the same divergences as QFTs.

Wait, but I'm not very sure about this. Let me think again. Regularization is a tool used to handle divergences in perturbative calculations. In string theory, especially superstring
