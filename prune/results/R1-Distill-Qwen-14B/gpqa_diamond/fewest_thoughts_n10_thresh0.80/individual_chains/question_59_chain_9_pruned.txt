Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. We need to find the pH of the resulting mixture.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, the first thing to do is figure out if they neutralize each other or if there's an excess. Since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they'll probably react completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it might not react with the base unless there's an excess of H+ ions.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Moles are calculated by Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Let's compute each:

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M, Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH⁻. So moles of OH⁻ = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the acids: HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl⁻. Each mole gives 1 mole of H+. So H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But right now, I think we can ignore its H+ contribution because when we mix with the base, the strong acid's H+ will react first.

Wait, but the base is Ba(OH)2. So OH- ions will react with H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Let me outline the reaction. The OH- will react with H+ from the acids.

The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2, which is 0.18 moles.

The H+ comes from HCl (0.08 moles) and CH3COOH (initially, but perhaps only some of it will dissociate, but maybe the strong acid's H+ is consumed first).

Wait, no, I think the OH- will first neutralize any available H+ from the strong acid. Then any
