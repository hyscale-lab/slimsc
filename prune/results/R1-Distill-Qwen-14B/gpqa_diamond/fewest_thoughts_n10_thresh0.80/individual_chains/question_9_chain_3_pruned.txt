Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about symmetry in molecules. Hmm, the question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. C3h symmetry—wait, what's that again? Oh right, in molecular symmetry, C3h means there's a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (σ) that includes that axis. So the molecule looks the same after a 120-degree rotation and has a plane of symmetry through it.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo-fused trifuran hexaone, and another triphenylene-fused trifuran hexaone. Let me go through each one.

First, I need to visualize each structure. Triisopropyl borate—I think that's a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. Each isopropyl is a CH(CH3)2. So the molecule would have the boron atom in the center connected to three isopropyl groups. Does that have any symmetry? Well, each isopropyl is the same, so the molecule is symmetric. But what kind of symmetry? Since all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically around the central atom, it probably has a high degree of symmetry. Wait, maybe it's D3h symmetry because of the trigonal symmetry with mirror planes. But the question is about C3h, which is lower symmetry. Hmm, maybe not.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, right? It has a bridge structure, like a norbornane but with two bridgeheads. Wait, I think quinuclidine is a bridge bicyclic amine. Structure-wise, it's a seven-membered ring but with two rings fused. Let me think about the symmetry. It's been a while. Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis of rotation, I believe. Because there are three identical bridge structures. So if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Does it have a mirror plane that includes the C3 axis? Wait, I'm a little fuzzy on that. If the molecule is symmetric with a C3 axis and a mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. But wait, quinuclidine is a chiral molecule, isn't it? Because it's
