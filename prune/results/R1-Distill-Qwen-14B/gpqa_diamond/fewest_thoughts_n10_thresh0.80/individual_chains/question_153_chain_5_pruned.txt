Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving Michael additions. Then I have to match the products to the options given. Let's take it one at a time.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, the conditions are basic because NaOEt is a strong base. The reaction is a Michael addition, which typically involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

First, I need to figure out which is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester; it's an electrophilic partner, the Michael acceptor.

So, the enolate of dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Let me draw that. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2C(COOEt)2. When it forms an enolate, the base deprotonates the alpha carbon, which is next to the carbonyl. The enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OEt, but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the structure is CH2-C(O)OEt with a p-tolyl group on the same carbon as the CH2. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the beta position, which is the CH2 next to the double bond.

Wait, no, let me get that right. The formula for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOEt. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Carbon 3 is the one attached to the COOEt, and it's substituted with the p-tolyl group.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. The formula for acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on carbon 3, which is the carbonyl carbon. No, wait, maybe the substituent is on the double bond. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CH-COOEt. The numbering is such that the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p
