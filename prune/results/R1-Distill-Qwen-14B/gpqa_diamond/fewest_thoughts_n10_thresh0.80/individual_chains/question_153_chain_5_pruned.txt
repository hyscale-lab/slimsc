Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each involves different reactants and conditions. The options give possible products for each part, so I need to figure out each one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition between an enolate and an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate is a good electron donor because it's a diester, so it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, so the setup here is that the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the acrylate. Let me sketch this out. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups on the same carbon. When deprotonated, the enolate would attack the acrylate. The acrylate in question is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2 with a methyl ester.

Wait, no: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2CO-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. No, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: acrylate is prop-2-enoate. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CHCO-OCH3? No, wait, the 3-position is the substituent. So it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached. Hmm, perhaps I should reconsider.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2 part. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, 3- would be the next carbon. Let me count: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the carbons are 1, 2, 3. So 3-position is the COOCH3 group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I'm confusing
