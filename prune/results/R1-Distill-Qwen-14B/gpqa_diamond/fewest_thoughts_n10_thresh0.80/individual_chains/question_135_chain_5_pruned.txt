Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays, right? Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. I remember that when a particle decays, the products must have enough energy and satisfy conservation laws. The problem is asking which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

The Lagrangian is provided: L(y) = -λf ψ̄f(y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y). Hmm, wait, I think I misread that. Let me parse that correctly. Oh, wait, the formula in the problem is a bit unclear. Let me try to write it out again. Oh, perhaps it's L = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like an interaction term where the boson X couples to fermions. The fermions are represented by ψ_f, and λf would be the coupling constant for each fermion species f.

So the interaction terms are between X and the fermion fields. Since X is a boson, it can decay into pairs of fermions, provided the energy is sufficient.

Wait, but to have a decay X → f f̄, the mass of the fermion f must be less than half the mass of X, right? Because each fermion would take away some energy, and the sum has to be less than the mass of X.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me think about the masses of various fermions. The charged leptons are electrons (mass ~0.0005 GeV), muons (~0.1 GeV), taus (~1.777 GeV). The quarks have masses: up and down are very light, like a few MeV, so negligible. The strange quark is around 100 MeV, the charm quark around 1.5 GeV, bottom quark around 4.5 GeV, and top is way too heavy at about 173 GeV.

So for fermions f, the decay X → f f̄ is allowed only if 2m_f < M_X. So M_X is 6 GeV. Let's compute 2m_f for each possible fermion.

Electron: 2 * 0.0005 ≈ 0.001 GeV → definitely allowed.
Muon: 2*0.1=0.2 GeV → allowed.
Tau: 2*1.777≈3.55 GeV → 3.55 <6 → allowed.
Charm quark: 2*1.5=3 GeV → allowed.
Strange quark: 2*0.1 (assuming around 100 MeV each, but wait, maybe it's higher) → 0.2 GeV? Or is the strange quark about 500 MeV? Wait, I might have mixed that up. Let me think. Light quarks: u, d ~ few MeV. Next, s quark is about 100 MeV, maybe 95 MeV. So 2*0.095=0.19 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

Bottom quark: mass around 4.7 GeV. 2*4.7=9.4 GeV. Oh wait, X is 6 GeV, so 9.4 >6 → decay into b b̄ would require 6 GeV, which is less than 9.4. So that's not allowed. So X can't decay into b quarks because the mass is too high.

Top quark is way heavier, so no decay into t quarks.

Now, which fermions are allowed? Let's see:

Electrons (e+ e-): allowed.
Muons (μ+ μ-): allowed.
Taus (τ+ τ-): allowed.
Strange quarks (s s̄): allowed.
Charm quarks (c c̄): allowed.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the interaction term: the Lagrangian is written with ψ_f. So what fermions are included in this term? Because the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so only the fermions that are in this term can be decay products. So the fermions f that are involved are the ones for which this term is in the Lagrangian.

Wait, wait. The term is written as λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). So I think this is the Yukawa coupling, where X is interacting with the fermion ψ_f. So f
