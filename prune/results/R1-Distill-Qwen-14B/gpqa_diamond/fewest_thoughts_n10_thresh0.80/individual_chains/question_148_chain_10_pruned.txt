Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with some element Y. There are five such compounds. The compounds are labeled A1 to A5, and the question is about finding the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me go through each part of the information given.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. I remember that fluorine compounds are often oxidizing agents, especially when they're in higher oxidation states. So A1 might be something like F2 in a compound? Or maybe a higher fluoride of Y.

Wait, when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 â†’ A2 + F2. Let's think about fluorine's oxidation states. Fluorine usually has a -1 oxidation state. So if A1 is a compound of Y and F, and when it decomposes, F is released, maybe A1 is a more complex fluoride that breaks down into a simpler one and F2.

Hmm, another clue is that A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so it typically doesn't react unless under certain conditions. But fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Maybe A1 is YF5? Because F5 could be a strong oxidizing agent, like in the case of chlorine trifluoride, but wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Fluorine is F2, but when it's in compounds, it's usually in -1 oxidation state. So if A1 is YF5, which is a common binary compound. When it decomposes, it might form YF3 and F2. Wait, but let me check. Or maybe YF5 decomposes into YF4 and F2? Or perhaps another
