Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to work through it step by step, even though I'm a bit rusty on some concepts.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. The NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). 

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. When it reacts with KOH (a strong base), it's likely undergoing an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a ketone. Oh wait, wait. KOH in such conditions could lead to a dehydrohalogenation. But for a dihalide, maybe it forms an epoxide or a ketone?

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, so it's likely a ketone. So the product 1 might be 1,3-adamantanone. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four six-membered rings. Removing two adjacent bromines and adding a ketone group would form an exo or endo ketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, right? So that would form a diketone? Wait, or wait, maybe it's a single ketone. Because 1,3-dibromohydrin would lead to a diol, but with KOH, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, when dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but if it's a vicinal dihalide
