Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are produced in these reactions. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? Oh right, the proton-proton chain has a few branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4, and then there's the pp-II and pp-III which are other variations. But I might be mixing up the details.

So, the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at almost the speed of light, the Sun's radius is about 7e10 cm, so the light travel time is roughly 8 minutes or so. That means the neutrinos from the core would take about that time to reach us. But if the pp-III branch stopped, that affects the production of certain neutrinos.

Wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to think about what neutrinos are produced by the pp-III branch and how their flux depends on the energy bands.

I think the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the main pp-I branch. Because in the main pp-I, the dominant neutrinos are from the reaction where a boron-8 decays into a carbon-8
