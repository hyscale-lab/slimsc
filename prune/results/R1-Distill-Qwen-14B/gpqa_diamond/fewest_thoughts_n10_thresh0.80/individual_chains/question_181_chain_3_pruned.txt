Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, okay, let's see what it's about. The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, and all other reactions continued as usual. I need to find the ratio of the neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, but I'm not supposed to know the answer yet. I'll have to think through this.

First, let me recall what the pp-III branch is. The pp chain is a process in the Sun's core where hydrogen is converted into helium through a series of reactions. There are different branches, and I think the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III are different steps in this process. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a proton (which is a hydrogen nucleus) captures a helium-3 nucleus. So the reaction is p + He-3 â†’ He-4 + a positron and a neutrino. Wait, no, I think more accurately, the pp-III branch is when two protons and a helium-3 nucleus combine. Let me get that straight.

In the proton-proton chain, the main pathway is the pp-I branch, which goes through boron-8, but when there's a lot of helium-3 around, the pp-III branch becomes active. The pp-III branch is the dominant process in regions where the density is higher, I think. But wait, the main pp chain is pp-I, and the pp-III is a side branch. So, in this problem, the pp-III branch has stopped suddenly. So what does that mean for neutrino production?

The pp-III branch produces neutrinos when a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So each pp-III reaction releases a neutrino. If this branch stops, then that particular source of neutrinos is gone. But what about the other branches? The question says all other reactions remain as they were, so the pp-I branch and any other neutrino-producing processes (like the CNO cycle, but I think that's less significant for neutrinos) continue.

Wait, what's the main source of solar neutrinos? I remember that
