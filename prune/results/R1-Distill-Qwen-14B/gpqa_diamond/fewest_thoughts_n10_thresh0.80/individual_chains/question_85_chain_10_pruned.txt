Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Since the albedos are the same, the (1 - albedo) part will be the same for both, so I can ignore that for the ratio. So the ratio will be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). Because the R_star terms cancel out.

Wait, let me get that right. Wait, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - a)^0.5. But since albedos are same, (1 - a) is same, so when taking the ratio T1/T2, it'll be sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So the ratio is sqrt(a2 / a1).

So I need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1) for Planet2 and Planet1. Wait, but how do I find the semi-major axes? The question gives me information about the RV method, so that's probably how I find the masses and then the orbital periods, but wait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet (in terms of the star's velocity). But I need to find the orbital distance, which is the semi-major axis a.

Wait, but the RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G*M_planet) / (M_star * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^0.5) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e²)^0.5 )) ) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds))) ) ), but this is getting complicated. Wait, but the problem says the orbits are circular, so e is zero, which simplifies things.

Alternatively, I think there's a simpler formula when e is zero. Let me think. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ). But since M_planet is much less than M_star, M_planet + M_star ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) )) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) * 1/(1) ), since e=0. 

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV method gives the mass function which relates to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis. The mass function f(M) = (M_planet^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^2 ) ). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, f(M) ≈ (M_planet^3 sin^3 i) / (M_star^2). Also, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to this. The formula is K = (2π G / P )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) ). Again, since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ (2π G / (P * (1 day in seconds)) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i ) / M_star^(2/3) )

But wait,
