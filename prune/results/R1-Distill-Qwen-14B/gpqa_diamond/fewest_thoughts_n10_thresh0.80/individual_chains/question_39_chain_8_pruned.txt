Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure out how to solve it. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measured the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, right?

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a certain region is given by the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region. But since the wave functions are normalized, the total probability over all space should be 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, maybe the wave function is zero outside this interval, but the given wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for some range. Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, so we have to ensure that the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 is 1.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me check: the wave function is given for the part of space where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function
