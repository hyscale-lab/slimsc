Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about space travel and time dilation from relativity, right? 

Let me read the question again. So, there's this alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their spacecraft is super fast, going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years (so about 150 years each). The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to reach Earth. The question is, how long does the trip take from the astronaut's point of view?

Hmm, the options are A) dies before reaching, B) 72 years, C)81, D)77. 

Wait, the key here is to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. Because when you're moving at such high speeds, time dilation comes into play. So from the astronaut's perspective, less time passes than from Earth's perspective.

First, I need to figure out the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Wait, I remember that the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Is that right? Yeah, that's what I recall from some astronomy stuff. So the distance D is approximately 163,000 light-years.

But wait, the speed is given as 0.99999987*c. Let me write that down as v = 0.99999987 c. So, the time experienced by the astronaut, t', is the proper time. The proper time is the shortest time measured in the moving frame, which here is the astronaut's frame.

The formula I think I need is the time dilation formula from special relativity. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is given by t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame (the stationary frame).

Wait, but to find t', I first need to compute t, the time it takes from Earth's perspective. So t is the distance divided by speed. 

So t = D / v. Since D is 163,000 light-years and v
