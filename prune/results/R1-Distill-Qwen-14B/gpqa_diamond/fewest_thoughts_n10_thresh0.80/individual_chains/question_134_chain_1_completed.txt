Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of neutralization is a topic I'm still trying to get a grip on. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy change when mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually exothermic, so the value should be negative, which aligns with the options given.

First, I need to figure out the reaction that's happening here. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

Wait, but wait. How much H+ and OH- do each of these contribute? Let me calculate the moles of each.

For HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Moles = M x V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 moles of H+. The molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. That means H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Next, Ba(OH)2 is the base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. The molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL = 0.2 L. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. OH- produced is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ and OH- will combine. The total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

So in the reaction, H+ + OH- → H2O, which is exothermic. The limiting reagent here is OH- because there's 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.28 moles of H+. So OH- will all react, and some H+ will be left.

Wait, but when an acid and base are mixed, the neutralization only goes to the point where one is exhausted. So the total moles of H+ available are 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So the H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

But wait, what about the excess H+? Since we have more H+ than OH-, the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, and there's 0.08 moles of H+ left.

But wait, another thing: the enthalpy of neutralization is often given per mole of H+ reacting. The standard value for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol. Wait, but wait—I think the question is asking about the total enthalpy change for the reaction as written, not per mole.

So let me think again. The reaction in this case is all the OH- reacting with H+ to form water. So moles of H+ reacting = 0.2 mol. So enthalpy change would be moles reacted multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, but wait another thing. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. When it reacts with a base, both H+ ions can potentially react. But in this case, since Ba(OH)2 provides OH- ions, will both H+ from H2SO4 be neutralized?

Wait, the problem is that the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. So the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28. OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react with 0.2 H+ to form 0.2 water.

But wait, each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ ions. So each mole of H2SO4 can neutralize 2 moles of OH-.

So in this case, the maximum OH- that can be neutralized by H2SO4 is 0.09 mol × 2 = 0.18 mol. Then the remaining OH- (0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02 mol) can be neutralized by HCl's H+.

Wait, so perhaps I should approach it that way.

Let me outline:

Total H+ available:

HCl: 0.1 mol H+ (from 0.5 L * 0.2 M) → 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- available:

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the OH- is the limiting reactant, as it's 0.2 mol, which can react with 0.2 mol H+.

But which H+ source reacts first?

I think the strongest acid (HCl is a stronger acid than H2SO4? Wait, wait, no, H2SO4 is a stronger acid than HCl. Wait, no, actually, HCl is a stronger acid than H2SO4 in the first dissociation. Wait, I'm a bit confused about their strengths.

Wait, actually, the first dissociation of H2SO4 is stronger than HCl. HCl is a strong acid, but H2SO4's first H is stronger than the second, but compared to HCl, I think HCl is a stronger acid. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think: HCl is a strong acid, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid where the first dissociation is complete, and the second is weaker.

Wait, no. HCl is a strong acid, meaning it completely dissociates. H2SO4, the first H dissociates completely, the second only partially. So the first H+ in H2SO4 is as strong as HCl, but the second is weaker. So when the solution is made, H2SO4 donates two H+ ions, but the second one is not as strong.

So in the reaction, the OH- will first neutralize the strongest acid's H+. So in this case, HCl is a strong acid, so its H+ will react first. Wait, but H2SO4's first H+ is also strong. So perhaps all H+ from HCl and H2SO4 react with OH-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reactant, regardless of the source.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol. OH- is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

But wait, the problem is whether all the H+ will react. Since OH- is less in amount, all OH- will react, using 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered per mole of H+ reacting. So the total enthalpy change would be moles of H+ reacting multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, but what's the value? I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So each mole of H+ reacts with OH- to produce water, releasing 57 kJ.

So in this case, 0.2 mol H+ reacting would release 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but wait, the question uses kcal as an option. Oh wait, the options have kcal and kJ. So I need to be careful with units.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So if I calculate in kJ, then convert to kcal if needed.

But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal and D as -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check the standard enthalpy of neutralization. I think that the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole, but sometimes it's given as about -1.0 kcal per equivalent?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal. But wait, each mole of H+ would contribute about that.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the enthalpy per mole for neutralization is typically -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So 57 kJ per mole.

Wait, but then for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. Because each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, B is -11.42 kcal. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal: 57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.6 kcal. So per mole, it's -13.6 kcal.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with OH-. So 57 kJ is 13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 13.6 ≈ 2.72 kcal. But that would be if each H+ releases 13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 2.72 kcal. But wait, the options have a negative, so -2.72 kcal is option A. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the reaction is between H+ and OH- → H2O.

The amount that reacts is the limiting reagent, which is OH- (0.2 moles). So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change is (moles of H+) × (ΔH per mole).

Each mole of H+ provides 57 kJ of exothermic reaction. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but -11.4 kJ is option D as -16 kJ? No, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe I should think about equivalents.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH- per mole of Ba(OH)2. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, it can neutralize 2 moles of H+.

HCl provides 1 mole H+ per mole HCl.

H2SO4 provides 2 moles H+ per mole H2SO4.

So total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.1 moles, which is 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O; ΔH = -57 kJ per mole.

So moles reacting: 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

So ΔH = 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, so perhaps the question is using a different enthalpy value? Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). But that's not matching the options. Wait, no, because 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. Or in kcal, 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal, so around -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but this is confusing because the standard value is -57 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the units in the options. The options have both kcal and kJ, which is a bit unusual. So perhaps the problem expects me to compute in kcal.

Wait, 57 kJ is 13.6 kcal (since 57 /4.184 ≈13.6). So per mole of H+, it's -13.6 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But then why is option B at -11.42? That would be if it's using 57.1 kJ (approx 57 kJ) per mole and converting to kcal. So 57.1 * 0.2 = 11.42 kJ, which is 11.42 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. But the option is -11.42 kcal, which would be 11.42 *4.184 ≈47.6 kJ. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces 2 H2O per mole of Ba(OH)2. Let me think about the overall reaction equation.

Wait, the reaction between HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 would involve all the H+ from the acids reacting with the OH- from the base.

Wait, but maybe I should write the balanced equation for the reaction. Let's see.

HCl is H+ Cl^-.

H2SO4 is 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So when they mix, the H+ ions (from HCl and H2SO4) will react with OH^- to form H2O.

So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

The OH- is 0.2 mol.

So all OH- will react, using 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

But the enthalpy is only for the reaction that occurs. So 0.2 mol H+ reacting.

But wait, what about the products? For each mole of H+ that reacts, you get one mole of H2O. The enthalpy of neutralization per mole is about -57 kJ or -13.6 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, or 0.2 * (-13.6) ≈ -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.42 kJ. So perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ.

But the options have A as -2.72 kcal and D as -16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So moles of H+ reacting = 0.2 mol.

Enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.4 kJ. So looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly the same as -11.4 kJ converted to kcal. Wait no, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much larger.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value. Maybe it's considering the reaction of Ba(OH)2 with the acids to form a salt, which might have a different enthalpy.

Wait, I'm getting confused because I'm not considering the formation of the salt. Oh wait, in neutralization reactions, the enthalpy change includes the formation of water and the salt. Oh, right! Because the neutralization reaction forms not just water but also a salt.

Wait a second. So when an acid and a base react, the reaction produces water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization includes both the formation of water and the dissolution of the salt.

Wait, but the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It says 'the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed.' Typically, the enthalpy of neutralization refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water and a salt. But in this case, the mixture includes three solutions: two acids and a base. So the reaction is more complex.

Wait, but in this problem, since it's a mixture of three solutions, the reaction would involve the H+ from both acids reacting with OH- from the base. So the neutralization would produce water and the corresponding salts from each acid and the base.

Wait, but perhaps the way to think about it is that the H+ ions from HCl and H2SO4 (which is diprotic) will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2 to form water.

But wait, perhaps I should write the overall reaction equation.

The acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2. So:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But wait, HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each HCl donates one H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic, so each H2SO4 donates two H+.

Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per formula unit.

So when HCl and H2SO4 are mixed with Ba(OH)2, the H+ from both acids will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2 to form water.

But perhaps the overall reaction should balance all the H+ and OH-.

Let me try to write the net ionic equation.

The reaction is between H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2) to form H2O.

So the net ionic equation is:

H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O (l); ΔH = -57 kJ/mol.

The total moles of H+ are 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. Therefore, only 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. But -11.4 is not present as an option. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately the same as -11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, but 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. To convert to kcal: 11400 / 4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which is if the enthalpy per mole were 57 kJ, so about 13.6 kcal per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of equivalents. Let me recount the moles.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the equivalents. Let me think: each mole of HCl gives 1 H+, each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+. So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 OH-.

So the neutralization reaction uses 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- to make 0.2 H2O.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ as an option. The closest is option B (-11.42 kcal) and option D (-16.0 kJ).

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value. For example, some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization is about -56.9 kJ/mol for HCl and NaOH. So perhaps the calculation is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -11.4 kJ. But none of the options exactly match that.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is about -11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → which is about -48.3 kJ.

C) -3.80 kcal → about -15.8 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm. So option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than 11.4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is diprotic, and when mixed with a base, both H+ ions will react. But in this case, the OH- is only 0.2 mol, which can neutralize 0.2 mol H+. Maybe the first H+ from H2SO4 is as strong as HCl, but the second is weaker. So the OH- would first neutralize the stronger H+, which would be HCl and the first H+ of H2SO4.

Wait, but that complicates things. Let me think: the H+ from HCl is stronger than the first H+ from H2SO4, but the second H+ from H2SO4 is weaker.

So in a solution with both HCl and H2SO4, the H+ comes from both. The stronger H+ (HCl) will react first, followed by the stronger H+ of H2SO4 (first H+), and then the weaker H+.

So when OH- is added, it will first neutralize the strongest H+ available, which in this case would be HCl and the first H+ of H2SO4.

Wait, but in this problem, the H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol, and the first H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 mol.

Wait, the OH- is 0.2 mol. So let's see:

First, OH- will react with HCl's H+ (0.1 mol), leaving 0.1 mol OH-.

Then, it will react with the first H+ from H2SO4 (0.09 mol), using up all the remaining OH- (0.1 mol). Wait, but 0.09 is less than 0.1.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. HCl's H+ is 0.1 mol. OH- is 0.2. So 0.1 mol H+ reacts with 0.1 mol OH-, producing 0.1 H2O. Remaining OH-: 0.1 mol.

2. Next, the first H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 mol. This reacts with the remaining 0.1 mol OH-. But 0.09 is less than 0.1, so all of it reacts, leaving 0.01 mol OH-.

So after these reactions, 0.01 mol OH- remains, and 0.08 mol H+ from H2SO4's second H+ remains.

Wait, but H2SO4's second H+ is weaker, so it may not fully dissociate. But in this case, since the solution is neutralized, the second H+ may not react as much. Or perhaps, in the initial mixing, all the H+ is available.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the problem expects us to simply sum all the H+ and OH- and proceed as if all H+ comes from both acids regardless of strength.

In that case, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2. So 0.2 H+ reacts, releasing 0.2*57 = 11.4 kJ.

But none of the options exactly match that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think about the reaction again.

Wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH- ions. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 produce 0.2 moles OH-.

Each mole of HCl produces 1 H+, and each mole of H2SO4 produces 2 H+.

So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

The OH- is 0.2.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value. For example, if the enthalpy per mole is -28.4 kJ (which is about -6.8 kcal), then 0.2 moles would give -5.68 kJ, which isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the neutralization of Ba(OH)2 with H2SO4 produces BaSO4, which is a precipitate, and this process releases heat. But I don't think that's the case here because the problem doesn't mention precipitation.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the reaction of Ba(OH)2 with both HCl and H2SO4, leading to the formation of BaCl2 and BaSO4, which have their own enthalpies of formation.

In that case, the enthalpy change would be more complex, involving the formation of multiple salts.

But I'm not sure about that. The question says 'enthalpy of neutralization,' which typically refers to the acid-base reaction producing water and a salt, but in this case, since we have two acids and a base, the products would include two different salts and water.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization as the reaction where all possible H+ and OH- are neutralized, regardless of the source. So the enthalpy change is simply based on the moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

In that case, the calculation is as before: 0.2 moles reacting, ΔH = -11.4 kJ. So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is about -11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → which is about -48.2 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

So none match -11.4 kJ exactly. But option A is -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ.

Wait, yes! Because 2.72 kcal is 11.4 kJ, because 2.72 *4.184 ≈ 11.4.

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.2 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different ΔH value. Let me think: some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57.3 kJ/mol. So 0.2 moles would give -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have that. The closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects the solution in terms of molarity and volume, but I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total volume, but that's not relevant for moles.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the H2SO4 is considered as providing one H+ per mole, not two. But that can't be right because H2SO4 is diprotic, especially in strong acid conditions.

If H2SO4 were only considered to donate one H+ (like a weak acid), then the total H+ would be 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19. Then OH- is 0.2. So OH- is in excess, but wait, no, because 0.19 < 0.2. So H+ is the limiting reagent, and only 0.19 moles react. But that would give 0.19 × (-57) = -10.83 kJ. Still not matching any options.

But the options don't have that either. So perhaps this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the reaction of Ba(OH)2 with H2SO4 as a separate reaction, which would produce BaSO4 and water. The reaction for that would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction is more than just neutralization because of the formation of BaSO4, which is a solid.

But in this problem, there's also HCl present, which complicates things. So perhaps the HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2 first, and the remaining OH- reacts with H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as follows:

1. HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Each mole of HCl neutralizes one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing two moles of H2O.

But wait, the stoichiometry would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of Ba(OH)2 requires 2 moles of HCl.

In this case, the moles of HCl available are 0.1, and moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.1.

So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 would require 0.2 moles of HCl. But we only have 0.1 moles of HCl available. So HCl is the limiting reagent.

So HCl (0.1 mol) reacts with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.1 mol BaCl2 and 0.1 mol H2O.

After this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol → 0.1 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- reacts with H2SO4.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The reaction requires 1 mole H2SO4 and 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

We have 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 left and 0.09 mol H2SO4.

So they react in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 reacts with 0.05 mol H2SO4, producing 0.05 mol BaSO4 and 0.1 mol H2O.

The remaining H2SO4 is 0.09 - 0.05 = 0.04 mol, which would have 0.08 mol H+ (since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+).

But in this case, the H+ from the remaining H2SO4 can't react with any OH- because the OH- has been fully consumed in the reaction with HCl and the first part of H2SO4.

Wait, but this approach seems more complicated. It leads to two separate reactions, and the enthalpy change would be the sum of the two.

So let's calculate the enthalpy for each step.

First reaction: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

The balanced equation is: 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

The ΔH for this reaction per mole of Ba(OH)2 is:

We know that the neutralization enthalpy is about -114 kJ per 2 moles of H+ (since 2 H+ × -57 kJ/mol = -114 kJ).

But the formation of BaCl2 and BaSO4 also contributes to the enthalpy change.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered as a simple neutralization where all H+ and OH- are considered, regardless of the source.

In that case, the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal, so option A.

But none of the options exactly match -11.4 kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recheck.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M → 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M → 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ = 0.28, OH- = 0.2. So 0.2 H+ reacts.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than -11.4. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization includes the heat of solution of the solids, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, the reaction produces two moles of water per mole of H2SO4. So perhaps the calculation is based on the fact that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes two OH-.

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's calculate the total equivalents of acid and base.

Equivalents of acid = (0.1) + (0.09 × 2) = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Equivalents of base = 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 eq.

So the neutralization will proceed until 0.2 eq are neutralized, leaving 0.08 eq of acid.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 eq × (-57 kJ/eq) = -11.4 kJ.

Thus, the answer should be -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is option B (-11.42 kcal), which is the same as -11.4 kJ in kcal.

Wait, no. Let me calculate: 11.4 kJ = 11400 J. 11400 / 4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ = -2.72 kcal.

Ah, I see. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches the -11.4 kJ calculation.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be about -48.2 kJ.

Unless the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Maybe it's using -28.4 kJ per mole, which is about -6.8 kcal per mole. Then 0.2 × (-28.4) = -5.68 kJ, which is approximately -1.36 kcal. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the value of -13.6 kcal per mole (which is 57 kJ per mole). So 0.2 × (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A, -2.72 kcal.

But earlier I thought the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is around -48.2 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the reaction of all three solutions, where H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 and water, and HCl also reacts with the remaining Ba(OH)2.

Let me try that approach.

First, let's see how much Ba(OH)2 is available: 0.1 mol.

H2SO4 is 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4 in a 1:1 ratio (since each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two moles of H2SO4's H+? Or wait, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2.

So we have 0.09 mol H2SO4 and 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2.

They'll react in a 1:1 ratio, so 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

The remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol → 0.02 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- can react with HCl.

HCl (0.1 mol H+) reacts with 0.02 mol OH-, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized are 0.09 × 2 (from H2SO4) + 0.02 (from HCl) = 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, no. Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+; when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, all the H+ are used. So the 0.09 mol H2SO4 contributes 0.18 mol H+.

Then the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 mol) → 0.02 mol OH-.

These OH- react with HCl's H+ (0.1 mol). So 0.02 mol H+ reacts, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

So total H+ neutralized is 0.18 (from H2SO4) + 0.02 (from HCl) = 0.2 mol.

Thus, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ → -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is option A.

But why does option B exist? Perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering that the H2SO4 only donates one H+ for the neutralization, but that's not correct because it's a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the H2SO4 contributes both H+ in the reaction, but that complicates things further.

In any case, based on the initial calculation, the correct answer is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \), so total \( \text{H}^+ \) from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to produce 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - Total \( \text{H}^+ \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH}^- \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is present in smaller quantity, it is the limiting reagent. Only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) will react with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacting, the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}
     \]  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}
     \]

4. **Analyze the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This would correspond to \( -48.2 \, \text{kJ} \), which is inconsistent with the calculation.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** This corresponds to \( -15.8 \, \text{kJ} \), which is also inconsistent.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** This is higher than the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) and does not match.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**, as it aligns with the calculated enthalpy change.

Answer: A
