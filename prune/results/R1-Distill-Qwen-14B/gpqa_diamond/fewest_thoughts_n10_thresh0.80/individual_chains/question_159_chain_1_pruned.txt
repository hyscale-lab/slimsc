Okay, so I have this question about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I'm supposed to figure out the comoving distance to the quasar using the Lambda-CDM model parameters given. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that the peak wavelength of emission can tell us about the redshift of the object. Wait, but wait, the peak here is in the observed spectrum. Oh, because when the quasar emits light, the expansion of the universe stretches the wavelength, making it appear redshifted.

So the observed wavelength is 790 nm. But wait, quasars emit across the spectrum. Do I know where their peak emission is? Oh, right, I think quasars are powered by supermassive black holes and emit a lot of UV and optical light. So maybe the rest frame peak would be in the UV or optical. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the peak in the observed spectrum is due to some absorption line or something else. Or perhaps it's a broad emission line in the near-infrared, which would imply a certain redshift.

Wait, another approach: the drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm might be due to the Lyman limit or some other absorption feature. For example, the Lyman alpha emission line is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If that line is observed at 790 nm, then the redshift z would be (790/121.6) - 1 ≈ 6.5. But wait, I'm not sure if this is the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Balmer break. The Balmer series in hydrogen has lines that transition from higher energy levels to the n=2 level. The Balmer break is a drop in the spectrum at around 365 nm (H-alpha is about 656 nm, but wait no, H-alpha is in the optical. Wait, the Balmer break is actually when the Lyman series transitions stop. So the rest frame might have a peak in the UV, but when observed, it's shifted into the optical or infrared.

Wait, maybe the peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared. So if the quasar's rest frame peak is in the optical, say around 500 nm (green), then the observed wavelength is 790 nm. So the redshift z would be (790/500) - 1 = 1.58. Wait, but that's a moderate redshift, not extremely high.

But wait, I'm not certain about the rest frame. Maybe the peak is from the accretion disk in the rest UV. Another thought: the 'big blue bump' in quasars is a broad emission feature in the UV, which when observed from a high redshift would appear in the optical or near-IR.

But without knowing the rest wavelength, how can I find z? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question mentions the peak is at 790 nm, and flux drops below that. This might be a characteristic feature in the rest frame spectrum. For example, the peak might correspond to the Lyman limit (91.2 nm) in the rest frame, but that's in the far UV. So if observed at 790 nm, z would be (790/91.2) -1 ≈ 7.68. That's a high redshift. But would the flux drop below that? Maybe if the quasar's SED has a peak in the UV, the observed peak would be redshifted into the near-IR, and the flux at shorter wavelengths would drop because the SED is rising towards the peak.

Alternatively, another approach: the observed peak in the near-IR (790 nm) might be from the rest-frame optical or UV. If the rest frame peak is in the optical, then the redshift isn't so high. Let me think of the typical SED of a quasar. The UV part is prominent, so if we observe a peak at 790 nm, the rest frame might be at 130 nm (far UV), so z = (790/130) -1 ≈ 5.3. Or if the rest frame is about 500 nm (green), z = (790/500)-1= 0.58.

But I'm not entirely sure about the rest wavelength. Wait, maybe I should think about the drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. If the flux drops significantly below 790 nm, perhaps that's because the source's emission is dropping in that part of the spectrum. So the peak is at 790, which might be the peak of the source's rest frame emission. So for example, if the source's rest frame SED peaks in the optical, say around 500 nm, then observed at 790 nm would imply a
