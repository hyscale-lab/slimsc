Okay, I'm trying to answer this qPCR question. Let's see what the problem is.

So, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The qPCR efficiency was 100%, which is perfect because that means each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² was 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3. Hmm, I remember the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula is slope = log(e) / log(10), where e is efficiency. Since efficiency is 100%, e is 2. So log(2) is about 0.3, so the slope should be -3.3219... which is approximately -3.3. That makes sense because the slope given is -3.3, so that checks out.

Now looking at the Ct values. For each concentration, he has three technical replicates. The Ct values are:

100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2.
10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average ~31.
1,000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average ~27.6.
100: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Average 24.3.
10: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Average ~21.

Wait, but each tenfold dilution should change the Ct by about 3.3 cycles. Because at 100% efficiency, each tenfold dilution (like from 1000 to 100 copies) should decrease Ct by approximately 3.3 cycles.

Looking at the data, for each step:

From 10 to 100 copies per μl: Ct goes from 21 (average) to 24.3. That's a change of about 3.3 (24.3-21=3.3). Perfect.

100 to 1000: 24.3 to 27.6. That's a 3.3 change again.

1000 to 10,000: 27.6 to 31. Around 3.4, which is close enough considering some variation.

10,000 to 100,000: 31 to 34.2. Again about 3.2, which is about right.

So each dilution step (tenfold) causes a Ct change of roughly 3.3, which aligns with the slope. So the data looks consistent. But the question is about the discrepancies in his results.

Wait, the question says "Which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?" So perhaps the technical replicates are showing some variation, but is that a problem?

Looking at the technical replicates:

At 100000, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The differences are 0.3 between each. That's a range of about 0.6. Similarly, for 10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Again, each 0.3 apart, range 0.6. Same for the others. So the standard deviation within each replicate is about 0.3 each time.

Wait, but the options mention something about the deviation between technical replicates. Option D says the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. But in this case, the deviation (max minus min) between the replicates is 0.6 each time. Hmm, but I'm not sure. The standard deviation is around 0.2 or so (since each is about 0.3 apart on average). But in any case, the options may be pointing out that the Ct values are not following the expected trend, but in this case, they are following.

But looking at the options:

Option C says Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, each ten-fold dilution decreases the Ct by 3.3, which is correct. So the slope is -3.3, which is consistent with ten-fold leading to 3.3 cycle change. So that's correct, so option C's statement is wrong because the ten-fold is exactly 3.3. So C is not the reason for discrepancies.

Option D is about the technical replicates deviating more than 0.3. The data shows
