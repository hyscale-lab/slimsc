Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate. Wait, right, the enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta position of another carbonyl compound.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each requires determining the reactants and products. Let's break them down one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: It's the reaction of dimethyl malonate with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I think NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CHCH2COOCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, malonate is CH2(COO-)2. So dimethyl malonate is (CH3OOC)CH(COOMe)CH2COOEt? Hmm, maybe I should write it as CH2(COOEt)2. Or wait, no. Wait, no, malonate is CH2(COO-)2. So dimethyl malonate would be CH2(COOCH3)2. So that's the enolate source. When the base (NaOEt) is added, it deprotonates the alpha position, making the enolate.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but here it's 3-(p-tolyl). So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Or wait, no, the numbering might be different. Wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So replacing the CH2 with p-tolyl? Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would imply that the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, that canâ€™t be, because acrylate is only three carbons. Oh wait, maybe it's substituent on the double bond. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt, but in E configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is the COOEt group. The substituents on the double bond would be CH3 (from p-tolyl) and COOEt on opposite sides (E configuration).

So when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, which part? The enolate has the negative charge on the alpha carbon. The Michael addition is when the enolate attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta
