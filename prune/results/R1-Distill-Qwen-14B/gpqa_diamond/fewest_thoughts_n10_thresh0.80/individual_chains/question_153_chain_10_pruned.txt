Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct products of some Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each reaction step by step.

The problem has three parts: (A), (B), and (C). I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). NaOEt is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a strong enolate. The acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group at the 3-position. So the acrylate is actually CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or wait, no. Wait, the structure is E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl substituent on the beta carbon. So it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3?

Wait, maybe I should draw it. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but substituting the COOCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the adjacent carbon. Oh, wait, no. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure where the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a
