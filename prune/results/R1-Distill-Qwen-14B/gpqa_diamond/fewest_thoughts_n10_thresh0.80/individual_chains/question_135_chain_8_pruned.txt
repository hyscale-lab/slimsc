Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. The Lagrangian provided is L(y) = -λf ψ_f bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to determine which decay channels are possible at the lowest order.

Hmm, wait. So the first thing I should probably figure out is what this Lagrangian represents. The terms involving the fermion fields ψ_f bar and ψ_f suggest that this is a Yukawa interaction, right? Because Yukawa couplings usually involve a scalar field (like X here) interacting with fermions.

In Yukawa theory, the interaction term looks like g ψ ψ φ, where φ is the scalar field. So in this case, the interaction term would be λ f ψ_f bar X ψ_f, assuming v is the vacuum expectation value contributing to mass. But for decay purposes, maybe the v isn't as important because when X decays, the v is part of the mass term and not the interaction. Wait, but the mass of X is given as 6 GeV, which is probably the mass term in the Lagrangian, like (m_X^2 X^2)/2 or something. But the interaction term would be what allows the decay.

So, the decay of boson X would proceed through the interaction term. The fermion ψ_f must have a mass that is less than or equal to X's mass divided by 2. Because in a decay process like X → f f-bar, the energy available must be sufficient for each fermion to have at least their rest mass energy.

Wait, no, wait. The decay X → f f-bar would require that each fermion has a rest mass less than or equal to X's mass divided by 2. Because each fermion gets some energy, but the minimum each can have is their rest mass. So the condition is 2 m_f ≤ m_X.

So the allowed fermions are those with m_f ≤ m_X / 2. Since m_X is 6 GeV, m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, let me list the known fermion masses. I think the quark masses are as follows (in GeV):

Up quark (u): around 2 MeV, so negligible.
Down quark (d): ~5 MeV, also very light.
Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV, still very small.
Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV.
Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV.
Top quark (t): ~173 GeV, way too heavy.
For leptons:
Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV.
Muon (μ): ~105 MeV.
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV.
Others like the neutrinos have even smaller masses, but I think they can be ignored here.

So the fermions that satisfy m_f ≤ 3 GeV are:

e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c, b.

Wait, let me compute each:

Electron: 0.5 MeV → yes.
Muon: 105 MeV → yes.
Tau: 1.777 GeV → yes, because 1.777 is less than 3 GeV.
u, d, s, c, b.

Top quark is 173 GeV, way above 3 GeV, so no.

So the possible decay channels are X → f f-bar where f is any of these fermions.

But wait, the fermions in the interaction term. The Lagrangian has ψ_f; so which fermions are included? The question says the interaction is with fermions. So which fermions are present in the model? The problem doesn't specify, but in the Lagrangian, f could be any fermion, but in reality, the model would have specific interactions. Wait, but the problem says "the bosonic field X and fermions" in general. Hmm.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the index f is a sum over all the fermion types. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

b b-bar? Wait, m_b is 4.5 GeV, which is larger than 3 GeV. So 4.5 > 3, so X can't decay into b b-bar because each would need 4.5 GeV, but X is only 6 GeV. So 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV, so fermions can't have mass more than 3 GeV.

Wait, wait, this is a key point. Because if m_X is 6 GeV, the maximum possible mass for each fermion in the decay is 3 GeV. So the fermion mass must be ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's check each fermion:

Electron: yes.
Muon: yes (0.105 GeV <3 GeV).
Tau: 1.777 GeV, yes.
u: 2 MeV, yes.
d: ~5 MeV, yes.
s: ~100 MeV, yes.
c: ~1.5 GeV, yes.
b: 4.5 GeV, no.

So the allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Therefore, the decay channels are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, uū, ddbar, s sbar, c cbar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, e. Well, no, because b is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. So A is out because it includes b b-bar.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e. So this includes all the allowed fermions except b. So
