Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, maybe I misread that. Let me parse it again. It looks like it's an interaction term involving a scalar boson X. So the general form is something like Yukawa coupling, right? Because the Yukawa interaction is similar, where a scalar field couples to fermions.

In the standard model, the Yukawa interaction is what gives mass to fermions. Like, the Higgs field couples to fermions to give them mass, right? So here, maybe X is a scalar boson that couples to some fermions ψ_f, with a coupling strength λ and a vacuum expectation value (vev) υ.

So the interaction term would cause the boson X to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The decay products would be pairs of the same type of fermion since each ψ_f is a specific fermion. The allowed decay channels would depend on which fermions are present in the interaction.

But wait, the problem gives the interaction Lagrangian as L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe the f is a type of fermion? Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's written as L = -λ ψ_f^† (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Because usually, Yukawa terms have the form g ψ† ψ scalar. So perhaps it's λ times the product of the fermion fields and the scalar.

So assuming that, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it can couple to. The allowed decays are determined by the possible fermion pairs that X can produce. The possible decay products are pairs of fermions ψ_f where the mass is less than the mass of X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where the sum of the masses is less than 6 GeV can be produced. But wait, for a fermion-antifermion pair, the rest mass of each is m. So each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to 6 GeV/2 = 3 GeV. Because the invariant mass s of the pair must be less than or equal to X's mass squared.

Wait, but each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to (m_X)/2. Because when you decay, each fermion's energy will be at least its rest mass. So the threshold for decay is when the two fermions each have mass m, so 2m ≤ m_X. So m ≤ 3 GeV.

So what fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Let's list the known fermion masses:

Electron: negligible (<<1 GeV)
Muon: ~0.1 GeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Up quark: ~2.2 MeV (so about 0.002 GeV)
Down quark: ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
Strange quark: ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
Charm quark: ~1.275 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
Top quark: ~173 GeV
But wait, wait. I might have messed up some of the masses.

Wait, quark masses: current quark masses (approximate):

Up: ~2 MeV
Down: ~4
