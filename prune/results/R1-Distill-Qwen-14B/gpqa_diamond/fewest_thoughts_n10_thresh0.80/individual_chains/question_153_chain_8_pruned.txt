Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives three separate reactions, A, B, and C, and I need to figure out their products based on the reactants provided. Then, among the options A to D, I have to choose which set of products is correct.

Alright, let's start with the first reaction: A.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A

I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition between a nucleophile (enolate) and an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, dimethyl malonate is a diester, which is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other component is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester (since it's acrylate), so that should be the acceptor.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The Michael donor is the one that provides the nucleophilic enolate. So dimethyl malonate is the donor, and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor.

So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of the acrylate, you get a conjugate addition. The product should be a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha (from the enolate) and beta (from the acceptor) positions.

Let me visualize this. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. Its structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to CH2-CO2Me. Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2(CO2Me)2. So when it forms an enolate, one of the carbonyl oxygens deprotonates the central CH2, making a double bond between the two central carbons. So the enolate is the conjugate base, and it would attack the acceptor.

The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait. No, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 attached to p-tolyl? No, wait. Let me clarify: The formula for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C6H4-p-tolyl-OCH3? No, perhaps I should write it as CH2=CH-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, the "3-" in the name might refer to the position of the substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. Hmm, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, and the p-tolyl is at position 3, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So, it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. But wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, so maybe the p-tolyl is on the central carbon? Or maybe it's an alpha substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

So when the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, the addition occurs. The enolate would add to the double bond's beta position. So the product would be a new molecule where the enolate's R group (which is two methyl esters) is added to the acrylate's
