Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, image charges come into play. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so that might affect things.

The problem states that a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, each with a different expression.

I think the key here is to consider how the charge induces charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges can flow to or from the earth. So, when a charge q is placed near the sphere, it will induce an opposite charge on the sphere's surface. But wait, because it's grounded, the induced charge might stay on the sphere, or maybe the sphere's potential is zero.

Wait, the sphere being grounded means its potential is the same as the earth's, which is usually taken as zero. So the surface of the sphere is at zero potential.

Now, potential energy in such a system is typically the work done to bring the charges together. So when I bring charge q near the sphere, it does work against the electric field, but the induced charges on the sphere will also interact with each other and with q.

I remember that for a point charge near a conducting sphere, the induced charge distribution can be modeled using an image charge. The method of images might be useful here. But wait, in the case of a grounded sphere, the image charge method simplifies because the sphere's potential is zero.

So, the image charge approach: when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges can be represented by an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge's position and magnitude are determined such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, which it is because it's grounded.

The image charge q' would be located at a point along the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge q. The distance from the center would be such that the sphere's potential is zero. I think the image charge is proportional to q, and its position is determined based on the sphere's radius.

Wait, the formula for the image charge when a point charge is outside a conducting sphere is q' = - (R / d) q, where d is the distance from the center to the charge. Because the sphere's radius is R and the charge is at distance d from the center. So, the image charge is inside the sphere, at a distance R^2 / d from the center towards the charge.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The image charge for a sphere of radius R is at a distance of R^2 / d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from q. So if q is at distance d, then the image charge q' is at R²/d away from the center, towards the inside of the sphere. Because the sphere's radius is R, so the image point would be R²/d from center, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the potential energy due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting, the charges will distribute themselves to make the potential on the surface zero.

The potential energy U of the system can be considered as the work done to bring q to the
