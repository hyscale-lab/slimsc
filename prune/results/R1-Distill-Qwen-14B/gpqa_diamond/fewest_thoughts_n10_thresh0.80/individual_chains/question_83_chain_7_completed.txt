Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, dilution, right. So the concentration of acetic acid will change because we're adding more volume. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, so let's start by calculating the initial concentration after dilution. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³ because we added 20 cm³ water. So 0.05 * 20 / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid (a weak acid) in a neutralization reaction. The reaction equation is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find out how much moles of acetic acid are present, then find the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration, and then determine the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base after the reaction.

Wait, let me compute the moles. The initial volume of acetic acid after dilution is 40 cm³, right? So moles of acetic acid initially: M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

At 25% titration, moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. Since NaOH reacts in a 1:1 ratio, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing a mole of acetate ion.

So after reaction, moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume is now the original 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't give the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration. Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the volume change is negligible or we can consider the total volume as 40 cm³ plus the NaOH volume. But for a 25% titration, how much NaOH is added?

Wait, wait, let me calculate the equivalence point first. Maybe that will help me find out the volume of NaOH needed.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. Initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume is moles / conc. = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

At 25% titration, that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Wait, but maybe I should approach the 25% titration in terms of moles. Let's see: 25% of the moles needed for equivalence. So 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.

So, the reaction consumes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate. So:

Moles CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol
Moles CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol
Total volume = 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733 (since 1e-5 is 5, so 4.733).

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333

Log(0.3333) is approx -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26.

Now, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, what about the equivalence point? Hmm, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. The solution is a sodium acetate solution, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added are 10 cm³ (as calculated earlier). The total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Molarity of acetate ion is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Using Kb, we can find the pH. Since Kb is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.02.

The expression for Kb: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02)

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.483

pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517, which is approximately 8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is about 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, the options for A are 4.26 and 8.52. So that would match our calculations.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the equivalence point correctly? At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Kb is 5.405e-10, right. So:

Kb = x² / (0.02) → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6, pOH is about 5.48, pH is 8.52. That's correct.

Wait, but another approach for the equivalence point could be using the concentration of NaOH. Wait, no. At equivalence, it's all acetate, so the solution is sodium acetate.

Wait, but sometimes when dealing with weak acids and strong bases, the equivalence point can be above 7, which is the case here.

So putting it together, the pH at 25% is about 4.26, and at equivalence it's about 8.52. So the correct option is A) 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the 25% titration part. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So moles of acid left: 0.00075, acetate: 0.00025.

But the total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³=42.5 cm³. So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(0.005882/0.017647)
Which is log(0.3333) → which is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

pKa is 4.733, so pH = 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256 → about 4.26. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that when you dilute the solution, the concentrations are diluted, but when you add the NaOH, you are adding a certain volume, which affects the total volume. But I think I accounted for that.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach is to compute the pH without considering the volume change, but that's incorrect. No, I think I did it right.

So the first part, 25% titration, pH is 4.26. The equivalence point is 8.52. So option A is correct.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. So that's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the diluted acetic acid concentration. Let me check again.

Original volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. So concentration after dilution is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Another thought: when you add NaOH, the volume changes. At 25% titration, you added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations are correct.

Wait another thing: the equivalence point pH in the options is 8.52, which is what I got. So option A's equivalence is correct. So pH 4.26 and 8.52, so option A.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Oh, options are as follows:

A) 4.26; 8.52  
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00  
D) 4.57; 6.92

So option A is the one that matches my calculated values. But wait, in my initial calculation, the equivalence point was 8.52, which is what option A has. So why would the option D have different values?

Wait, maybe I messed up the 25% part. Let me think: perhaps I should have considered 25% of the solution's NaOH equivalence volume. So for 25% titration, the NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, but perhaps I should have considered the pH at that point.

Wait, another approach: the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. The pH before any titration can be calculated, but the question is about 25% titration.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the buffer solution. So at 25% titration, it's a buffer of acetic acid and acetate.

So, as I did earlier, the pH is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52.

So the correct answer should be A. But looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92, which is a different set of numbers.

Wait, did I miscalculate the equivalence point? Let me recalculate.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Kb is 5.405e-10. So Kb = x² / 0.02.

x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 → pOH is 5.48 → pH is 8.52. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial dilution is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the equivalence point but about the solution after adding 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration.

Wait, the total moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So 25% of that is 0.00025. So NaOH adds 0.00025 moles.

So, moles of HA: 0.00075, moles of A^-: 0.00025.

Concentration of HA: 0.00075 / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of A^-: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pKa is 4.733. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333.

Log(0.333) is -0.477. So pH is 4.733 -0.477 = 4.256 → 4.26. That's correct.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26 and at equivalence is 8.52, so option A is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches. So the correct answer is option A. Hmm, but according to the options, A is the first option. So why isn't it matching with any other options?

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Let me see: another way to find equivalence point pH is to calculate it using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The Kb is Kw/Ka = 1e-14/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-] = Kb.

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11 → x = √(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → approximately 5.48, so pH = 14 -5.48 = 8.52.

So that's correct.

Thus, the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence it's 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, containing \( 0.05 \times 0.02 = 0.001 \, \text{moles} \). After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are \( 0.001 \), so 25% of this is \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \). NaOH reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio, so \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \) of NaOH are added. After the reaction:

- Remaining moles of acetic acid (\( \text{HA} \)): \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \),
- Moles of acetate ion (\( \text{A}^- \)): \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \).

The total volume is now \( 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} \) (0.0425 L). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the ratio \( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333 \), we find:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion (\( \text{A}^- \)) in a total volume of \( 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} \) (0.05 L). The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, it is approximately 8.52. The correct answer is:
