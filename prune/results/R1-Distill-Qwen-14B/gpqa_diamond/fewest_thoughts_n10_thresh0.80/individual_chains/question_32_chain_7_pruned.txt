Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3, but the isotope is Li-6 or Li-7?

Wait, let me think. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6 because lithium has 3 protons. So 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

So I need to calculate the energy required for this nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Since it's a heavy ion collider, I think they're talking about relativistic speeds, so I'll definitely need to use relativistic formulas.

First, I should find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is given by E = mc², but I need the mass of the nucleus. For a nucleus, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, but maybe for precise calculation, I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, but I don't have exact values memorized. Maybe I can approximate. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me calculate that.

3 * 938 + 3 * 939 = 3*(938 +939) = 3*(1877) = 5631 MeV. But wait, that's just the sum, but the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less than that because of binding energy. The mass of Li-6 is about 6.017569 u, where u is the atomic mass unit. Oh wait, 1u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.017569 * 931.5 MeV would give the rest mass energy.

Wait, maybe I should calculate that. Let me compute 6.017569 * 931.5 MeV. Let's see, 6 * 931.5 is 5589. Then 0.017569 * 931.5 ≈ 16.35. So total is approximately 5605.35 MeV, which is about 5.605 GeV. But wait, that's the rest mass energy. 

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Is the rest mass of the nucleus the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy, or is it the atomic mass converted directly? Oh, right, the atomic mass includes electrons, but for a nucleus, we need to subtract the electrons. Hmm, wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.017569 u minus the mass of 3 electrons, maybe? Because a neutral lithium atom has 3 electrons. So each electron is about 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons would be about 0.001645 u. So the nucleus mass is about 6.017569 - 0.001645 = 6.015924 u.

Then, converting that to MeV: 6.015924 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ Let me compute that. 6 * 931.5 = 5589. 0.015924 * 931.5 ≈ 14.83. So total is 5589 +14.83 = 5603.83 MeV ≈ 5.6038 GeV.

So the rest energy is about 5.6038 GeV, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact number. Maybe I should look for the exact value or perhaps the problem expects me to use a certain approximation.

But perhaps the problem expects me to know the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as approximately 6 * 938 MeV /c², which is about 5.628 GeV, but wait, no, that's the sum of protons and neutrons, but real mass is less. So perhaps I can take the rest mass as approximately 5.6 GeV.

But maybe for the sake of this problem, I can use the exact value. Let me think. The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 6.017569 u, but wait, perhaps that's the atomic mass including electrons. Oh, right, the atomic mass includes electrons. So the nuclear mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons. So for Li-6, which has 3 electrons, the nuclear mass is:

6.017569 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u ≈ 6.017569 - 0.00164574 ≈ 6.015923 u.

So 6.015923 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015923 *9
