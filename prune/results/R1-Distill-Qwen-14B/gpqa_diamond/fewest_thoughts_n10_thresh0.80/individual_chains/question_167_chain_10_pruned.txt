Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, let's see. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I think I should first plug these into the formula for N. Let's compute sin(2phi) first. Since phi is -pi/4, 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1. Then I have exp(-2alpha²) which is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5). Let me compute that: exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So multiplying sin(2phi) and exp(-2alpha²), I get -1 * 0.6065 = -0.6065. 

So N squared is 1 + (-0.6065), which is 0.3935. So N is the square root of 0.3935. Let me calculate that. Square root of 0.3935 is about 0.6275. So N ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, but the normalization is done correctly, right? Because the general form for N in such superpositions is indeed that. So the state is normalized.

Now, the non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but wait a minute. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the best Gaussian approximation. Alternatively, I think the relative entropy measure is defined as S(rho || tau), where tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes this entropy difference. Oh but wait, the formula given is del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)].

Alternatively, sometimes the relative entropy is defined as
