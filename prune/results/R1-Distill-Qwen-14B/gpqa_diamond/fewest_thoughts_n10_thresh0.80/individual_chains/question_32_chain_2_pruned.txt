Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to accelerate a certain nucleus to a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity formulas, but let's think this through step by step.

First, the question says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, lithium normally has 3 protons. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so yeah, the mass number is 6. So the nucleus in question is ^6Li.

Next, the speed given is 0.96c. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use the relativistic equations rather than classical ones. So the energy of the particle isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's the relativistic energy which includes gamma, the Lorentz factor.

The formula for relativistic kinetic energy is K = (gamma - 1) * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed is 0.96c, plugging that into the formula will give me gamma.

Let me compute gamma first. So v = 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then, 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, what's that? Let me calculate: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me do that more precisely. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Therefore, K = (gamma - 1) * m c². Gamma minus 1 is 3.5714 - 1 = 2.5714. So K is approximately 2.5714 * m c².

Now, I need to find the mass of the ^6Li nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass of its constituent protons, neutrons, and electrons. But wait, wait. Wait, the nucleus is ^6Li, so it has 3 pro
