Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's lithium-6 because Li usually has 3 protons. Let me make sure: Li has atomic number 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6, so yeah, Li-6.

Wait, but wait. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So if Li normally has 3 protons, 3 neutrons would make it 6, so X is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

I need to find the energy of the nucleus when its speed v is 0.96c. I remember from relativistic mechanics that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared. So E = gamma * m c².

So first, I need to find gamma (the Lorentz factor) when v = 0.96c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

Let me plug in v = 0.96c into the equation. So v² is 0.9216 c². 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.078
