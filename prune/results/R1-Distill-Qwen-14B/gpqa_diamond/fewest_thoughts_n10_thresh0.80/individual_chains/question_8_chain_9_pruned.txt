Alright, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

Okay, the setup: we're looking for genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes—G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each: g1, g2, g3, and also double mutants g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. 

The experiment results show the resistance levels compared to the wild type. 100% is the control, meaning the wild type is fully resistant. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility. So, the mutants have varying levels of resistance.

Looking at the data:
- g1: 75% → still some resistance, but less than wild type.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So the wild type is 100%, so g2 is much worse.
- g3: 50% → halfway resistance.
- g1g3: 10% → very low, almost fully susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So when both g2 and g3 are knocked out, it's as bad as g2 alone.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone.

Hmm. Also, we know that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors regulate other genes, so they're like upstream in a signaling pathway.

What's the question again? Oh right, which conclusion about their interactions can we draw? The options are A, B, C, D.

I think the key here is to look at the epistatic relationships and see how the genes interact. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if mutation in gene A leads to a more severe phenotype than gene B alone, then A is epistatic to B. Or wait, I might have that backward. Let me think: if you have two mutations, and the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, the gene that's epistatic is the one whose mutation is 'upstream' in the pathway. Because changing the upstream gene masks the effect of the downstream gene.

So, for example, if gene B is downstream of gene A, then knocking out both A and B would have the same effect as just knocking out A. Because without A, B isn't activated anyway. So in that case, A is epistatic to B.

Looking at the data, let's see:

g1 has 75% resistance. So it's less than wild type but not completely susceptible.

g2 is 0%—so it's completely susceptible. That's worse than g1.

g3 is 50% resistance—so worse than wild type but not as bad as g1 and g2.

Now the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the plant is as susceptible as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is acting upstream of G1. Because without G2, G1's function doesn't matter anymore. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because knocking out G2 (which is upstream) in the double mutant makes the phenotype as bad as when G2 is alone.

Wait, but what's the situation with g1g3 and g2g3?

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. Because g1 is 75%, and g3 is 50%. So the double mutant is much worse. 

g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone. So knocking out both G2 and G3 gives the same as G2 alone. So that suggests G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. Because the double mutant doesn't go beyond the G2 single mutant.

Wait, but what's the effect of each gene. Let me think about the possible pathways.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed, leading to maximum susceptibility. 

So, in that scenario, g2 would have 0% (which it does). The double mutant g1g2 would be 0%, same as g2, because without G2, G1 isn't active anyway. Similarly, g2g3 would be 0% same as g2, because G3 isn't active without G2.

Now, what about the g1g3 double mutant? If G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but perhaps they have some other relationship. Let's see: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So the double mutant is 10%. That's much worse. So even without G1, G3's contribution is still needed. Or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So, without G2, both are inactivated. But without just one, the other can contribute. 

Wait, in the wild type, all three genes are functional. So if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in the wild type, G2 activates both G1 and G3. So in g2, neither G1 nor G3 are active. In g1, G2 is active, so it can activate G3. Hence, g1 would have G3 working,
