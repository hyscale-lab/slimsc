Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetry in molecules. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I need to remember what C3h symmetry entails. 

Wait, I think C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. C3h symmetry implies that the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis. So, the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that cuts through it.

Looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. I remember that triphenylene has a certain symmetry. Wait, triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three phenyl rings connected in a way that it's symmetric. It has a three-fold axis, right? But does it have the mirror plane needed for C3h? Or maybe C3v symmetry instead.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo linked to a trifuran structure... Wait, trifuran has a five-membered ring with three oxygen atoms? Or maybe it's a norbornene-like structure? Not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to a benzofuran system. But I'm not certain about its symmetry. Benzo systems usually have certain mirror planes, but I'm not sure if it's C3h here.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. The structure is symmetric because each isopropyl is the same. So, the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis? Let me think. Each isopropyl is symmetric, so when you rotate 120 degrees, they swap places. If there's a plane cutting through the boron and perpendicular to the direction of rotation, then yes, there's a mirror plane. So this molecule might have C3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bridge structure. It's a norbornane derivative. Wait, norbornane has a certain symmetry. Quinuclidine is a bridge structure with two bridgeheads. Does it have a three-fold axis? I think norbornane (which quinuclidine resembles) has a C2 axis because of the bridge. Alternatively, quinuclidine might have a higher symmetry. Let me visualize it: it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and perhaps a C2 axis. So maybe it doesn't have a C3h symmetry.

Wait, going back to the options. Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical substituents around a central atom. So, it definitely has a C3 axis. Does it have a mirror plane? Yes, because the molecule is symmetric across any plane that includes the central boron atom and is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, that would make it C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: C3h symmetry requires a horizontal mirror plane. So, the axis is in a certain direction, and the mirror plane is perpendicular to it. For example, in ammonia, which has C3v symmetry. If the mirror plane is present in the same molecule, then it's C3h.

But in triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is a three-carbon substituent. The molecule is trigonal around boron. So, when you rotate 120 degrees, the groups swap, and the molecule looks the same. Now, any plane that includes the boron and bisects between two isopropyl groups would be a mirror plane. So yes, that would give a σh plane. So, C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, does triphenyleno-based molecule have higher symmetry? Triphenylene itself has a three-fold axis, but does it have a mirror plane? Wait, triphenylene is a symmetric molecule. Looking it up in my mind, it's a tricyclic structure with three benzene rings arranged in a way that it's symmetric along three axes. So, perhaps it has a higher symmetry like D3h, which includes C3h plus other elements. But the question is about C3h, which is a subset of D3h.

Wait, but wait. If a molecule has D3h symmetry, then it certainly has C3h, because D3h includes all the elements of C3h plus more. So, for the question, any molecule with D3h symmetry would also have C3h. So, if one of the options has D3h symmetry, then it would be a correct answer.

So looking at option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. This sounds similar to a structure where triphenylene is fused with a trifuran. Wait, but triphenylene's base structure is symmetric, so if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it could have D3h symmetry. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the trifuran part breaks some symmetry.

Option B is benzo... I think it's a benzofused structure. Maybe that adds a mirror plane but not a three-fold axis. So, maybe C2h symmetry but not C3h.

Option D's quinuclidine. I think it has C2h symmetry because it has a mirror plane and a C2 axis. So, no C3h.

So, going back, which of the molecules has C3h symmetry? Triisopropyl borate (option C) has C3h. Triphenylene-based compound (option A) might have higher symmetry, but perhaps not if the substituents aren't symmetric. But wait, the question is which has C3h. So, any molecule with C3h is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which is a triphenylene derivative. Wait, but if the substituents are in a way that they break the mirror plane, then it might not have C3h. But without specific structural details, it's hard to say. 

Wait, another approach: which of these molecules is known for having C3h symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate is known for having C3h symmetry. It's a common example. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, quinuclidine has a bridge structure, which gives it a different symmetry. I think it's D3d or C2h. Wait, Quinuclidine's structure is like a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. The molecule is symmetric but has a plane of symmetry and a C2 axis, making its symmetry D3h? Or perhaps C2h? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the correct answer is probably triisopropyl borate. Because it's a trigonal planar around boron with three identical groups, so C3 axis and mirror planes, thus C3h.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the symmetry elements required for C₃h: a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to this axis. Each option is evaluated as follows:

### Option A:  
**Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
This molecule is based on a triphenylene core, which has a three-fold rotational axis. However, the trifuran substituents may disrupt the symmetry. Without explicit structural details, it is unclear if the molecule retains a horizontal mirror plane. It may have higher symmetry (e.g., D₃h), but this cannot be confirmed definitively.

### Option B:  
**Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. While it may have a mirror plane, it lacks a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). Therefore, it does not exhibit C₃h symmetry.

### Option C:  
**Triisopropyl borate**  
This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups, creating a trigonal planar geometry. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) perpendicular to this axis, making it a clear example of C₃h symmetry.

### Option D:  
**Quinuclidine**  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative with a bridge structure. It has a plane of symmetry and a C₂ axis, giving it C₂h symmetry, but it does not have a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). Thus, it does not exhibit C₃h symmetry.

### Conclusion:  
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that clearly exhibits C₃h symmetry due to its trigonal planar geometry with a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
