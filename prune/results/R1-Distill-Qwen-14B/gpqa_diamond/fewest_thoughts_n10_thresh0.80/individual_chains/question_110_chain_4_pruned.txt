Okay, so I've got this question about stars and two different spectrographs. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key here is the magnitude each spectrograph can observe. 

Hmm, from what I remember, apparent magnitude is how bright a star appears from Earth. The lower the number, the brighter it is. So ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, meaning apparent V magnitude less than 17. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, so apparent V less than 16.5 maybe?

Wait, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16" for HIRES. Oh wait, no: if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's a lower number. So, for ESPRESSO, m_v <17, and for HIRES, m_v <16. Because the brighter a star, the lower the magnitude. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be less than 16, because 16 is the stricter condition.

So each star's apparent magnitude is what I need to evaluate.

Let's look at each star.

Star1: absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. Since it's at 10 pc, its apparent V is the same as absolute, 15.5. So m_v=15.5. That's less than 16 and 17, so it's detectable by both. But wait, is that true? Because Star1 is at DEC -75. Since both observatories are in the southern hemisphere? Wait, Paranal is in Chile (southern hemisphere), so DEC of -75 should be visible. Keck is in Hawaii, which is about 19N, so DEC 55 (like Star2) is visible, but DEC -75 would be in the southern sky. Hmm, but the question says to disregard pointing limits and altitudes, so I don't need to worry about whether it's visible. So Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is
