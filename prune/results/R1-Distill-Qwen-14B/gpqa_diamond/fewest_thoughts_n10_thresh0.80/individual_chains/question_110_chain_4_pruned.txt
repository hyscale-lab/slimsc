Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are both high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations.

The question gives me five stars, each with different parameters: right ascension, declination, magnitude, distance, and some extinction values. The key here is to determine which stars are bright enough in the V band for both instruments to observe.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Because lower magnitude means brighter, right? So, only stars with V mag ≤16 can be detected by both, since HIRES can't go beyond 16.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes and some have apparent. Oh right, for the ones with absolute magnitude (M), I need to calculate their apparent magnitude using distance modulus. Oh yeah, distance modulus is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5, where d is distance in parsecs.

Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. So m = 15.5 +5 log10(10) -5. Log10(10)=1, so 5*1=5. So m=15.5 +5-5=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5 mag. So it's brighter than 17, yes for ESPRESSO. But HIRES only goes to 16. So 15.5 is ≤16, so HIRES can see it. So Star1 is observable by both.

Star2: mV=16.5, d=5pc. Wait, already it's given as apparent magnitude. So m=16.5. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.5 is okay. HIRES max is 16, so 16.5 is too faint for HIRES. So Star2 only ESPRESSO can see
