Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully. So, the question is about the reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, specifically Me2CuLi. The product is one of the four options given, and I need to figure out which one it is.

First, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack electrophilic sites. In epoxide ring-opening reactions, the cuprate will attack one of the carbons in the epoxide. The epoxide is a three-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. But wait, wait, no, an epoxide is an oxygen connected to two carbons in a ring. So in this case, the starting material is a disubstituted epoxide. Hmm, but wait, the molecule is given as (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So the 7-oxa part means there's an oxygen in the ring, making it bicyclic. Let me visualize this structure.

Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two rings. The numbering is a bit tricky, but I think the bridgehead is at position 1, 3, and 4. The substituents are methyl groups at 1, 3, and 4. The oxygen is at position 7, which is part of the bridge. So the epoxide is in a bicyclic system.

When an epoxide reacts with an organocuprate like Me2CuLi, the nucleophilic attack occurs. Organocuprates are known to perform a ring-opening of epoxides in a specific manner. From what I remember, the nucleophile (the cuprate's alkyl group) adds to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile adds. But wait, I should think about the mechanism.

Epoxide ring opening by organocuprates generally proceeds through a two-step process. First, the cuprate acts as a base, deprotonating the epoxide. Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, the cuprate could attack the less hindered carbon, similar to other nucleophilic ring-opening reactions. But wait, in
