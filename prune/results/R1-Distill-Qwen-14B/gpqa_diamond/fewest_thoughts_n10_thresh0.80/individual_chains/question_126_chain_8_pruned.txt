Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The task is to determine how many peaks appear in each chromatogram.

Let me read the reactions again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.

First, I need to figure out the products of each reaction.

Starting with Reaction I.

Compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Structure-wise, that's a six-carbon chain. The ketone is on C3, and there's a methoxy group on C5. The configuration is S, which might matter for stereochemistry in the product.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone group (C=O) at position 3 will become a CH(OH) group.

But wait, since the starting material is a ketone, after reduction, the product should be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, right? But wait, wait. Wait, when LAH is used, it's a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones, but what about other groups? The molecule has a methoxy group (OCH3) attached; LAH might not affect that. So, the main change is the ketone becomes an alcohol.

So, after LAH, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, hold on. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When you reduce the ketone, the configuration of the new stereocenter will depend on the starting configuration.

Wait, the starting ketone is at C3, so the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, maybe I should draw the structure correctly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is: CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-
