Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to understand it. The question is about finding the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in a solution. I remember that cobalt can form various complexes with thiocyanate ions, and the stability constants are given. Hmm, stability constants... right, those are the equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. Stability constants usually increase with the stability of the complex, but here β4 is 16, which is less than β3. So maybe the complexes are ordered differently?

I think the complexes are Co(SCN)ₙ²− where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So β1 is for the first complex, CoSCN²−, β2 for Co(SCN)₂²−, and so on. But I'm not entirely sure about the charge here. Wait, Co²+ with SCN^- would form complexes. Let me think: each SCN is -, so for Co(SCN)ₙⁿ−, the charge would be 2+ plus n*(-1) = 2 -n. So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for this calculation. Maybe the key is just the stability constants.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think dithiocyanato would be the one with two SCN ligands, so that's the Co(SCN)₂²− complex, which is the second complex. So we need to find the percentage of Co(SCN)₂²− in the solution.

The approach here is to calculate the distribution of the different cobalt species based on their stability constants. I remember that the fraction of each species can be calculated using the log of the stability constant and the concentrations. But how exactly?

I think the general formula for the fraction f_n of a complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β_n * [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n) / Σ (β_m * [Co²+] [SCN^-]^m) for m=1 to 4

Wait, but wait. The total concentration of cobalt is [Co_total] = [Co²+] + Σ [Co(SCN)_n²−]. So perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think.

Alternatively, the problem can be approached using the formation of complexes step by step. The formation starts with the first complex, then the second, and so on.

The general formula for the fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / (β_0 + β_1 [L] + β_2 [L]^2 + ... + β_4 [L]^4)

But wait, β_0 is 1 since
