Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to determine its chemical formula based on the data provided. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. So, the options have varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—if it's very broad, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually broader than in alcohols because of hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but the broadness might suggest something else.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, those are in the range for carbonyl groups. The 1700 is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe ester. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl like in an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone? Or maybe it's a carbonyl with some substituents that lower the wavenumber.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond. That's an important clue.

The Mass Spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what that could be. The molecular ion breaks down into fragments. So, the m/z 45 is a significant fragment. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether is 45, but wait, that's 45? Let me calculate. Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So (CH3)2O is 2*(12 +3*1) +16 = 2*(15) +16 =30+16=46. Hmm, so no. Wait, 45 could be something else. Maybe a CH2=CH-O group? Or maybe a ketone fragment? Or perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, think about common fragments. For example, the tropylium ion is m/z 91, so that's not it. Maybe a CH2 group plus something else.

Wait, another common fragment is the CH3-O- group. Wait, if the molecular formula is, say, C6H10O2, perhaps the molecule has an ester group. Esters often fragment to form an alkoxide ion, which could have a molecular
