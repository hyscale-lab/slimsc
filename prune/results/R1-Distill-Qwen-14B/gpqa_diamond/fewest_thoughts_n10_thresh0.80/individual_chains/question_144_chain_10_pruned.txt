Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mean decay distance for this meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, I think I need to find the lifetime of the meson. Oh wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime τ via the uncertainty principle. The formula I recall is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ should be ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, but units might be tricky here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Oh right, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, no, wait, I think I remember that when Γ is in GeV, τ is ħ / Γ, and ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s when Γ is in GeV.

Wait, let's get the units right. The decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately (6.582 / 0.
