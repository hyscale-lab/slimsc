Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters. I remember that the mean decay distance is related to how long a particle lives before decaying, which depends on its lifetime and velocity.

Wait, right, the mean decay length is given by L = γ * v * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and τ is the proper lifetime of the particle. But how do I find τ?

Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Since ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, but the units here are in GeV and MeV. Let me make sure I get the units right.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. I should convert that to GeV to match the units of ħ. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Now I need to find the velocity v. The particle's energy is E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c². So gamma γ is E / (m c²). Wait, but since we're working in natural units where c=1, this simplifies. So γ = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

Now, velocity v can be found using β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let me calculate 1/γ²: (1/ ( (8/1.2) ) )² = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887, and so v ≈ 0.9887c. Since c is 3e8 m/s, v is approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Next, the lifetime τ is 2.057e-24 seconds. The mean decay length is L = γ * v * τ. Let's compute each part step by step.

First, γ is 6.6667. Then v is about 2.966e8 m/s. τ is 2.057e-24 s.

So putting it all together: L = 6.6667 * (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.057e-24 s). Let me compute this.

Multiply 6.6667 and 2.966e8 first. 6.6667 * 2.966e8 ≈ around 1.984e9. Then multiply that by 2.057e-24.

Wait, 1.984e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.984 * 2.057) * 1e-15. Let's compute 1.984 * 2.057. Hmm, 2 * 2 is 4, but more accurately: 2 * 2.057 is 4.114, but 1.984 is almost 2, so 1.984 * 2.057 ≈ approximately 4.08.

So L ≈ 4.08e-15 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, perhaps I should do the calculations more accurately.

Wait, let me recalculate the steps.

First, let me compute τ more precisely. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that.

6.582 divided by 0.32. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 × 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 is 20.56875 times 0.32. Because 0.32 × 20 = 6.4, 0.32 × 0.56875 = 0.1819, which adds up to 6.5819. So yes, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 GeV·s / GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. So τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, compute γ. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So that's 6.666666...  So γ is 6.6666667.

Now, v: β = sqrt(1 - (1/(γ²))) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444))) ) because γ² is (6.6666667)^2 ≈44.4444. So 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Then sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.9887 squared is 0.9775. So β is 0.9887. So v = 0.9887 * c, where c is 3e8 m/s. So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, let's compute L = γ * v * τ. So γ is 6.6666667, v is 2.9661e8 m/s, τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.6666667 * 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

First, 6.6666667 * 2.9661e8 = ?

6.6666667 * 2.9661e8 = let's compute 6 * 2.9661e8 = 1.77966e9, 0.6666667 * 2.9661e8 ≈ (2/3)*2.9661e8 ≈ 1.9774e8. So total is about 1.77966e9 + 1.9774e8 ≈ 1.9774e8 is 0.19774e9, so 1.77966e9 + 0.19774e9 = 1.9774e9. So approximately 1.9774e9 m/s.

Wait, wait no, because I think I messed up the multiplication. Let me compute 6.6666667 * 2.9661e8.

Actually, 6.6666667 is
