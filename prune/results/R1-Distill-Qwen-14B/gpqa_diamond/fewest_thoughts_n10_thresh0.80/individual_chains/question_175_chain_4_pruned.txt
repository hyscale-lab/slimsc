Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It radiates at a wavelength λ, and in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ. The maximum power is given as A, and they want the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal with z-axis symmetry, maybe it's a dipole-like radiation but in a spheroidal form. Oh wait, but the exact form—like whether it's a dipole or quadrupole—might affect the radiation pattern.

In the case of a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator, right? So for a dipole, the maximum intensity is at θ=90 degrees. Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A. So maybe the maximum occurs at θ where sinθ is maximum? Or perhaps not, depending on the orientation.

Alternatively, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a certain dependence on θ. The intensity of the radiation from a dipole varies as (sinθ)^2 times some function of the wavelength and so on. So the power per unit solid angle would depend on sinθ squared.

Wait, let me think. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the dipole formula. The power pattern (intensity) for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, I think. So the maximum intensity would be when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. But that's for a dipole.

In this problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal, not a pure dipole. But maybe it's oscillating in such a way that the far field resembles a dipole radiation. Or perhaps it's a different mode, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is at θ=0 or 180 degrees for a dipole? No, no, that's when the dipole is aligned along the direction of observation. Oh wait, the dipole's radiation has a maximum at θ=90.

Wait no, wait. For a dipole, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole axis. So maximum intensity at θ=90°, and zero at θ=0° and 180°. So in that case, the intensity varies as sin²θ. So the maximum is when θ=90°, and the intensity is zero along the axis.

So if the problem is asking about the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30°, we can model it as the ratio of the intensity at that angle to the maximum intensity.

If the intensity is proportional to sin²θ, then the fraction would be (sin 30°)^2 / (sin 90°)^2. Because the maximum is at θ=90°, so that's 1. So sin30 is 0.5, so 0.5 squared is 0.25. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A, so the intensity at 30° would be (1/4) A. So the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, the options have 1/4 as option B and C. So the fraction is 1/4. Now, what about the form of f?

f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. For an oscillating dipole, the intensity (or power per unit solid angle) falls off with wavelength as λ^(-4). Because the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to (d^2φ/dt^2)^2, and the far field intensity goes as (λ^(-4)) since E is proportional to (1/r) and r is proportional to λ, so E ~ 1/(λ), and the intensity is E^2, but multiplied by other factors that may bring in more λ dependencies.

Wait, let me think again. The intensity of the radiation from a dipole is given by:

I = ( ( μ0 / (4π) ) * ( p0^2 ω^4 ) ) / ( c^3 r^2 ) ) * sin²θ

Wait, but in the radiation zone, the far field approximation, the intensity typically falls as 1/r^2, which is like λ^4 since λ is inversely proportional to r (assuming r >> λ). Hmm, wait: in the far field, r ~ λ, so 1/r^2 ~ 1/λ^2. But wait, the intensity is proportional to E^2, and E itself is proportional to (ω^2 p) / (r c^2), where ω is the angular frequency and p is the dipole moment. So E ~ (ω^2 p) / (c^2 r). Squaring that gives E^2 ~ (ω^4 p²) / (c^4 r²). Since ω = 2π c / λ, ω^4 is proportional to (1/λ^4). So E^2 ~ (1/λ^4) * (1/r²). But since in the far field, r ~ λ (as r ≫ λ is the condition, but perhaps in the radiation zone, r is proportional to λ?), so 1/r² ~ 1/λ². So E^2 ~ 1/λ^4 * 1/λ^2 = 1/λ^6. Wait, but that would mean
