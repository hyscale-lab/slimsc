Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere is related to the temperature. I think it has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38... that sounds familiar. Oh yeah, Boltzmann's constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. But wait, no, actually, the energy levels are quantized, and the probability of an atom being in a higher energy level depends on temperature. The Boltzmann factor comes into play here.

The excitation level is higher when the temperature is higher. Because higher temperatures make atoms more energetic, so more likely to be in higher energy states. So if star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms, its temperature must be higher than star_2's.

The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But I think in this problem, we can assume that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars because it's the same element and same energy levels, so g_upper/g_lower would be 1. So the ratio simplifies to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) for each star.

Wait, wait, but the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the ratio N_1/N_2 is 2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited." So the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (N1_upper)/(N2_upper) = 2? Or maybe it's the ratio of N_upper/N_lower for each star. Let me think.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So perhaps the ratio
