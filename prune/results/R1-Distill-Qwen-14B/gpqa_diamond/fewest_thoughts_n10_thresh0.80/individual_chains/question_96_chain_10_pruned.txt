Alright, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my black hole thermodynamics, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

Okay, the question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula, I think, is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, maybe it's S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), but I'm not sure about the exact constants. Oh well, the exact constants might not matter since we're looking for an order of magnitude.

First, I need to find the radius of the event horizon. The angular size θ (in radians) relates the radius R to the distance d through the formula θ ≈ R/d (since θ is very small, the approximation θ ≈ tanθ ≈ sinθ holds). So R ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. I should convert that to radians first. Oh right, because the formula uses radians. So θ_radians = θ_degrees * (π/(180)).

Let me calculate θ in radians. θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1e-17 * 1.745e-2 ≈ approximately 1.745e-19 radians.

Then, R = θ_rad * d. d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, I need to convert parsecs to meters because the standard units for these formulas are in SI units.

One parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So R ≈ (1.745e-19 rad) * (3.0857e26 m) ≈ 1.745 * 3.0857e7 meters. Let me calculate that: 1.745 * 3.0857 ≈ 5.37. So R ≈ 5.37e7 meters, which is about 5.37e7 m.

Wait, but wait. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by 2 G M / c². So the area A is 4 π R_s². Alternatively, since R = R_s / 2, because the Schwarzschild radius is 2GM/c², wait no, wait: the event horizon radius R is actually R_s = 2 G M / c². So the radius R is the Schwarzschild radius. So the area A is 4 π R².

But let me get that straight. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2 G M / c², so the area A = 4 π (R_s)² = 4 π (2 G M / c² )².

Wait, but first, perhaps I should calculate R using the given θ and d. So R ≈ 5e7 meters. Let me check that calculation again. θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * pi/180 radians. So 1e-17 * (3.1416/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then R = θ_rad * d. d is 1e10 parsec in meters: 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m. So R = 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 ≈ (1.745 *3.086) * 1e7 m. 1.745 *3 ≈5.235. 3.086 is about 3.086, so 1.745 *3.086 ≈ 5.37. So R ≈5.37e7 m. So R is around 5.37e7 meters.

Wait, that's 5.37e7 meters, which is 5.37e4 kilometers. Hmm, that's a big radius. Let's see, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2 G M / c², so M = (R c²) / (2 G).

But perhaps I don't need the mass because the entropy formula can be written in terms of R_s. Let me recall the entropy formula. Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, let me confirm the formula. Yes, S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). So the constants are involved, but for order of magnitude, maybe I can ignore the constants and focus on the factors of A, given the constants are known.

So A = 4 π R^2. R is 5.37e7 meters, so A =4 * pi * (5.37e7 m)^2. Let me compute that. 5.37e7 squared is (5.37)^2 * 1e14 = about 28.8 * 1e14 = 2.88e15 m². Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416≈12.566. So 12.566 * 2.88e15 ≈ 36.27e15 m², which is 3.627e16 m².

Wait, but wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let's compute R^2.

R = 5.37e7 m, so R^2 = (5.37e7)^2 = (5.37)^2 *1e14 = 28.8369e14 = 2.88369e15 m².

Then A =4 * pi * R² = 4 * 3.1416 * 2.88369e15 ≈ 12.5664 * 2.88369e15.

Let me compute 12.5664 * 2.88369e15: 12 * 2.88369e15 is 34.604e15; 0.5664 *2.88369e15 ≈ 1.637e15. So total approximately 36.241e15 m², which is 3.6241e16 m².

Now, plug into the
