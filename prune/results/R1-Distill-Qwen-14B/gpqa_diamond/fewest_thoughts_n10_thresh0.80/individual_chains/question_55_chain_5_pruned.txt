Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm, I remember that acetates are esters, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, wait. No, acetate esters are R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no, acetate is R-OAc, where Ac is the acetyl group. So, the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. Right.

The compounds in the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. So the R group is either propenyl or butenyl, with either cis or trans configuration. Let me think about the structures.

Propenyl would be CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, propenyl is CH2CHCH2? No, wait, propenyl is like CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is it CH2CH2OAc with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no. Let me get the structures right.

Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- as the R group. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or maybe something else. Wait, butenyl would have four carbons. Let's think about the structures of the options.

Cis-propenyl acetate would have the double bond in the propenyl group. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but the substituents on either side of the double bond are in cis configuration. Wait, but in propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, in propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, but if it's propenyl, the double bond is at position 1, between C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structures. Let me think: all four options are either propenyl or butenyl esters.

The NMR data given is:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Wait, let's think about what these signals could mean. The acetate group would have a methyl (CH3) group attached to the carbonyl. That's the 2.1 ppm singlet (s) because it's a methyl group with no neighboring protons. So that's the OAc group.

The other signals are from the R group, which is either propenyl or butenyl. Let's consider if it's a propenyl group.

For an allyl group, the protons adjacent to the double bond would typically show up around 5-5.5 ppm. Also, the coupling between protons on the double bond would be around 15-17 Hz, which is consistent with the doublet at 7.0 ppm (
