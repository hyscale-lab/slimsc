Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. Oh, but wait, that's the speed in the rest frame of the medium, right? Because when the medium is moving, like if the glass is moving, then the speed observed would be different due to the relative motion.

Wait, so in the lab frame, the glass is moving at speed v. The light is moving through the glass, so its speed in the glass is c/n. But since the glass itself is moving, how do I combine these velocities?

I think this is a case where I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the speeds involved might not be negligible compared to c (even though in this case, maybe v is small, but I don't know the specifics). Wait, but the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement, towards the observer.

Wait, so in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. From the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass's frame at velocity v, how does that affect the observed speed?

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, in this case, the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. The lab would measure the speed u' as (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, wait, but direction matters. Since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction (same direction as the glass's motion), then in the glass frame, the light is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So when you transform to the lab frame, you add the velocities.

So substituting into the formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/
