Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. Oh, and c is 1 here.

Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed depends on the medium's index of refraction. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? So normally, without any movement, the speed would be 1/n, since c is 1.

But wait, the glass is moving. So the situation involves a medium that's moving relative to the observer. I think this is a scenario where special relativity might come into play. Or maybe it's just a matter of relative velocities in classical mechanics? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think.

In classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, and light is moving at v_light in the glass (which is 1/n in the glass's rest frame), then maybe from the lab frame, the speed would be v_light + v. But wait, that can't be right because when you're dealing with light, you can't just add velocities classically because it would exceed c in some cases, and relativity says nothing can go faster than c.

Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So the light's speed in the glass is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, what would the speed be?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when you have velocities moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical addition; you need the relativistic formula.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, here u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, but wait, the speed of light in the glass's frame is u = c/n. Because in the rest frame of the glass, light propagates at speed c/n.

So
