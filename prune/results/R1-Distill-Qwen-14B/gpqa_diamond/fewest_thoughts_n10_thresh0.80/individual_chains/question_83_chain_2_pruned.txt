Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and the pH changes depending on how much base has been added.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, so first, when you mix 20 cm³ of acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration will change because the volume increases. But before the titration, the diluted solution's concentration is important. Let me calculate that.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. So, 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles divided by volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got that.

Now, during titration with NaOH, which is a strong base, it'll react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, what's the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence? The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001. The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So, moles = Molarity × Volume → 0.001 = 0.1 × V → V = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So, equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So, 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me think about the two cases: 25% and equivalence.

First, the 25% point. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M × 0.0025 L (2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L) = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, we'll have some acetate ions (CH3COO^-) formed.

So, initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001. Moles reacted: 0.00025. So remaining CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but the solution's volume has increased. We need to calculate the new concentration of both CH3COOH and CH3COO^-.

The total volume is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO
