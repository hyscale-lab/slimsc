Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, okay, let's see what the question says. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe after working it out, I can match my results to one of them.

First, I should recall that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they'll form acetate ions and water. The reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

Okay, let me break this into parts. Part one is the initial dilution. Initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. I need to find the new concentration after dilution.

Wait, the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1 * V1)/V2. Plugging in the numbers, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So 0.05 * 20 /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Now, when we start titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles. Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, no, the initial solution after dilution is 0.02
