Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the larger the wobble, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the main difference seems to be the Doppler shift observed for each star. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but why does a bigger shift mean something different?

Wait, I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula I recall is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * sqrt(1 - e²)) )^(1/3) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term goes away. And because the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass (since M_p << M_*), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so I can probably ignore M_p in the denominator.

Wait, actually, the standard formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ). But since e is zero and M_p << M_*, this simplifies. Let me think about the simplified version.

Alternatively, I remember the simplified relation: K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( ( (M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (P * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) )^(1/3) )

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to think differently. The RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

Assuming that M_p << M_*, so (M_* + M_p) ≈ M_*, and sin i is approximately 1 (since the orbit is edge-on, which is the best case). So, K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) c^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_*))^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, the denominator is approximately 1, so K is roughly proportional to (M_p / M_*) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think about the formula again.

The correct formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P * sqrt(1 - e²)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to find the relationship between K and the orbital period.

Let me look for a formula that relates K and the period P, given that the masses are the same for the stars and the planet masses are similar.

Wait, another approach: since both stars have the same mass (M) and the planets have similar masses (m), the ratio of their semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) can be found using the formula for K.

K is proportional to ( (m) / (M^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me get the exact formula. I think the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1)/( (P (1 - e²))^(1/3) )

But since e is zero and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K = ( (G M_p ) / (M_*^(2) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P))^(1/3) ) * ( 1/(2π) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compare the two planets, since M_* and M_p are the same for both. Let me denote M_* as M, and M_p as m for both.

So, for Planet 1: K1 = (something) * (m / M^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = (something same) * (m / M^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

So, the ratio K1/K2 is [ (1/P1^(1/3)) ] / [ (1/P2^(1/3)) ] ] = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but the problem states that K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7 milliangstrom. So K2 > K1. Because K is larger when the velocity is higher, which happens when the planet is closer. Because closer planets have shorter orbital periods. So, if K is higher, the period is shorter.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. The RV semi
