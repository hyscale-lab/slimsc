Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both stars are like our Sun. The planets have circular orbits. So the main difference is in the RV shifts: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, what determines the size of the Doppler shift? I think it's related to the mass of the planet and its orbital period. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude, K, which is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance.

The formula for K is K = (v * (M_planet) ) / (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * ( (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star) ) )^(1/3), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's. So M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies. 

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K can be calculated using the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) / c

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. Also, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ [ (G * M_planet ) / ( M_star * P^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π/P)^(1/3) ) / c.

Wait, maybe I should think about the dependence of K on the orbital period and planet mass.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_planet/M_star) )) )^(1/3). But again, since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, that term is negligible, so K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) / (P)^(1/3).

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, K scales with ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/2) * ( (2π G ) / P )^(1/3) ) ) / c.

But since both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and their stars have the same mass, and e=0, and the same sin i (since we have a detection), the main variables are P and the Doppler shift K.

Wait, wait, but in the problem, the RV shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So K is proportional to the RV shift (since K is the velocity semi-amplitude, and the measured shift would be K multiplied by some factor depending on the wavelength and instrument, but for the same spectral line and same setup, the shift in wavelength would be proportional to K). So if planet #1's shift is 5 and planet #2's is 7, perhaps K1/K2 = 5/7.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is related to the velocity via the formula:

Δλ / λ0 = v / c,

where v is the velocity, λ0 is the rest wavelength, and c is the speed of light.

So the measured shift (in milliangstroms) is proportional to the velocity amplitude K. So for the same spectral line, same star, same setup, the milliangstrom shift is proportional to K. So if planet #2's shift is larger, that means K2 > K1.

Wait, but K is the velocity of the star due to the planet. So K would be higher if the star is moving more, which could be due to a more massive planet or a closer-in planet (smaller orbital period), because the planet's gravitational pull would cause a larger wobble.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have the same mass. So the difference must be due to the orbital periods, right? Because K depends on the orbital period.

So let's get back to the formula. Since the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star
