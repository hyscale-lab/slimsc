Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time when a charge is moving.

Alright, the setup: there's a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. The velocity at the field generating time tr is v.

So, I remember that potentials are related to the fields through Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. The fields are E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t and B = ∇×A.

Wait, but for a moving charge, the potentials can be more complicated because of the motion. Oh right! When charges move, you have to consider the retarded time because the fields at a point are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

The scalar potential for a moving charge... Hmm, I think it's given by something like V(r, t) = (q / (4πε₀)) * [1 / (r - (v/c) (t - tr)))] or something along those lines, but wait, maybe it's in terms of the position where the field was generated. Oh wait, in the problem, d is the vector from the field generating point to r. So d would be r - r', where r' is the position of the charge at time tr. So r' is the position at time tr.

Wait, let me get this straight. The field generated at time tr ( retarded time) will be observed at a later time t. So d is the vector from r' (the position at tr) to r, so d = r - r'.

But maybe I should think in terms of the Lorentz gauge or something. Or maybe the potentials are given by the Liénard potentials.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by V(r, t) = (q / (4πε₀)) * [1 / (|d| - (v · d̂)(t - tr)/c)] )? Or was it |d| + something? Hmm, no, because the charge is moving, so when you're looking at the potential at time t, the charge's position was at tr, so the light travel time is the difference.

Wait, more accurately, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1 / |r - (r' + v (t - tr))| ].

Wait, no, because r' is the position at tr, and the charge moves with velocity v. So the position at time t would be r' + v (t - tr), but when considering the potential at (r, t), it's as if the charge was at r' + v (t - tr) at time tr. Hmm, maybe that's not the right
