Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem gives me three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I'm supposed to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I'll have to pay attention to units.

Wait, wait. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. For strong acids and bases, it's often around -57 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure if that's exactly applicable here because the problem gives specific concentrations and volumes. Maybe I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions to see which one is the limiting reactant.

First, let's break down each solution into their ions.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-. So, moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). For 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl. That gives 0.1 mol of H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, actually H2SO4 first dissociates into H+ and HSO4^-. The second dissociation, HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, isn't complete, but for strong acids, maybe I can assume both protons are released. Alternatively, sometimes only the first is fully dissociated. Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first dissociation. The second is weaker, but in dilute solutions, the second H+ might not dissociate as much. Hmm, but the problem is about neutralization, so probably looking for the total H+ available from the acid. But I'm getting confused. Since it's 0.3 M H2SO4, each mole gives two H+? Or just one? Because H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H, but the second is weaker. But in neutralization, perhaps both H+ are considered as available. Hmm, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that both H+ are released.

Wait, no. Wait, for the purposes of neutralization, H2SO4 as a diprotic acid. So, each mole of H2SO4 would provide 2 moles of H+ ions. So, moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. So, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^- ions. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. So, OH^- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, the total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. HCl gives 0.1 mol H+. H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+. So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

The OH^- is from Ba(OH)2, which is 0.2 mol.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+
