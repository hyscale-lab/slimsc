Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

I remember that cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. The key idea is that the particles spiral outwards as they gain energy, and the magnetic field keeps them moving in a circular path. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, but they have a different way of applying the electric field, right? Instead of a fixed frequency, the electric field's frequency changes as the particle's speed increases. That way, the particle stays in sync with the electric field for continuous acceleration.

The problem says that a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy at t=0, and it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. Wait, why two accelerations? Oh, maybe because the electric field alternates, so each half-cycle provides a push? Or perhaps it's about the number of times the voltage is applied? I'm not sure yet.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So U0 is 190 kV, and Φ0 is π/4. Hmm. The question is how many revolutions the proton makes.

I think I need to calculate the number of times the proton completes a full orbit in the synchrocyclotron before reaching the desired kinetic energy. But how?

Wait, the kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV. Protons are non-relativistic or relativistic here? Let's see. At 950 MeV, that's about 950 million electron volts. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So this is a relativistic problem because the kinetic energy is comparable to the rest mass. Oh, that changes things. So I can't use the non-relativistic formulas.

In a cyclotron, the magnetic field determines the radius of the orbit, but as the particle gains energy, its velocity increases, so the radius increases. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field varies to keep the particles in sync, right? So the frequency ν(α) probably depends on the speed of
