Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

Starting with the first reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, okay. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this is probably an enolate formation reaction. 

So, the starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that. The ketone is at position 1, and the substituents at position 2 are ethyl and methyl, and at position 6, another methyl. Wait, no, wait. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C1. Then at C2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group attached, and at C6, another methyl. So the substituents are: C1: ketone (O), C2: ethyl and methyl, C6: methyl.

Now, when t-BuOK deprotonates a ketone, it usually forms the more substituted enolate. But wait, the ketone is at C1. So the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. Let me think about where the base would abstract a proton. The base is t-BuOK, which is bulky, so it prefers less hindered sites. So which alpha position is less substituted?

In the molecule, C2 has two substituents (ethyl and methyl) and is adjacent to the ketone. C6 has a methyl group. So C2 is more substituted. But wait, the base is bulky; it would prefer to take a proton from a less hindered position. So perhaps the enolate would form at the less substituted position. Wait, but the enolate formation depends on the stability too. The more substituted enolate is more stable, but the bulky base might prefer the less hindered site.

Wait, the enolate can form either at C2 or C6. Let me think about their positions. C2 is adjacent to the ketone and has two substituents. C6 is on the opposite side of the ring (since in a cyclohexane ring, C1 is next to C2 and C6). So when t-BuOK abstracts a proton, which site is less hindered?

Alternatively, perhaps the major enolate is the more substituted one, but if the base can't reach due to steric hindrance, it might choose the other. Hmm.

Wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ring has substituents at C1 (ketone), C2 (ethyl and methyl), and C6 (methyl). When the base abstracts a proton alpha to the carbonyl, it can abstract from C2 or C6. Let's think about the positions.

At C2, the alpha carbon is attached to ethyl, methyl, and the ring. The hydrogen
