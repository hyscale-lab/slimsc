Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can vibrate and rotate, and their energy states are quantized. The question is about what momentum a photon should have to cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the ground state. So, I need to figure out the transition to the next state. But wait, the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Or maybe the question is considering both?

The options are giving momenta, so I guess I need to calculate the energy difference between the initial and final states and then find the corresponding photon momentum.

The molecule has atoms X and Y with masses 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the problem says the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, no, the rigid rotor model is for rotation where bond length doesn't change, but the non-rigid rotor allows bond length fluctuations, possibly coupling rotational and vibrational states. But maybe that's beyond what I need right now.

Alternatively, maybe the model refers to the combination of rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the molecule's energy is a combination of both rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. In quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is usually the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational state and vibrational state are coupled, but in some models, they're considered separately. Or perhaps in the rigid rotor, the possible states are (v, J), and the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is (v=0, J=0), what is the next lowest state it can go to when absorbing a photon? The next state would be either increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0) or increasing J by 1 (v=0, J=1). But which transition requires less energy, so the photon with the least energy needed would be the one with a lower momentum.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so the next state with the lowest energy would be the one where the energy increase is the smallest. So we need to compute both possible transitions and see which one requires less energy, then find the photon momentum for that.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the next state is the first excited state, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational states. But I think the energy levels are such that the vibrational transitions have higher energy than rotational. Because in a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are spaced much more widely than rotational ones. So the energy difference for a vibrational transition (Δv=1) is much larger than for rotational (ΔJ=1). Therefore, the lower energy transition would be the rotational one.

Wait, let me think about the energies. The vibrational energy levels are given by Ev = (v + 1/2) h ν. The energy difference when v increases by 1 is h ν. The rotational energy levels are EJ = [J(J+1)] h c / (4π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would be EJ=1 - EJ=0 = ( (2)(3) - 0 ) * [h c / (8 π² I) ] = (6 h c)/(8 π² I) = (3 h c)/(4 π² I). Wait, no, perhaps I should recalculate.

The general formula for rotational energy levels is E_J = (J (J+1) ) * (h²)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E1 - E0 = [ (2)(3) - 0 ] * (h²/(8 π² I)) )? Wait, no. Let me compute E_J for J=0: E0 = 0.

For J=1: E1 = [1 * 2 ] * (h²/(8 π² I)) = 2 h²/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

Wait, so the energy difference ΔE_rot = E1 - E0 = h²/(4 π² I).

The vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib = h ν.

So which of these is smaller? If ΔE_rot < ΔE_vib, then the rotational transition would require a lower energy photon.

So I need to compute both ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib, and see which is smaller.

Given the data:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) amu.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

Mx = 20, My = 2. So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, to compute I, the moment of inertia is I = μ r², where r is the bond length.

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ * r².

Wait, μ in kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Wait, wait no, wait. Let me compute that again.

r is 2 angstroms --> 2 * 1e-10 m = 2e-10 m.

So r^2 is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

μ is 20 * 2 / (20 + 2) amu = (40 / 22) amu = 20/11 amu = approx 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's calculate:

1.818 * 1.6605 = approx 3.015. So μ ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² I).

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

So h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

4 π² I = 4 * (9.8696) * 1.206e-46 ≈ 4 * 9.8696 = approx 39.4784; 39.4784 * 1.206e-46 ≈ 4.76e-45.

So ΔE_rot = (4.39e-67) / (4.76e-45) ≈ (4.39 / 4.76) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.922 * 1e-22 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Now compute ΔE_vib = h ν.

ν is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h ν = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 s^-1 = 2.65e-19 J.

So ΔE_rot is 9.22e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two, 9.22e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

Therefore, the molecule would need to absorb a photon that provides the energy difference for the rotational transition, i.e., 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, because photons carry momentum p = h / λ, and also E = p c. Alternatively, since E = pc for photons (because their mass is zero), so p = E/(c).

So, p_photon = ΔE / c.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's a very small momentum. Let me check the calculations again because the options given are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia or the energy difference.

Wait, let me re-calculate I:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

μ in kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Yes, correct.

Then ΔE_rot = h² / (4 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 * π^2 * 1.2064e-46).

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 squared is approx 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 4 * π² ≈ 39.478.

39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.65e-45? Wait, 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 = let's calculate:

39.478 * 1.2064 = approx 39 * 1.2 is about 46.8, but more accurately:

39.478 * 1.2064 = let me compute step by step:

39 * 1.2064 = 46. 9996 (approx 39 * 1.2=46.8, but 39 * 0.0064 is 0.2496. So 46.8 + 0.2496 = 47.0496.

0.478 * 1.2064 = approx 0.478 *1.2=0.5736, 0.478 *0.0064≈ 0.003075, so total ≈ 0.5767. So total denominator is 47.0496 + 0.5767≈ 47.626e-45? Wait no, because 4 π² I is 39.478 *1.2064e-46. So 39.478 *1.2064e-46 = 47.626e-46? Wait, 39.478 *1.2064e-46 is 47.626e-46? Wait, 39.478 * 1.2064 is 47.626, so 47.626e-46.

So denominator is 47.626e-46 = 4.7626e-45.

So ΔE_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.7626e-45 = (4.39 /4.7626) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J. Same as before.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But wait, none of the options are anywhere near this. The options are about 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Oh! Wait a second, because 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Where did I go wrong? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I confused the selection rules. In the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions require a change in J by ±2, because the photon's angular momentum is quantized in units of ħ. Oh wait, because the photon has an angular momentum of ±ħ, so ΔJ can only be ±1 for a dipole transition. Wait, I'm getting confused.

No, wait, for rotational transitions in molecules, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So the transition from J=0 to J=1 is allowed.

But wait, perhaps I mixed up the energy levels. Let me think again.

Wait, but wait, maybe the energy difference for the next state isn't just a rotational transition. Because the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. The next possible state would be the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (v=0, J=1).

Wait, but earlier I calculated the rotational energy difference as 9.2e-23 J and the vibrational as 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon needed for the rotational transition has much lower energy.

But the options are all about 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, which is higher than what I'm getting. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy in terms of w (angular frequency), as given. Alternatively, maybe the model combines both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the given angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. That's probably the vibrational frequency, ν = w/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.28) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz. But I'm not sure if that's relevant for the rotational part.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground state, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state, which would require a photon of energy h ν. So p = h ν / c. Let me compute that.

h ν = h * (w/(2π)) = (6.626e-34 J s)(4e14 rad/s)/(2π) ) = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(6.28) ≈ (2.65e-19)/(6.28) ≈ 4.21e-20 J.

Then p = 4.21e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) = 1.4e-28 kg m/s = 1.4e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. However, earlier calculation for the rotational transition was 3e-31 Ns, which is much smaller than any options. But the options don't have anything near that, so perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which transition is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the simultaneous change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from the ground state to the first excited state in either vibration or rotation, whichever is higher in energy.

Wait, but the question states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest energy increment. So rotational transition requires less energy. So why isn't the answer the rotational one?

But the options don't include 3e-31 Ns. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the lowest vibrational state but with the lowest rotational state for that vibrational level. So from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1). But that would be the rotational transition.

Wait, but maybe the model is considering the non-rigid rotor, which I'm not too familiar with. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy difference in the harmonic oscillator plus rigid rotor model, but the next state is the first energy level above, which includes both possibilities.

But regardless, the options don't match the rotational transition I calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon that causes a transition from the ground state to the first state (v=1, J=0), which is the vibrational transition. But that transition has higher energy, but the photon would have higher momentum.

Wait, let me compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition.

h ν = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, B 2.3e-27, C 1.1e-27, D 1.4e-28.

Hmm, 8.83e-28 is close to option D (1.4e-28), but not exactly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'll re-calculate p for the vibrational transition.

ν is 4e14 rad/s. So f = ν/(2π) ≈ 4e14 /6.28 ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

h ν = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = (h ν) / c = 2.65e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps the question is asking for the rotational transition, and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as v=0, J=0, and the next state is v=0, J=1, so the rotational transition. But my earlier calculation gave a momentum of 3e-31 Ns, which is way below the options. So maybe I messed up the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me re-calculate I.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

2e-10 squared is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.015e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Then, E_rot = h²/(8 π² I) * [J(J+1)].

Wait, E_J = (J (J+1)) * (h²/(8 π² I)).

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is (2)(h^2/(8 π² I)).

Wait, no. E_J=0 is zero. E_J=1 is (1*2) h²/(8 π² I) = 2 h²/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

So ΔE = h²/(4 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 * (3.1416)^2 * 1.206e-46).

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 squared is 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 4 * π² ≈ 39.478; 39.478 * 1.206e-46 = 47.62e-46 = 4.762e-45.

So ΔE_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.762e-45 ≈ (4.39/4.762) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.922 *1e-22 = 9.22e-23 J.

Then p_rot = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are that small. So perhaps the problem is referring to the vibrational transition, but the calculation gives 8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option either. Wait, looking back, option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of ν. The given w is 4e14 rad/s. So ν (frequency) is w/(2π) ≈ 4e14 / 6.28 ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

h ν = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, but what if the question is considering the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency? Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the bond length in a different unit. Let me double-check the bond length. It's given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in atomic mass units but without converting to kg. Wait, but in the formula for moment of inertia, I must use kg and meters.

Hmm, maybe I should double-check all the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p_vib. Let me compute it again.

h ν = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 J / (3e8 m/s) = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D (1.4e-28), but it's about 6 times smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express h ν in terms of other constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the momentum in terms of angular frequency directly.

p = h ν / (2 π c) ?

Wait, E = h ν, and p = E/(c) = h ν / c. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't match. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can't undergo a pure rotational transition because the selection rules require ΔJ = ±2, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the molecule in the ground state (v=0, J=0) can only transition to a state with higher vibrational energy, since the rotational transition would require a photon with even lower energy than that, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes, but that would complicate things.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which includes both rotation and vibration. So the next state could be the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon of energy h ν.

Then, the momentum p = h ν / c.

h ν = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = 2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s = 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy for the next state in the rotational-vibration model, which is a combination of both.

Wait, but perhaps the model is such that the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot.

So, the ground state is (v=0, J=0): E0 = (1/2) h ν + 0.

The next state could be (v=1, J=0): E1 = (3/2) h ν + 0.

Or it could be (v=0, J=1): E1 = (1/2) h ν + [h²/(4 π² I)].

Which of these is lower?

As I calculated earlier, the rotational energy difference is about 9.22e-23 J, and the vibrational is about 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon of momentum 3.07e-31 Ns. But the options don't have that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first possible state that can be accessed, which might be the first vibrational state, but that's a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the moment of inertia. Let me re-calculate I.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈3.016e-27 kg.

I = μ * r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is thinking of the next state as the first vibrational state, which would match option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute E_rot.

E_J = (J (J+1)) * h²/(8 π² I).

So for J=1, E1 = (1*2) h²/(8 π² I) = 2 h²/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

So ΔE = E1 - E0 = h²/(4 π² I).

Compute h²: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = 1.206e-46 kg m².

So denominator:4 π² I =4 * (9.8696) *1.206e-46 = approx 47.6e-46.

So ΔE =4.39e-67 /47.6e-46 =4.39e-67 /4.76e-45 = (4.39 /4.76) * 1e-22 = 0.922e-22 =9.22e-23 J.

p =9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the non-rigid rotor model, which allows for vibrational and rotational transitions to be coupled, leading to a different energy difference.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the potential energy function is not purely harmonic, so the energy levels may have different spacing. However, I'm not familiar enough with the exact approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would complicate things, and I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the energy differences again. The rotational transition requires less energy, but the photon's momentum is way too small. The vibrational transition's momentum is ~8.8e-28, which is much closer to option D (1.4e-28), but still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h ν.

Wait, w is 4e14 rad/s, which is the angular frequency. So ν is w/(2π) = 4e14/(6.283) ≈ 637e12 ≈6.37e13 Hz.

h ν = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, but that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the calculation of the rotational transition, but the options are using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy as E = (1/2) h ν, which would be the zero-point energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy. Let me check.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = [ J (J+1) ] * (h²)/(8 π² I).

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_J=1 - E_J=0 = (2 h²)/(8 π² I) ) = h²/(4 π² I).

Yes, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the moment of inertia as the sum of the atomic masses times r², but that's incorrect. Because the correct formula uses the reduced mass.

So I = μ r², which I have done.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The options don't match either calculation. But perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me compute ΔE_rot again.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

I = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Denominator 4 π² I =4*(9.8696)*1.206e-46 = 47.6e-46 = 4.76e-45.

So ΔE_rot =4.39e-67 /4.76e-45 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

p =9.22e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

But that's way too small. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, but with a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the bond length in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the vibrational transition energy.

Wait, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator are E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν.

So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h ν. So the photon's energy is h ν, and its momentum is h ν / c.

As computed earlier, that's 8.83e-28 kg m/s, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the given angular frequency is in terms of the vibrational energy, but the question is about rotation. Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used here is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, and the energy levels are quantized as E = E_vib + E_rot. So the next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The lower energy transition is J=1.

But as I calculated, the momentum is 3e-31, not matching any options. So perhaps the question is expecting the answer for the vibrational transition, even though the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is close to 1.4e-28. Let me see what h ν would be for that.

p = h ν / c → h ν = p * c.

So for option D: p =1.4e-28 Ns = 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

h ν =1.4e-28 *3e8 =4.2e-20 J.

ν =4.2e-20 J / h =4.2e-20 /6.626e-34 ≈6.34e13 s^-1.

But the given w is4e14 rad/s, which is about double that. Hmm. So this doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the angular frequency w as the frequency ν. So h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Then p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy in terms of ½ h ν. Because in the harmonic oscillator, the energy is (v + ½) h ν, so the transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE = h ν. If the question somehow uses (½) h ν, that would change things. But I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotational constants in terms of frequency, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is given in terms of the rotational constant B, where B = h/(8 π² c I), and the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1) h c.

Wait, maybe the energy difference is 2 B h c.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: B is the rotational constant defined as B = h/(8 π² c I), and the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1) (h c / B) )? No, wait, perhaps E_J is expressed in terms of cm^-1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of the rotational constant B.

But this is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Since the options are given, I can try to compute which ones match.

Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns.

Let's compute what energy that would correspond to.

p =1.4e-28 kg m/s.

E = p * c =1.4e-28 *3e8 =4.2e-20 J.

Which is equal to h ν → ν = E/h =4.2e-20 /6.626e-34 ≈6.34e13 Hz.

But the given w is 4e14 rad/s, which is approximately 6.37e13 Hz when divided by 2π. So 4e14 rad/s is about 6.37e13 Hz.

So, 4.2e-20 J corresponds to a frequency of approximately 6.34e13 Hz, which is about 4e14 rad/s. So that would imply that the photon's energy is h ν=4.2e-20 J, which would match option D.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me see: 4e14 rad/s is the given w. So ν = w/(2π) = 4e14/(6.283) ≈6.37e13 Hz.

h ν =6.626e-34 *6.37e13 ≈4.21e-19 J.

Wait, no, earlier calculation said h ν is 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting calculations. Let me recompute:

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

ν (frequency) = w/(2π) =4e14/(2 *3.1416) ≈ (4e14)/6.283 ≈6.37e13 Hz.

So h ν =6.626e-34 *6.37e13 ≈4.21e-19 J.

Then p =4.21e-19 /3e8 =1.403e-28 kg m/s → 1.403e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier calculations.

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Earlier, I multiplied h by w, but that's incorrect. Because ν is w/(2π), so h ν is h * (w/(2π)).

So the correct calculation is:

h ν =6.626e-34 J s * (4e14 rad/s)/(2 π).

Which is 6.626e-34 *4e14 /6.283 ≈ (2.65e-19 J) /6.283 ≈4.21e-20 J.

Wait, no:

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J*rad. Then divide by 2π, which is about 6.28. So 2.65e-19 /6.28 ≈4.21e-20 J.

Then E =4.21e-20 J.

p = E/c =4.21e-20 /3e8 = 1.403e-28 kg m/s → 1.403e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses of atoms**:  
  \( M_X = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_Y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_X \cdot M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
  \]  
  Converting to kilograms:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu r^2 = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
  \]

- **Angular frequency**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).

### Energy Differences:
1. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_J = \frac{J(J+1) h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}.
   \]  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = \frac{h^2}{4 \pi^2 I}.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2,
   \]  
   \[
   4 \pi^2 I = 4 \cdot (9.8696) \cdot (1.206 \times 10^{-46}) \approx 4.76 \times 10^{-45}.
   \]  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{4.76 \times 10^{-45}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This is much smaller than any of the given options, so the rotational transition is not the correct answer.

2. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \nu.
   \]  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( v=0 \) to \( v=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu.
   \]  
   The angular frequency \( \omega \) is related to the frequency \( \nu \) by:  
   \[
   \nu = \frac{\omega}{2 \pi}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   \nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2 \pi} \approx 6.37 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
   \]  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.37 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.21 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.403 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This matches **option D**.

### Conclusion:
The next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the vibrational transition, and the required photon momentum is \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \).

**Answer: D**
