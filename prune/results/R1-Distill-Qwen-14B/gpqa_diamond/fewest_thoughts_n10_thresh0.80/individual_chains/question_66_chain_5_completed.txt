Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I should think about what I remember from my studies. Let's see, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators that preserve certain symmetries of the Standard Model.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to figure out which ones are required.

Wait, Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Oh right! Because the Poincaré group is the combination of the Lorentz group and the translations. So if a theory respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. So if the question says which must be respected by all operators, then perhaps Poincaré is a must.

But wait, SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, meaning Lorentz symmetry is definitely required. But wait, Poincaré symmetry is about the whole spacetime symmetry, including translations. Wait, SMEFT is a field theory, so it's built with Poincaré symmetry, right? Because all local field theories respect Poincaré symmetry.

Wait, but wait, the SMEFT is considered as a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories do respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Poincaré-invariant, so the SMEFT must also respect it. So both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are required. So any operator in SMEFT must be a Poincaré scalar. So both 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincaré) are required.

Now, what about CP and CPT? I remember that the Standard Model is CP symmetric, but not necessarily CPT symmetric. Wait, no, actually, the Standard Model is CPT symmetric because all the particles have their antiparticles, and the interactions are such that the theory is invariant under CPT. But wait, SMEFT operators might break CP if the Wilson coefficients are such. Oh, wait no! Wait, SMEFT includes all possible operators that are allowed by the symmetries of the Standard Model, except for those that would violate the Standard Model symmetries. Wait, no. The SMEFT includes all possible operators that are compatible with the Standard Model symmetries. So, for example, operators that are even under CP can be included, but operators that violate CP are not automatically forbidden? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the Standard Model is not CP symmetric. Wait no, the Standard Model does have CP symmetry. Wait, no. The Standard Model doesn't have a fundamental CP symmetry because of the CKM matrix. Oh wait, the Standard Model is actually not CP symmetric. Because the CKM matrix has complex phases which lead to CP violation. So the SMEFT, being an effective theory, would include operators that might respect or violate CP, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The question is about what symmetries all operators must respect. So the SMEFT is built such that each term in the Lagrangian must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry because of the CKM phase, but wait, no, actually, the SM does respect CP in its interactions. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, no, the Standard Model is known to have CP violation in the complex phases of the CKM matrix. But the effective theory, SMEFT, includes all possible operators that are allowed by the SM gauge symmetry. Therefore, the operators can include those that are CP even and those that are CP odd. But wait, no, the operators are constructed to transform in a particular way under the SM gauge group, but perhaps not necessarily under other symmetries like CP.

Wait, but the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. So any operator in the SMEFT must respect the same gauge symmetries as the SM, but what about other symmetries like Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, CPT?

So Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are definitely required because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, CP symmetry. The question is, do all operators in SMEFT have to respect CP symmetry? I think that's not the case. Because the SMEFT includes terms that can explicitly break CP. For example, the Weinberg operator (QCD term) doesn't violate CP, but other operators could potentially violate it. Wait, but wait. The standard model without right-handed neutrinos has a certain amount of CP violation. So, in the SMEFT, do we include terms that could further violate CP?

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT must include all possible terms that are allowed by gauge symmetry. So in that case, the operators can include terms that are even under CP and terms that are odd. Therefore, the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. But wait, no, because the operators are part of the effective theory, which must be consistent with the underlying theory's symmetries.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which of these symmetries are musts.

I remember that in the SMEFT, all operators must be Poincaré scalars, which includes Lorentz symmetry. So 1 and 2 are correct.

What about CP and CPT?

As I said, the SM is CPT symmetric because the CPT theorem holds in Lorentz-invariant theories. So any effective theory respecting Lorentz symmetry must also respect CPT.

Wait, the CPT theorem states that in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT symmetry holds. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, then it automatically respects CPT symmetry. So that's important. So all operators must respect CPT.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So operators must respect CPT symmetry.

So that would mean symmetry 4 (CPT) must be respected.

What about CP symmetry? Since the CPT theorem ensures that CPT is a symmetry, but CP itself is not necessarily a symmetry. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. Because the underlying theory (SM) can have CP violation, and the effective theory can include operators that violate CP as long as they are allowed by the gauge symmetry.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, when you add operators, you have to make sure that they are invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. But for CP, I think that the operators can violate CP. So not all operators in SMEFT must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP) is not a must.

So which options are correct?

The options are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry → yes.

2. Poincare symmetry → yes, because Poincare is part of the foundation.

3. CP symmetry → no, not necessarily.

4. CPT symmetry → yes, because of the CPT theorem.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is "1,2,4".


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, meaning all operators must transform as Lorentz scalars. This symmetry is fundamental to the framework.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since SMEFT is built as a field theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry. Thus, all operators must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: While the Standard Model (SM) includes CP violation due to the CKM matrix, SMEFT does not require operators to respect CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP as long as they are consistent with the SM gauge symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem ensures that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, including SMEFT, respects CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it automatically respects CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required.

**Options**:
- A) 1,2: Incorrect, as it excludes CPT symmetry.
- B) 3,4: Incorrect, as it excludes Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry.
- C) 1,2,4: Correct, as it includes all required symmetries.
- D) 1,3,4: Incorrect, as it excludes Poincaré symmetry.

Answer: C
