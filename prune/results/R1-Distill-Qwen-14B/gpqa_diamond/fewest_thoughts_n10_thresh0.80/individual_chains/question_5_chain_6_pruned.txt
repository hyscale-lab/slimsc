Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 times some 2x2 matrix. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, these components are related to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P must be a spin operator, like the spin angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle, like a muon. 

The eigenvector we're looking for is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. I remember that for spin operators, the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along a particular direction. 

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the vector n has components (nx, 0, nz). So the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, and phi would be zero since it's in the x-z plane. But wait, the question says it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so n could have any angle θ, but phi is 0. 

The operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. So the operator we're interested in is P · n, since we're looking for the eigenvector along direction n. 

Wait, no, the operator is along n, so the operator is P_n = P · n_hat, where n_hat is the unit vector (nx, ny, nz). But since n is in x-z plane, ny=0, so n_hat = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But φ is zero because it's in x-z plane, so n_hat = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator is P_n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because P_y would have no contribution here since n has no y-component.

Wait, but to find the eigenvector, I might not need to construct the entire operator. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the eigenstates in terms of the spin-up along a certain direction.
