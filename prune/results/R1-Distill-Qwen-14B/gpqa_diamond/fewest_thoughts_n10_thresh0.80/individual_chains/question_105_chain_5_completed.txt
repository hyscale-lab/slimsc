Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun. It says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that as the star rotates, these spots come into view and change the observed brightness, which can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking what radius a hypothetical exoplanet would need to have to produce the same brightness variation as the spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted. So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that the brightness variation caused by a planet transiting a star is calculated using the area blocked. The formula I think is (Rp / Rstar)^2 because the area is proportional to the square of the radius. But wait, in this case, the star isn't a planet, but the spots are causing a similar effect.

Wait, but the star has spots that cover 20% of one hemisphere. Oh right, the filling factor is 20%, which probably means the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. But wait, the star's hemisphere is half its surface, so the total area covered would be 0.5 (for hemisphere) multiplied by 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1 or 10% of the star's total surface. Because a hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere.

So the spots cover 10% of the star's surface. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the observed brightness from that part is less. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip would depend on how much less the spots emit compared to the rest of the star.

So the flux from the star without spots is L = 4πRstar² σ Teff⁴. When a spot is present, the flux from the spot is L_spot = 4πRspot² σ (Teff - ΔT)⁴. Wait, but actually, the spots are covering a part of the star's surface, so the total flux when the spot is facing us would be (L_clear - L_spot + L_cooled_spots). Wait, maybe I should model it differently.

Wait, no. The star emits uniformly except for the spots. So the total flux when the spots are on the visible side would be the normal flux minus the contribution from the spots because the spots are cooler.

So the normal flux is L = 4πRstar² σ T_eff^4. The flux when a spot is visible: the area of the star's disk is A = π Rstar². The spots cover a fraction f of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is f * 0.5 * A = 0.2 * 0.5 * π Rstar² = 0.1 π Rstar².

Wait, wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πR²) ? No, wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². A hemisphere is half that, so 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Wait, no: perhaps the filling factor is with respect to the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²), which is 0.4πR².

Wait, but when the star rotates, each spot comes into view in the same way as a planet transit. So the observed flux variation depends on the temperature difference of the spots and the surrounding areas.

Wait, but when the spots are on the side facing us, the flux from those spots is lower. So the total flux when the spots are visible is less than the normal flux. So the change in flux would be the difference between the normal flux and the flux when the spots are facing us.

So the normal flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4. Because, for a blackbody, the flux is σ T^4 per unit area. So the total flux is (4π R²) * σ T^4 / (4π) ) = π R² σ T^4. Wait no, actually, the total flux is L = 4π R² σ T^4. But when a spot is present, a fraction of the surface emits at a lower temperature.

Wait, I think the key is to compute the difference in flux caused by the spots as they rotate into view. Let's model the flux when the spots are visible.

The total flux when the spots are on the visible side is F = F0 - F_spot, where F_spot is the flux lost due to the spots being cooler. Because the spots are cooler, they contribute less flux than the surrounding areas.

So F0 is the normal flux (when no spots are visible), F_spot is the difference between the flux without spots and the flux with spots.

Alternatively, the flux when spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - (T_spot^4)/(Teff^4) ) * (Area of spots / Area of star).

Wait, let me get this right. The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σ Teff⁴. When a spot is present on the visible hemisphere, the flux from that region is σ (Teff - ΔT)^4. So the change in flux is proportional to the area of spots.

Wait, maybe I should model the change in flux as a fraction of the total flux. The total flux when spots are visible is F = F_total - F_spot.

F_total without any spots is F0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

F_spot is the flux lost, which is the area of spots multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

Wait, the area of spots is A_spots = 0.2 * (2π Rstar²) ) = 0.4 π Rstar². Because each hemisphere is 2π R², and spots cover 20% of that.

The flux per unit area from the spots is σ (Teff - 1000)^4. So the difference from the normal area (Teff) is σ (Teff^4 - (Teff-1000)^4). So the total flux lost when spots are visible is A_spots * σ (Teff^4 - (Teff-1000)^4).

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the flux from the spots is lower, the total flux is F0 - (A_spots / A_total) * (F_spot - F_normal_per_area).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in flux.

The fractional change in flux due to the spots is [ (Area of spots) / (Area of star) ) * ( (Teff^4 - (Teff - 1000)^4 ) / Teff^4 ) ].

Wait, let me think. Each spot emits at T_spot = 5000 K. So for each spot, the flux per unit area is σ T_spot^4. The surrounding area emits σ Teff^4. So the difference per unit area is σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the total difference in flux when the spots are visible is A_spots * σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

The total flux without spots is F0 = A_total * σ Teff^4, where A_total is the surface area of the star, which is 4π Rstar².

Wait, but wait: A_total is 4π Rstar², and A_spots is 0.4 π Rstar², as calculated earlier.

So the change in flux (delta F) is A_spots * σ (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

The fractional change in flux is delta F / F0 = [ (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 )) ] / [4 π R² σ (6000^4) ) ].

Simplify this:

The R², σ, and π cancel out.

So (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 *6000^4 )

= (0.4 ( (6^4 -5^4) )) / (4 *6^4 )

Wait, to make it easier, let's compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio.

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

Similarly, 5000^4 is 625e12.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1296e12 -625e12 = 671e12.

So the numerator is 0.4 * 671e12 = 268.4e12.

The denominator is 4 * 1296e12 = 5184e12.

So the fractional change is 268.4e12 / 5184e12 = 268.4 / 5184 ≈ 0.0517, or about 5.17% dip.

Wait, but wait, the star's spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots may come into view. But since the star is observed over time, the maximum dip would be when the maximum area of spots is visible. But in this case, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, half of the spots would be visible at any time, right? No, wait: the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So as it rotates, the spots come into view fully when the star's face with spots is facing us. Oh wait, but the star's rotation period isn't given, but since it's a hemisphere, when it rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (without spots) comes into view. So the maximum dip would be when all the spots are visible, which is when the hemisphere with spots is fully facing us. So the fractional dip is as calculated: about 5.17% for the maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation is that only one hemisphere is spotted, so when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would be on the limb and perhaps we don't see them as much. But wait, no. The maximum dip would occur when the entire spotted hemisphere is in our line of sight. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the dip in brightness would be similar to that caused by a planet transiting the star. So the amplitude of the dip is what matters.

So the dip amplitude is 5.17% of the star's brightness.

Now, for the exoplanet. The dip caused by a planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2 because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar². So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the dip caused by the planet would be when it blocks part of the star's light, so the fractional change is (Rp / Rstar )^2, assuming Rp << Rstar, so that the planet doesn't block any more than a small fraction.

But in this problem, the dip caused by the spots is about 5.17% (approx 0.0517). So the planet's dip would need to be the same, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517.

Wait, but wait. No, perhaps not. Because the dip from the spots is not due to blocking light, but due to the spots emitting less. So the dip is about 5% of the star's light. The planet blocks a fraction of the light equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2. So to get the same dip amplitude, the planet's (Rp/Rstar)^2 should be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is ~5% or 0.0517.

Wait, but let me double-check. The dip from the planet is a decrease in flux by (Rp/Rstar)^2. The dip from the spots is a decrease in flux by 0.0517. So to get the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517. So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, that's a problem. Because 0.227 isn't among the options. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Let me go back and check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the area of the spots. Let me re-examine that.

The problem states that the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots visible is 0.4 π R².

The star's total surface area is 4π R², so the fraction of the surface covered by spots when the hemisphere is facing us is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R² ) ) = 0.1 or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the star's total surface is 4π R². So the spots are 0.4 π R², which is 0.1 of the total area. So when the star is oriented such that the spotted hemisphere is fully visible (i.e., the other hemisphere is on the back and not visible), the area of spots visible is 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the total star's surface.

So the fractional change in flux is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) * ( (Teff^4 - (Teff - 1000)^4 ) / Teff^4 ) * σ.

Wait, no. The fractional change is (Area of spots) * ( (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 ) / (Total area * Teff^4 ) ).

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the ratio as:

(Fractional dip) = (Area of spots visible / Area of star) * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

Wait, because each spot emits (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) times the normal flux. So the difference per unit area is (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / Teff^4 = 1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4.

So the fractional dip is:

(Fractional dip) = (A_spots_visible / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler, each spot's contribution is less. So the total flux when the spots are visible is F = F0 * (1 - (A_spots_visible / A_star) * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Wait, no. The total flux is F0 minus the difference caused by the spots.

Alternatively, the flux from the spots is less than the flux from the surrounding areas. So F = F0 - (A_spots_visible / A_star) * F0 * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

F = F0 * [1 - (A_spots_visible / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ]

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = A_star * sigma * Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux from those spots is A_spots_visible * sigma * T_spot^4.

So the total flux is F = (A_star - A_spots_visible) * sigma Teff^4 + A_spots_visible * sigma T_spot^4.

Which can be written as F = A_star sigma Teff^4 * [ 1 - (A_spots_visible/A_star) (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ].

So the fractional change is [ F - F0 ] / F0 = - (A_spots_visible/A_star) (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )).

Which is the fractional dip in flux.

So in our case, A_spots_visible is 0.4 pi R². A_star is 4 pi R². So (A_spots_visible / A_star) = (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) ) = 0.1.

Wait, wait wait! Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the area of the spots visible is 0.4 pi R², but the area of the hemisphere is 2 pi R². But the star's total surface is 4 pi R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by the spots is 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is spots.

Wait, no. Because the entire hemisphere is spotted. So when the star isn't rotating, the hemisphere is entirely covered by spots. When the star rotates, the other hemisphere (without spots) comes into view. So the maximum dip occurs when the entire 20% of the hemisphere is visible. Wait, no, because the star's surface is a sphere. So when you look at a hemisphere, the area you're seeing is 2 pi R². The spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.4 pi R². So when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 pi R² of the star's surface. But the star's total surface area is 4 pi R², so 0.4 pi R² / 4 pi R² = 0.1, which is 10% of the total surface.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The star's total surface is 4 pi R², and the area of the hemisphere (i.e., the area we see when looking at a hemisphere) is 2 pi R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots on that hemisphere are 20% of 2 pi R², which is 0.4 pi R². So in our line of sight, the spots cover 0.4 pi R², which is 10% of the total surface area (since 0.4 pi R² is 10% of 4 pi R²).

So (A_spots_visible / A_star ) = 0.1.

Teff is 6000 K, T_spot is 5000 K.

So (T_spot / Teff ) = 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) = (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 ) ≈ 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So the fractional dip is 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775, which is about 5.18% dip.

Now, for the exoplanet, the dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2. So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 equal to 0.051775.

Taking the square root, Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275, which is approximately 0.228.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option D) 0.32, which is higher than 0.228. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the area is computed. Let me think again. When the star is rotating, the hemisphere with spots is facing us. The area of spots visible is 20% of that hemisphere's area.

Wait, the hemisphere's area is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.4 π R². So when the star's hemisphere is facing us, the spots take up 0.4 π R² of the visible area. But the star's total surface area is 4 π R². So the spots cover 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the entire surface.

Wait, but perhaps the situation is that the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots would only be partially visible. But in this problem, the maximum dip would still be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, so the calculation above holds.

So the dip is 5.18%, so the planet's radius would need to be such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, which is about 0.32, which is higher than 0.227. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact value without approximating.

Let me compute (5000/6000)^4.

5000/6000 = 5/6.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747.

So the fractional dip is 0.0517747, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517747) = approximately 0.2275.

Hmm. None of the options match exactly. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2 = 0.1521 → 15.2%

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% → too small.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21% → too small.

D) ~0.32 → ~0.1024 → 10.24% → which is higher than our 5.18%.

Wait, but our dip is 5.18%, so the planet's dip would have to be 5.18% as well. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ~0.227.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's light curve is being modulated by the rotation, and the amplitude is the maximum dip minus the minimum, but I think I've done that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to account for the fact that the spots are only on one hemisphere. Wait, the star is rotating, so the spots come into view. But when the star is rotating, the spots are on the limb, so perhaps the area blocked is less than the full area of the spots. Hmm, but that's more complicated, and I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the overall change in brightness due to the spots, which could include both the day and night sides. Wait, but the problem says that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler. So when the spots are on the near side, the light is dimmer, but when they're on the far side, the light is the same as the rest of the star.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the spots as causing a dip when they are on the front hemisphere and a rise when they are on the back, but that seems unlikely because the spots are cooler and would not emit more when on the back side.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions as it rotates. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, which is the same as the Sun. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so 5000 K. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should consider that when the spot is visible, the flux is reduced, but when it's not visible, the flux is normal.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation is modeled as the star having a varying area of spots as it rotates, leading to a periodic brightness variation, which could be mistaken for a planet.

But regardless, the amplitude of the dip should be the same as that of the planet.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots. Let me recheck.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area = 2π R².

20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Star's total surface area is 4π R², so 0.4 π R² is 10% of the star's surface.

So when the entire hemisphere is visible, the spots cover 10% of the star's surface.

So (A_spots_visible / A_star ) = 0.1.

So the fractional dip is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.1 * (1 - 625/1296 ) = 0.1 * ( (1296 -625)/1296 ) = 0.1 * (671/1296) ) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

So dip is 5.1775%.

So for the planet, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

But none of the options match. The options are 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the star is emitting with a certain effective temperature, and the spots are cooler. So when the spots are on the far side, we don't see them, but when they're on the near side, we see their lower flux.

Wait, perhaps the overall brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, divided by the average.

Wait, when the spots are all on the far side, the flux is F0.

When the spots are all on the near side, the flux is F0 - delta_F.

So the amplitude is (F0 - (F0 - delta_F )) / F0 ) = delta_F / F0.

Which is the same as the fractional dip, 5.17%.

So the planet's dip must be the same. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 ⇒ Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are causing a change in the star's brightness as it rotates, leading to a variation in the light curve that's similar to a planet transit but in a different way.

Wait, the problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So perhaps the amplitude of the variation is similar to that caused by an exoplanet. So the dip caused by the spots is similar to the dip caused by a planet.

So to achieve the same amplitude, the planet's radius must be such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 equals the dip from the spots.

But according to my calculation, that's ~0.227, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is for the entire star, not just one hemisphere. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah! So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. Which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the hemisphere is facing us, the spots cover 0.4 π R², which is 10% of the star's total surface area. So that part is correct.

Hmm. So the dip is 5.1775%.

But this leads to Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.227, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the dip in terms of the brightness variation, not the fractional dip. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Wait, (5/6)^4 is (5^4)/(6^4) = 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.1 (the area fraction) → 0.051775.

Yes.

So the problem is that the answer isn't among the options. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's effective temperature is dominated by the spots. No, the Teff is given as 6000 K, which is the star's overall effective temperature. The spots are cooler.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the change in brightness is (R_spot/Rstar)^2.

Wait, but the radius of the spots is a function of their coverage. But perhaps the problem is treating the spots as if they were a planet causing the same dip. But I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude is the same as the planet's transit depth, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So to have the same amplitude, the planet's (Rp/Rstar)^2 must be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is 0.051775.

So Rp/Rstar is sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the dip as (A_spots_visible / A_star) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, but that's the same as I did before.

Wait, perhaps the star's radius isn't the same as the Sun's? No, the question states the star's radius is equal to the Sun's.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the dip in terms of the planet's radius relative to the star's radius, but perhaps I should consider that the spots are on one side, so when the star rotates, the spots move in and out of view, but perhaps the maximum dip isn't 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to rotate into view, and so the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, but the overall variation is a sinusoidal-like curve. But the amplitude is the maximum dip from the mean.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total flux change.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's flux is F = 4π R² σ Teff^4, and the spots cause a dip of F_spot = 4π (R_spot)² σ (T_spot)^4. But the spots are distributed over the hemisphere. So perhaps the area is the same as the planet's area.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the dip caused by the spots as a percentage and see what radius the planet needs to have.

Dip from spots: 5.1775% → 0.051775.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.051775 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but the spots are cooler and larger. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are not on the surface but in the photosphere, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere. Let me check that possibility.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R².

So the fractional area is 0.8 π R² /4 π R² = 0.2.

So the dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355 → 10.355% dip.

Then, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3218 → approximately 0.32, which matches option D.

Wait, so perhaps I misread the question. The filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

Ah, so the filling factor is 20% relative to the hemisphere. So the area is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.4 pi R² as I did earlier.

But if I had considered the filling factor as 20% of the entire star's surface area, then the area is 0.2 * 4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R², leading to a dip of 10.35%, which would correspond to option D.

But the problem says the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, not the entire star.

Hmm. So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to appear and disappear over time, leading to a variation in brightness that's similar to a planet's transit. But in that case, the dip's amplitude is as calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the brightness variation being the same as a planet's transit, and perhaps the planet's radius is such that its area is the same as the spots.

But the area of the spots is 0.4 pi Rstar². The area of the planet would be pi (Rp)^2. So setting pi Rp^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar² → Rp^2 = 0.4 Rstar² → Rp = sqrt(0.4) Rstar ≈ 0.632 Rstar. But that's way larger than any of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the luminosity contribution of the spots. Each spot has an area A and emits at a lower temperature.

So the total luminosity of the spots is A * sigma T_spot^4.

The normal luminosity per unit area is sigma T_eff^4.

So the difference per spot is sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

The total difference is A * sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

The fractional dip is this difference divided by the total luminosity, which is 4 pi Rstar^2 sigma T_eff^4.

So fractional dip = [A sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [4 pi Rstar^2 sigma T_eff^4 ]

The sigma cancels.

A is 0.4 pi Rstar².

So:

= [ 0.4 pi Rstar² (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 pi Rstar² 6000^4 ]

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 *6000^4 ]

Calculate numerator and denominator.

6000^4 = 1.296e+13 (approx 1296e12)
5000^4 = 6.25e+12 (625e12)
6000^4 -5000^4 = 671e12.

So:

0.4 * 671e12 = 268.4e12.

Denominator:4 * 1.296e13 = 5.184e13.

So fractional dip = 268.4e12 /5.184e13 = 268.4 / 5184 ≈ 0.05177 → 5.177%.

So that's correct.

So to have the same dip, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is not the same as the Sun's, but that's stated as equal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are causing a dip that's the same as the planet's transit, but perhaps the star is bigger or smaller. No, the star's radius is given as same as the Sun's.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Compute sqrt(0.05177) precisely.

0.05177 → square root.

Let me compute 0.227^2 = 0.051529.

0.2275^2 = (0.227 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.227² + 2*0.227*0.0005 + 0.0005² = 0.051529 + 0.000227 + 0.00000025 ≈ 0.051756.

Which is very close to 0.05177.

So sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

So Rp/Rstar = ~0.228.

Looking at the options: option D is 0.32, which is about 0.32, leading to a dip of ~0.1024 (10.24%). That's larger than our 5.17% dip.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the star's surface is being considered. For example, perhaps the spots are on the hemisphere, but the star's surface we see is only the hemisphere, so the total dip is 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 20% of 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². So the dip is 0.4 pi R² * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) / (4 pi R² ) → (0.4 pi R² ) / (4 pi R² ) ) * 0.51775 = 0.1 * 0.51775 = 0.051775.

So that's correct.

But perhaps the problem is that the star is observed from a certain inclination, and the spots are on the equator, so their apparent size is smaller because they're on the limb. But that's probably beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the star's rotation. Let me think: perhaps when the star rotates, the spots move across the disk, which would modulate the brightness over time, but the maximum dip is when the entire spot is in front. So that shouldn't change the maximum dip calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to appear in a way that the observed dip is lower because the spots are on the limb, so their area is smaller in projection. But I think that's more about the shape of the light curve than the maximum dip.

Hmm. I'm stuck because according to my calculation, the Rp/Rstar is approximately 0.228, but that's not an option. Maybe I should check the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39 → (0.39)^2 = 0.1521 → 15.21% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21% dip.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, making them 5000 K. So the blackbody flux from spots is (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482.

So the spots emit 48.2% of the star's flux per unit area.

So each spot reduces the flux by 51.8% per unit area.

If the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.4 pi R², then the total flux reduction is 0.4 pi R² * (1 - 0.482) = 0.4 pi R² * 0.518.

The star's total flux is 4 pi R² * 1 (since Teff is 6000 K).

So the fractional dip is (0.4 pi R² * 0.518 ) / (4 pi R² ) ) = (0.4 * 0.518 ) / 4 = (0.2072) /4 = 0.0518 → 5.18% dip.

So again, the same result.

So the planet's radius must be such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp = 0.227 Rstar.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius isn't the same as the Sun's. But the question says it is.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the star's rotation period causes the spots to only partially block the light. But I think that's not the case for the maximum dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, but the planet would need to block the same area as the spots when viewed from Earth. But that's what I've already considered.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip in terms of the planet's radius being the same as the spot's radius. But that doesn't make sense because the spots are spread over a larger area.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is not just due to the spots, but also due to the star's rotation causing Doppler shifts or other effects, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The correct calculation gives Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.228, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the star's effective temperature is not 6000K, but the spots are 1000K cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the surrounding areas are at 6000K, and the spots are at 5000K.

Thus, the dip in flux is the area of the spot times the difference in flux per unit area.

So the fractional dip is (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's apparent brightness when the spots are on the far side, leading to a higher brightness. But that's not relevant to the dip.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into view, so the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - (A_spots/A_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) ) )

When the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0.

So the amplitude is (F0 - F) = F0 - F0 * (1 - f * (1 - (T_spot^4/T_eff^4 )) ) ) = F0 * f * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Which is the same as the dip.

So the amplitude is the same as the dip.

So the planet's radius must produce the same amplitude, which would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.228.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star is only spotty on one hemisphere, so the maximum dip is when the spots are on the limb, thus appearing smaller. So the actual area of the spots visible is less than 0.4 pi Rstar².

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to appear in a certain way, but I think that wouldn't change the maximum dip.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the star's brightness is being modulated due to the spots, but the observed variation is the same as that of a planet. So the amplitude is the same, but perhaps the problem is considering the total area of the spots and the planet being the same.

But that would mean that the planet's area is equal to the spots' area.

The area of the spots is 0.4 pi Rstar². The area of the planet is pi (Rp)^2.

Setting them equal: pi Rp² = 0.4 pi Rstar² → Rp² = 0.4 Rstar² → Rp = sqrt(0.4) Rstar ≈ 0.632 Rstar.

But that's larger than any of the options, and probably not an option anyway.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the planet's area as a fraction of the star's area. But that's the same as (Rp/Rstar)^2, which brings us back to the previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's flux with and without spots. When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F0 - delta_F. When they're on the far side, the flux is F0. So the amplitude is delta_F, and the planet must cause the same delta_F.

So delta_F = F0 * (Rp/Rstar)^2 → delta_F = F0 * (0.05177).

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.227.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star has an effective temperature of 6000K, but the spots are 1000K cooler than the star's effective temperature. So the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are at 5000K. But when calculating the flux variation, perhaps I should compare the flux from the spots to the star's total flux, which would change the calculation.

Wait, no, because the star's effective temperature already accounts for the entire surface. The spots just reduce the flux from a part of the surface.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the flux from the star as the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions.

When the spots are facing us, the flux is:

F = (Area_unspotted * sigma Teff^4 ) + (Area_spotted * sigma T_spot^4 )

= sigma [ (A_unspotted) Teff^4 + (A_spotted) T_spot^4 ]

The area unspotted is A_unspotted = A_total - A_spotted = 4 pi Rstar² - 0.4 pi Rstar² = 3.6 pi Rstar².

So F = sigma [ 3.6 pi Rstar^2 * 6000^4 + 0.4 pi Rstar^2 * 5000^4 ]

= sigma pi Rstar^2 [ 3.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 * 5000^4 ]

The normal flux (F0) is sigma pi Rstar^2 * 4 * 6000^4.

So the fractional dip is (F0 - F) / F0.

= [ F0 - F ] / F0 = [ sigma pi R² (4*6000^4) - sigma pi R² (3.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4) ] / (sigma pi R² 4*6000^4 )

Simplify numerator:

= sigma pi R² [4*6000^4 -3.6*6000^4 -0.4*5000^4 ]

= sigma pi R² [0.4*6000^4 -0.4*5000^4 ]

= sigma pi R² * 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So:

= [ 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) * sigma pi R² ] / [4 *6000^4 * sigma pi R² ]

Cancel terms:

= 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 )

= (0.4/4 ) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4

= 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

= 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) → same as before.

Which gives 0.1 * 0.51775 → 0.051775.

Same result.

So the same conclusion holds. So the correct Rp/Rstar is approximately 0.228, which isn't one of the options.

But the options are A) 0.39, B) 0.07, C) 0.11, D) 0.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area of the spots. Let me consider the possibility that the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface, not the hemisphere.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then the area of spots is 0.2 *4 pi Rstar² = 0.8 pi Rstar².

So (A_spots / A_star) = 0.8 pi Rstar² /4 pi Rstar² = 0.2.

Then, fractional dip is 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3218 → ~0.32, which is option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, and the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

But the question says the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is D) 0.32.

But according to the problem statement, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation period causes the spots to cover 20% of the entire visible area as it rotates, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on the equator, so when viewed from Earth, the apparent area is 20% of the star's disk, leading to a dip of 0.2^2=0.04, 4% dip. But that's not the case here.

Hmm. I'm going to have to make a choice here. The only way to get an option that matches is if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, leading to option D) 0.32.

So despite the problem stating that the filling factor is for one hemisphere, perhaps the intended answer is D.


The problem involves a star with a radius equal to the Sun's, where one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler (5000 K). The goal is to determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots, assuming the star was not covered by spots.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Spot Coverage and Fractional Dip**:
   - The filling factor of 20% applies to one hemisphere. The surface area of a hemisphere is \( 2\pi R^2 \), so the area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2 \).
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R^2 \), so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is \( \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1 \) (10%).

2. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The flux from the star without spots is proportional to \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), and the flux from the spots is proportional to \( T_{\text{spot}}^4 \).
   - The fractional dip in flux is given by:
     \[
     \text{Fractional Dip} = \left(\frac{\text{Area of Spots}}{\text{Total Area}}\right) \times \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right)
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \text{Fractional Dip} = 0.1 \times \left(1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\right)
     \]
     \[
     \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225
     \]
     \[
     \text{Fractional Dip} = 0.1 \times (1 - 0.48225) = 0.1 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.051775 \, (5.18\% \, \text{dip}).
     \]

3. **Exoplanet Radius for the Same Dip**:
   - The dip caused by a planet is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 \). Setting this equal to the dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.051775
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.051775} \approx 0.2275
     \]
   - This value does not match any of the provided options.

4. **Revisiting the Filling Factor**:
   - If the filling factor of 20% applies to the entire star instead of just one hemisphere, the area of the spots would be \( 0.2 \times 4\pi R^2 = 0.8\pi R^2 \), making the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots \( \frac{0.8\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.2 \) (20%).
   - Recalculating the fractional dip:
     \[
     \text{Fractional Dip} = 0.2 \times \left(1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\right) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355 \, (10.35\% \, \text{dip}).
     \]
   - For the exoplanet:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.10355, \quad \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218 \, (0.32).
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The calculated value of \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any option. However, if the filling factor applies to the entire star, the closest match is \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.32 \), corresponding to **Option D**.

ANSWER: D
