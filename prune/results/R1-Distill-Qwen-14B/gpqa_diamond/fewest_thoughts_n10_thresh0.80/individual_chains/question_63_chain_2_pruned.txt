Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, the molecule consists of elements X and Y. The masses are given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? And the next state with the lowest energyâ€”so I think that refers to the next higher energy state. But wait, what exactly are we considering here? Are we talking about a vibrational or rotational transition?

The model is the rotation-vibration model, which probably means it's the non-rigid rotor model where the bond length isn't fixed, so both rotation and vibration are considered. But the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So I think the process involves a photon being absorbed, leading the molecule to move to the next higher energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the state of lowest energy. The next state would probably be the first excited state. But since the molecule is a diatomic, the energy levels can be split into rotational and vibrational parts, I think.

Wait, the problem is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, no. The next state's lowest possible energy would imply moving to a higher energy state, which is the first possible higher state, right?

So, in terms of the energy levels, the molecule is in its ground state (fundamental state), and we're looking for the photon that will cause it to transition to the next higher energy state.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in the quantum models, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. For a rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and for vibration, the harmonic oscillator model applies.

Wait, but the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, non-rigid rotor implies that the bond
