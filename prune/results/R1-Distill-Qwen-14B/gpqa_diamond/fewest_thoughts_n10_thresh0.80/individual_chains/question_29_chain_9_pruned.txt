Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

The scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. This is bad because it makes the barley unsuitable for food. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then look for changes in the gene sequence to find a mutation that eliminates the compound.

The question gives us the sequences of the intact gene and four mutants (1-4). We need to figure out which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means the mutation disrupts the gene's function, maybe by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Let's look at the sequences closely.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGA... and ends with TGA. The TGA is a stop codon, I think. Wait, wait, TGA is a stop codon in the genetic code.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the wild type, the first part is a bit different. Let me see: the wild type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So the mutant's sequence where it differs is in the first part.

Let me break it down. The wild type first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT.

Wait, so the wild type's first part after ATG is TTTC. So positions 4-6 are TTT. In mutant 1, that's TCT. So that's a change from TTT to TCT. Then, the next part: CGCT in wild type becomes CGTA in mutant.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any changes that affect the reading frame or produce a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift mutation would cause this, but looking at the sequences, all the mutants seem to have the same length. Hmm, because if EMS causes a point mutation, it would be a substitution, not a frameshift. So the number of nucleotides is the same; no insertions or deletions. So all mutations are substitutions.

So looking for a substitution that creates a stop codon early in the sequence, before the end of the gene.

Looking at each mutant's sequence:

Wild type: The start is ATG, which is methionine, and then continues.

Mutant 1: Let's see, the first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

The wild type after ATG is TTTCTC GCTGGTACT.

Mutant 1: after ATG is TTCTACG
