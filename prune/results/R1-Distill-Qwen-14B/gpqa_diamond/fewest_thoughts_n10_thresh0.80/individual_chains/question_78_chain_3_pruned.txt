Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when charges are moving, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. But the question is about potentials, so I need to recall what scalar and vector potentials are.

The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, right? Like E is the negative gradient of V. And the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B, which is the curl of A. But wait, when charges are moving, the vector potential becomes important because the magnetic field arises from moving charges.

The setup here is a charge q moving along some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at a point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh, so d is like the displacement between the field's origin and the point r. 

The velocity of the charge at the generating time tr is v. And we're looking at time t, which is larger than tr, so the events are in the correct time order—meaning the charge's effect at time tr propagates to the observation point at time t.

I think I need to use the retarded potentials. Because when you have moving charges, the potentials are not just instantaneous but depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, called the retarded time. Oh wait, the problem says d is the vector from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So the distance is d, but I'm not sure how d relates to r. Wait, the field generating point is where the charge was at time tr, so the vector from there to r is d. So the distance between the charge at tr and the observation point is |d|.

Now, the scalar potential V... I remember the formula for the scalar potential from a moving charge. The scalar potential due to a charge q moving with velocity v is given by the static potential (like the Coulomb potential) multiplied by a factor accounting for the motion. The same goes for the vector potential.

The static Coulomb potential is V0 = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance. But when the charge is moving, r would be replaced by the distance d, but considering the charge's velocity. Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Lorentz transformation or retarded time.

Alternatively, I think the potentials can be written as:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1 + (v²/c²)) / (d c - v·d)

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the general expressions for retarded potentials involve terms with velocity. Let me think.

The scalar potential V due to a charge in motion is given by V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1) / (|\vec{d}| (1 - (\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d})/c )) ) ] where \hat{d} is the unit vector in the direction of d. Alternatively, I think the denominator is d multiplied by (1 - (v·d)/(c |d|
