Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm trying to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let's see. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both compounds. So both are aromatic with four substituents because benzene has six carbons, and 10-6=4. So each compound has four substituents on the benzene ring.

The NMR spectrum shows two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm, each a singlet and in a 1:1 ratio. So that's two different singlet aromatic protons, each integrating to one proton each since the ratio is 1:1. Wait, but wait, in 1H NMR, the integration is based on the ratio of the number of protons. So if each singlet is integrating to 1, that would mean each has two protons, but wait no, because if the ratio is 1:1 between the two signals, each must integrate to the same number.

Wait, the question says it's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds. So the total area under each peak should reflect their presence. But the NMR shows two signals in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, maybe each compound contributes a singlet, but they're in 1:1 ratio in the mixture. So for each aromatic environment, each compound has a certain number of protons.

Wait no, let me think again. The NMR shows two signals (two singlets) each integrating to 1:1 ratio. So each of the two signals comes from each compound, and each has the same number of protons. Because the mixture is 1:1, so the integration is based on each compound's proportion. So each signal represents the number of protons in each compound.

Wait, maybe each compound contributes one singlet, each with the same number of protons. So each singlet integrates to one proton each. But that doesn't seem right because typically, each aromatic proton in a singlet would have more than one equivalent. Oh wait, but maybe each compound has only two equivalent aromatic protons each, so each singlet integrates to 2, but since the mixture is 1:1, the ratio of the signals would be 1:1. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the question says two signals, each a singlet, in a 1:1 ratio. So the area for each is same. So maybe each has the same number of protons. So each singlet is integrating to the same number. Let's say each has two protons. So each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons, giving two singlets in the NMR, each integrating to 1:1.

But wait, the question says two signals at around 6.7 ppm. So this would be the region for aromatic protons, probably deshielded, maybe in a meta or para position, or maybe in a more substituted position.

Then, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So that's three different types of protons, each singlet. The 2:1:1 ratio suggests that one type has two protons, the other two types have one each.
