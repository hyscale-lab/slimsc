Alright, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Okay, the question is asking me to arrange the given nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. The options are numbered 1 through 5. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO- maybe?)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS- maybe? Or CH2CH2S-?)

Wait, no, Ethanethiolate would be CH3CH2S⁻. Right, the conjugate base of ethanethiol.

So, nucleophilicity can depend on several factors: the solvent used, the basicity of the nucleophile, and the structure of the nucleophile. The question specifies aqueous solution, so it's in water. In such a polar protic solvent, the solvation of the nucleophile plays a big role. Highly solvated nucleophiles are less reactive because they're surrounded by solvent molecules which shield them.

Strong bases are generally better nucleophiles, but in a protic solvent like water, very strong bases (like OH-) can be less nucleophilic because they get heavily solvated. However, in a polar aprotic solvent, solvation is less of a factor, and the stronger bases are more nucleophilic. So, I need to think about the strengths of these nucleophiles in aqueous solution.

First, I should figure out the basicity of each. The more basic a species is, the better nucleophile it tends to be, but in a protic solvent, that's not always straightforward.

Let me list the nucleophiles again:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's a cyclohexoxide ion, right? So alkoxide ions are strong bases. But steric effects might play a role here. 4-methylcyclohexoxide should be a bulky base. Wait, but in terms of nucleophilicity, bulky groups might hinder attack because the nucleophile has a hard time approaching the electrophilic center.

2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): A strong base. But in aqueous solution, it's the conjugate base of water, so it's quite solvated. Because of that, its nucleophilicity might not be the highest.

3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻, or CH₂CH2COO⁻). Propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid. Its acidity is weaker than carboxylic acids, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, propionate is a carboxylate ion, so it's a weaker base than hydroxide? Wait, no. Carboxylate ions are weaker bases than hydroxide. Or wait, I think hydroxide is a stronger base than carboxylate. Because the conjugate acid of hydroxide is water (pKa ~15.7), while the conjugate acid of propionate is propionic acid (pKa ~4.88). So since the propionate comes from a stronger acid, it's a weaker base than OH⁻.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): That's a neutral molecule. It's a poor nucleophile because it's not deprotonated. Nucleophilicity is better for the conjugate base. So in this case, the methoxide would be a better nucleophile, but methanol is a weaker nucleophile.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻ or CH2CH2S⁻): The conjugate base of ethanethiol. Thiols are weaker acids than alcohols, right? Wait, no. Thiols are stronger acids than alcohols. For example, ethanethiol has a pKa around 10, while ethanol has a pKa around 19. So since ethanethiol is a stronger acid than ethanol, its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is a weaker base than hydroxide. Wait, wait: No, because if the acid is stronger (lower pKa), the conjugate base is weaker. So OH⁻ is a stronger base than S⁻. So ethanethiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide. But in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, the S⁻ might be less solvated than O⁻? Or wait, oxygen is more electronegative, so maybe the O⁻ is more stabilized but less nucleophilic. Or wait, sulfur is less electronegative, so the S⁻ might be a better nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent. Hmm. But in aqueous solution, solvation is key.

Wait, in aqueous solution, the nucleophilicity order might not directly follow basicity because of solvation. For example, I recall that in water, the order of nucleophilicity for some common anions is F⁻ < OH⁻ < I⁻ < RS⁻ (thiolates). Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the order is such that better nucleophiles are less solvated. So, for example, iodide is a better nucleophile than bromide in aqueous solution because it's less tightly held by solvation (since it's larger and the solvation is less effective? Or is it the opposite? I'm a bit confused here.)

Wait, another approach: in polar protic solvents (like water), the order of nucleophilicity is opposite to basicity. So stronger bases are less nucleophilic because they're more solvated. So more basic → more solvated → less nucleophilic.

Wait, no, that's in polar aprotic solvents. In polar aprotic, stronger bases are better nucleophiles. In polar protic, it's the opposite because strong bases get more solvated, making them less reactive. So in water, the less basic nucleophiles are better because they are less solvated.

Wait, but this might not always hold. For example, thiols have a lower electronegativity than oxygen, so their conjugate bases (thiolates) are larger and maybe less solvated. So in aqueous solution, perhaps thiolates are better nucleophiles than hydroxide ions?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each nucleophile's strength.

First, the strongest bases are likely to be the worst nucleophiles in aqueous solution because they are highly solvated.

So, OH⁻ is a strong base. But in aqueous solution, it's surrounded by water molecules, so its nucleophilicity is lower. But among the given nucleophiles, which is the strongest base?

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's an alkoxide. Alkoxides are strong bases. But since it's a cyclohexyl group with a methyl, is it less basic than, say, OH⁻? Or is it more bulky. Wait, cyclohexoxide is a strong base, but maybe it's less basic than, say, t-butoxide because of steric hindrance? Wait, wait, no, t-butoxide is less basic than smaller alkoxides because of steric hindrance. Wait, actually, the base strength inversely relates to steric hindrance. Bulky groups make the conjugate acid more stable, so the base is weaker. So 4-methylcyclohexoxide is less basic than, say, methoxide? Hmm, maybe. Let me think about pKa values. The pKa of cyclohexanol is about 19.7, while methanol is around 19.9. Wait, no, wait, pKa of water is ~15.7, methanol is ~19.9, cyclohexanol around 19.7. So, the conjugate bases (methoxide and cyclohexoxide) would have similar strengths, but perhaps cyclohexoxide is slightly weaker than methoxide. Or perhaps the opposite? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps in terms of basicity, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a strong base, second only to hydroxide? Or maybe hydroxide is the strongest base among them.

Wait, let's list each:

1. 4-Methylcyclohexanolate: strong base, but maybe not as strong as OH⁻.

2. Hydroxide: Strong base, very high basicity.

3. Propionate: CH₂CH₂COO⁻. Its conjugate acid is propionic acid, pKa around 4.88. So propionate is a weaker base than OH⁻ because the conjugate acid is stronger.

4. Methanol: Neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile. Its conjugate base, methoxide, is a strong base, but the question lists methanol, not its conjugate base.

5. Ethanethiolate: CH₂CH₂S⁻. The conjugate acid is ethanethiol, which has a pKa around 10. So the thiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide, which has a conjugate acid (water) pKa ~15.7. So OH⁻ is a stronger base than S⁻.

So, in terms of basicity, from strongest to weakest:

2 (OH⁻) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 5 (ethanethiolate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol? No, methanol is neutral. Wait, but methanol is a neutral molecule, so its nucleophilicity is lower than the anions.

Wait, no, methanol is a weak nucleophile because it's not deprotonated. So among the given species, the order of basicity is:

OH⁻ (2) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > ethanethiolate (5) > propionate (3). Methanol (4) is a neutral molecule, so it's less basic than any of the anions.

Since in aqueous solution, stronger bases are more solvated and thus poorer nucleophiles. So the weakest nucleophiles are the strong bases because they're heavily solvated. So the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be opposite to basicity? Wait, no, I think the trend is that weaker bases are better nucleophiles in polar protic solvents because they're less solvated.

So, let's think: if a nucleophile is a weaker base, it's less solvated, so more available to attack. So the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be from weakest base to strongest base?

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's the opposite. For example, in aqueous solution, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide because hydroxide is a stronger base and more solvated. So the weaker base (iodide) is a better nucleophile.

So, in our case, the weakest base would be propionate (3), then methanol (4), but wait, methanol is neutral. Wait, no, the weakest base among the anions would be propionate. Then, the order of nucleophilicity would be from weakest base to strongest base (but considering that weaker bases are better nucleophiles in aqueous).

Wait, perhaps the correct order is from least basic to most basic. So, weaker bases (but better nucleophiles in aqueous). But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Let me list all the nucleophiles again and their approximate basicity:

1. 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate: Strong base, similar to other alkoxides. Let's say pKa of the conjugate acid (cyclohexanol) is ~19.7. So the conjugate base is strong but not as strong as OH⁻.

2. OH⁻: very strong base, conjugate acid pKa ~15.7.

3. Propionate: conjugate acid pKa ~4.88. Weaker base than the others.

5. Ethanethiolate: conjugate acid pKa ~10. So weaker base than OH⁻, stronger than propionate.

4. Methanol: Neutral, so not a strong base. Its conjugate base is methoxide, with pKa ~19.9, so same ballpark as 1 and 2.

Wait, but in this question, the nucleophiles are the species themselves. So, for each:

1. O⁻ (cyclohexanolate)
2. OH⁻
3. CH₂CH₂COO⁻
4. CH3OH
5. S⁻ (ethanethiolate)

So, the basicity order is: 2 (OH⁻) > 1 (O⁻) >5 (S⁻) >3 (COO⁻) >4 (CH3OH).

In aqueous solution, the more basic the nucleophile, the more it’s solvated and thus less reactive as a nucleophile. So the order of nucleophilicity should be opposite to basicity. So the weakest base would be the best nucleophile, the strongest base the worst.

So, from least basic to most basic (weakest to strongest base):

3. Propionate (COO⁻) < 5. Ethanethiolate (S⁻) <4. Methanol (neutral) <1. Cyclohexanolate (O⁻) <2. Hydroxide (OH⁻).

Wait, but in our list, OH⁻ is the strongest base, followed by cyclohexanolate, then ethanethiolate, then propionate, and methanol is neutral.

Wait, no, because 4. Methanol is a neutral molecule and a weaker nucleophile than any of the anions because it's not deprotonated. So in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, the order would be: the weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

So, from best to worst nucleophilicity:

Weakest base → best nucleophile

So:

Propionate (3) is weaker than ethanethiolate (5), which is weaker than cyclohexanolate (1), weaker than OH⁻ (2). Wait, no, wait, propionate is weaker than ethanethiolate because its conjugate acid is stronger. So the order of basicity is 2 >1 >5 >3.

Wait, so the order of basicity is:

2 (OH⁻) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) >5 (ethanethiolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol neutral).

So the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be opposite: 3 <5 <1 <2, but wait, the weakest base is best nucleophile, so 3 (propionate) is the least basic, so it's the best nucleophile? But wait, propionate is a carboxylate, which is a weaker base than the others, so in aqueous solution, it's better nucleophile than the stronger bases.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

Ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than cyclohexanolate (1), which is weaker than hydroxide. So in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity would be 5 >1 >2 >3 >4?

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Another approach: let's think about their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

Methanol (4) is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile compared to the anions. So it's going to be near the bottom of the list.

Propionate (3) is a carboxylate. Carboxylate ions are weaker bases than hydroxide and thiolate. So in aqueous solution, they're less solvated? Or more solvated? Wait, weaker bases (like I⁻) are less solvated and thus better nucleophiles in polar protic solvents.

So, propionate is a weaker base than ethanethiolate, which is weaker than cyclohexanolate, which is weaker than hydroxide.

So, in aqueous, nucleophilicity order would be: weakest base first.

Which would be propionate (3) < ethanethiolate (5) < cyclohexanolate (1) < hydroxide (2). But wait, that can't be right because propionate is weaker than ethanethiolate.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Basicity: 2 (OH⁻) >1 (O⁻) >5 (S⁻) >3 (COO⁻).

So in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity would be the reverse: 3 (COO⁻, propionate) is the best, then 5 (S⁻, ethanethiolate), then 1 (O⁻, cyclohexanolate), then 2 (OH⁻). But wait, wait, that's not correct because in aqueous solution, even though propionate is a weaker base than ethanethiolate, maybe ethanethiolate is a better nucleophile.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let's think about this. In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common anions is often:

I⁻ > RO⁻ (alkoxide) > S⁻ (thiolate) > COO⁻ (carboxylate) > OH⁻.

Wait, no, I think in aqueous solution, the order is: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > OH⁻. Hmm, but that's for halides. For other nucleophiles, perhaps the trend is different.

Wait, another approach: in DMSO (polar aprotic), the order of nucleophilicity follows basicity. But in water, it's opposite. So in water, the weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

So among the given anions:

- OH⁻ is the strongest base → worst nucleophile in water.

- Ethanethiolate (S⁻) is weaker base than OH⁻ → better nucleophile than OH⁻ but worse than propionate?

Wait, no. Wait, propionate is COO⁻, which is even weaker base than S⁻. So in water, propionate should be a better nucleophile than S⁻, which is better than O⁻, etc.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think about specific data points.

For example, I know that in aqueous solution, the thiolate ion (S⁻) is a better nucleophile than the hydroxide ion (OH⁻). Because S⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so it's less solvated and more available to attack.

Wait, but wait, what about comparing S⁻ with COO⁻?

Carboxylate ions (COO⁻) are weaker bases than S⁻. So in aqueous solution, COO⁻ would be better nucleophiles than S⁻? No, wait, no. Because the weaker the base, the less it's solvated, so better nucleophile.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be:

Weakest base → strongest nucleophile.

Weakest base in the list is propionate (COO⁻). Then comes ethanethiolate (S⁻), then cyclohexanolate (O⁻), then OH⁻.

But wait, no, because cyclohexanolate is O⁻, which is a stronger base than S⁻. So the order of basicity is OH⁻ (2) > cyclohexanolate (1) > ethanethiolate (5) > propionate (3).

So in aqueous, nucleophilicity order is: 3 (propionate) >5 (ethanethiolate) >1 (cyclohexanolate) >2 (OH⁻). But wait, that can't be right because I've heard that thiolates are good nucleophiles in aqueous solution.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the order is:

5 (ethanethiolate) is a weaker base than 1 (cyclohexanolate), so in aqueous, 5 is a better nucleophile than 1.

So the order would be 5 >1 >2 >3?

No, that can't be right because 3 is the weakest base.

Wait, perhaps the correct nucleophilicity order in aqueous is as follows:

The weakest base is propionate (3), so it's the best nucleophile. Then comes ethanethiolate (5), then cyclohexanolate (1), then hydroxide (2), and methanol (4) is the worst.

Wait, but methanol is neutral. So the order would be 3 >5 >1 >2 >4.

But looking at the options, let's see:

The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at option D: 5, 2, 1, 3,4 → order 5 (best), 2, 1,3,4 (worst).

Option A: 5,2,3,1,4.

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4.

Option B: 2,5,1,4,3.

Wait, but according to my previous reasoning, the order should be: 3 (best),5,1,2,4 (worst). So the order is 3 >5 >1 >2>4.

But looking at the options, none of them have 3 as the first. Because the options are:

Option A) 5, 2, 3, 1,4.

Option D)5,2,1,3,4.

Option B)2,5,1,4,3.

So none of the options match 3,5,1,2,4.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should consider that in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is:

Ethanethiolate (5) is a better nucleophile than hydroxide (2) because it's a weaker base and thus less solvated.

So, maybe the order is:

5 >1 >2 >3 >4.

Wait, why would 1 (cyclohexanolate) be next after 5? Because cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than 5, but weaker than 2.

Wait, perhaps 5 is a better nucleophile than 1.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach: think about the solvent. In aqueous solution, which nucleophiles are more reactive?

Methanol is a neutral molecule, so it would be the poorest nucleophile. Among the anions, the order of nucleophilicity is: the weaker the base, the better the nucleophile.

So the order:

Weakest base (best nucleophile) → strongest base (worst nucleophile)

Which would be:

3 (propionate) <5 (ethanethiolate) <1 (cyclohexanolate) <2 (OH⁻).

Wait, no. Wait, propionate is the weakest base, so best nucleophile. Then ethanethiolate, then cyclohexanolate, then hydroxide.

But again, looking at the options, I don't see any that start with 3.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating the basicity of the species.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that, while OH⁻ is a strong base, it's a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution compared to thiolate and other weaker bases.

So the order of nucleophilicity is:

Ethanethiolate (5) > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > hydroxide (2) > propionate (3) > methanol (4).

Wait, but that would suggest 5 is the best, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

No, because in this order, after 5 comes 1, then 2, then 3, then 4.

Looking at option D: 5,2,1,3,4. So it's 5 first, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Hmm, but according to my reasoning, 5 >1 >2 >3>4. So the order would be 5,1,2,3,4.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the nucleophilicity order. Maybe in aqueous solution, cyclohexanolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide?

Alternatively, perhaps in aqueous solution, the order is OH⁻ < 1 <5 <3.

No, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think about the typical nucleophilicity order in aqueous solution for different nucleophiles.

In aqueous solution, the order often is:

HS⁻ (thiolate) > HO⁻ (hydroxide) > RO⁻ (alkoxide) > COO⁻ (carboxylate) > others.

Wait, perhaps thiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in aqueous solution because it's a weaker base and less solvated.

So, in that case, 5 (Ethanethiolate) would be a better nucleophile than 2 (OH⁻), which is better than 1 (cyclohexanolate), which is better than 3 (propionate).

And methanol (4) is neutral, so the worst.

So the order would be:

5 (best) >2 >1 >3 >4 (worst).

So the order is 5,2,1,3,4.

Looking at the options, which option has this order?

Option D is: 5,2,1,3,4. So the option D would be the correct order.

Wait, but earlier I thought that among the anions, the weakest base is propionate, so it would be the best nucleophile, but perhaps that's not the case when comparing to others.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe in aqueous, the order is: thiolate > hydroxide > alkoxide > carboxylate.

Wait, that would make the order 5 >2 >1 >3, with 4 being the worst.

So the order is 5,2,1,3,4.

So option D) 5,2,1,3,4.

Yes, that seems correct.


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given species in aqueous solution, we consider the following factors:

1. **Basicity**: Stronger bases are more solvated in polar protic solvents like water, which reduces their nucleophilicity. Thus, weaker bases are generally better nucleophiles in aqueous solutions.
2. **Nucleophilicity Trends in Aqueous Solutions**: In aqueous solutions, nucleophilicity often follows the trend where weaker bases (less solvated) are better nucleophiles. For example, thiolates (S⁻) are better nucleophiles than hydroxide ions (OH⁻) because they are weaker bases and less solvated.
3. **Comparison of the Given Nucleophiles**:
   - **1. 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (O⁻)**: A strong base due to its alkoxide nature, but less basic than hydroxide (OH⁻). It is expected to be a moderate nucleophile.
   - **2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A very strong base, but in aqueous solution, it is heavily solvated, reducing its nucleophilicity.
   - **3. Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A carboxylate ion, which is a weaker base than both hydroxide and thiolate. In aqueous solution, it is less solvated and thus a better nucleophile than stronger bases.
   - **4. Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it a poor nucleophile compared to the anions.
   - **5. Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: A thiolate ion, which is a weaker base than hydroxide. Due to its lower basicity, it is less solvated and more nucleophilic in aqueous solution.

4. **Final Order of Nucleophilicity**: Based on the above analysis, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is:
   **Ethanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > Propionate (3) > Methanol (4)**.

This matches the sequence provided in **Option D**.
