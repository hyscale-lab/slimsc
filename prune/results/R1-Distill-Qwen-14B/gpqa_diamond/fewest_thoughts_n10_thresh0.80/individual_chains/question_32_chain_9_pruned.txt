Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we need to use the theory of relativity, specifically the equations related to kinetic energy or total energy. Since the problem is asking about the energy of the collider, I think it's referring to the kinetic energy each nucleus is accelerated to. But wait, sometimes in these problems, they might ask for total energy instead of just kinetic. I should be careful.

So the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me figure out what that is. Lithium usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Or wait, Li normally has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, I need to find the energy when its speed is 0.96c. So the speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light. I recall that in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

Wait, but wait. The problem says the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions to a certain energy, which is their kinetic energy. So maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy here, not the total energy. Or does the question mean total energy? Hmm, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, the RHIC's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy per particle, right? Or sometimes it's the total energy. I think in this context, it refers to the kinetic energy since that's what's typically discussed when talking about particle accelerators. Or perhaps it's the total energy. Let me think again.

The question is: What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So maybe we're looking for the kinetic energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total energy (gamma * m c squared) minus the rest energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Well, perhaps I'll compute both and see.

Wait, no, in accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic energy. So I should compute the kinetic energy when the speed is 0.96c.

But wait, another approach: the total energy is gamma times the rest energy. The rest energy is m c squared. So the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times m c squared.

So first, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me remember that the atomic mass of a nucleus can be approximated as the sum of protons and neutrons, each approximately 1 atomic mass unit (u). So Li
