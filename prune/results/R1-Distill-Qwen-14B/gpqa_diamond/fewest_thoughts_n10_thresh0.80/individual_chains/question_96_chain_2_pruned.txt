Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supermassive black hole and calculating its entropy. Hmm, I've studied some basic black hole thermodynamics before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d=1e10 parsecs. We need to find the entropy of the black hole, and the options are on the order of 1e59 to 1e66 J/K.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh right, A is the surface area of a sphere with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius.

First, let me get the radius of the event horizon. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is (2 G M) / c^2. But maybe I can find R_s from the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh, because θ is given as the angular size, which for small angles can be approximated as θ ≈ R_s / d. So R_s ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but theta is in degrees. I should convert that to radians because the formula probably uses radians. Oh right, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17 * π) / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians approximately.

Wait, but let me calculate that more accurately. θ_radians = θ_degrees * (π/180). So θ_degrees is 1e-17, so θ_radians is (1e-17) * (π / 180) ≈ (3.1416 / 180) * 1e-17 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So approximately 1.745e-19 rad.

So R_s ≈ θ * d. But wait, d is given as 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert parsecs into meters because all the constants are in SI units.

Wait, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d is 1e10 parsecs, so d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R_s ≈ θ_rad * d = (1.745e-19 rad) * (3.086e26 m) ≈ Let me compute that. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 *3.086) e ( -19 +26 )= approx 5.37e7 meters. Wait, 1.745 * 3.086 is about 5.37, so 5.3
