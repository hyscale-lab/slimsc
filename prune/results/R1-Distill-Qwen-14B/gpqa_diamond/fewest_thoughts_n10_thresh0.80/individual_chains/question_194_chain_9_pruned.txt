Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my statistical mechanics, but I'll try to remember.

The system has three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A to D, each with different exponential terms.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state, right? The Boltzmann factor is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So Z = sum_{all states} e^(-βE).

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I think I need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and compute E for each, then sum up the e^(-βE) terms.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a smarter way without enumerating all 8 states. Let's see.

The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair. Let me think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Because if S_i and S_j are the same, their product is +1; if different, -1.

So each of the three terms contributes either +1 or -1. So the sum can range from -3 (if all three are -1) to +3 (if all three are +1). But wait, let me think: how?

Wait, no, actually, each term is +1 or -1, so the sum can be 3 (if all three are +1), 1 (if two +1 and one -1), -1 (if two -1 and one +1), or -3 (all three -1).

Wait, let me compute all possible combinations:

Case 1: All three spins are +1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1.
