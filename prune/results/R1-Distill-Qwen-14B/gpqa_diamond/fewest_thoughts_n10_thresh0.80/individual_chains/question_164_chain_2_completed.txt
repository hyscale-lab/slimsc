Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, binary star systems, right. So, both systems have eclipses, and their periods are given. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, which I think relates to their orbital periods. 

Wait, the problem says that system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Oh wait no, wait: the periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. So system_1 has a longer period than system_2.

Then there's the spectroscopic observations. For system_1, the radial velocity (RV) variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has amplitudes of 15 and 10. So each star's velocity amplitude is given. I remember that the RV method uses the Doppler shift to determine the masses. 

I think the key here is to find the mass of each system. The mass of a binary system can be found using Kepler's third law. The formula I remember is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the stars. But wait, another approach is using the velocity amplitudes. 

Oh right, the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass. The formula I think is K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ). But wait, this might get complicated because we don't know the inclination angle. However, since both systems are eclipsing, their inclination is likely close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So maybe we can ignore that factor for both systems, as they're both eclipsing.

But wait, in this problem, the two stars in each system have different velocities. Let me think. For a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so its velocity amplitude would be lower. 

So in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Since the more massive star moves less, the 10 km/s star is the less massive one, and the 5 km/s is the more massive? Wait, no. Wait, that's not right. Because the less massive star would have to move more to balance the system. Think about it: if one star is more massive, it's closer to the center of mass. So the less massive star has a larger orbit, hence higher velocity. So in system_1, the star with 10 km/s has lower mass than the one with 5 km/s? Wait no, that can't be. Because if the more massive star is moving slower, the less massive star must move faster to balance the same orbital period. So if star A has a velocity K1 and star B has K2, and their masses are M1 and M2, then M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because from the center of mass condition, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, and since velocity is proportional to a (for same period), K1/K2 = M2/M1. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, let me get that right. The more massive star has a smaller orbit (a1) and thus a smaller velocity (since velocity v = 2πa/P). So K is proportional to a, which is inversely proportional to the mass. So the mass ratio M1/M2 = a2/a1 = (v2)/(v1) = (K2)/(K1).

So in system_1, the two stars have velocities K1 =10 and K2=5. So the mass ratio M1/M2 is 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2. Which means the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2. Wait, that's the other way. Wait, no, no, wait: M1 is the mass of the star with K1=10, M2 is the one with K2=5. So M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10=0.5. So M1 is half of M2. So total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but system_2 has velocities of 15 and 10. So K1=15, K2=10. So M1 (for system_2, K1=15) is the mass of the star with K=15, and M2 is the one with K=10. So M1/M2 = K2/K1 =10/15=2/3. So M1= (2/3) M2. So the total mass for system_2 is M1 + M2 = (2/3) M2 + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, wait no. Let me double-check. For system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So M1 (star with K=10) is less massive than M2 (star with K=5), because M1/M2 = K2/K1 =5/10=0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2, and M2 is the other star. So total mass is (0.5 +1) times M2? Wait that can't be right because we're comparing system_1 to system_2.

Wait, perhaps I should model each system's total mass using their velocity amplitudes and the orbital period.

Another approach: Kepler's third law for binary systems can be written as (M1 + M2) = (4π²/G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P². But since a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a_total.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula that relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses. The relation is M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because from center of mass: M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, and K is proportional to a (since a = (v * P)/(2π)), so K is proportional to a. So M1 K1 = M2 K2.

So for system_1: M1 *10 = M2 *5 => M1 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

For system_2: M1 *15 = M2 *10 => M1 = (10/15) M2 = (2/3) M2. So the total mass is (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but wait, the M1 and M2 here are the individual masses for each system. So for system_1, the total mass is 1.5 M2, but for system_2, the total mass is 5/3 M2, where M2 in system_2 is the mass of the second star. Wait, perhaps I should clarify the notation. Let me denote system_1 as having M1a and M1b as the masses, and system_2 as M2a and M2b.

So for system_1:

M1a * K1a = M1b * K1b

K1a =10, K1b=5.

So M1a *10 = M1b *5 → M1a = (5/10) M1b = 0.5 M1b.

Total mass for system_1: M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Similarly for system_2:

M2a *15 = M2b *10 → M2a = (10/15) M2b = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass for system_2: M2a + M2b = (2/3) M2b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Now, the question is, what is the ratio of system_1's mass to system_2's mass.

But wait, the periods are different. Because the period affects the masses via Kepler's law. So perhaps the total mass is proportional to (a1 + a2)^3 / P². Since a = (v * P)/(2π), because a = velocity * period / (2π). Because the orbital circumference is 2πa, so velocity v = 2πa / P → a = v P/(2π).

So a1 and a2 can be expressed in terms of their velocities and the period. So for system_1, a1 = (10 km/s) * 2 years / (2π), and a2 = (5 km/s) * 2 years / (2π). Similarly for system_2, a2a = (15 km/s)*1 year/(2π), a2b = (10 km/s)*1 year/(2π).

But wait, the sum a1 + a2 is the separation between the two stars. So for system_1, a_total = a1 + a2 = (10 * 2) / (2π) + (5 *2)/(2π) = [20 +10]/(2π) =30/(2π) =15/π.

Similarly for system_2, a_total = (15 *1)/(2π) + (10 *1)/(2π) =25/(2π).

So now, using Kepler's third law: (M1 + M2) * P² = (4π²/G) * (a_total)^3.

But since we want the ratio, perhaps we can compute the ratio of M1 to M2.

Because (M1) * P1² = (4π²/G) (a1_total)^3

(M2) * P2² = same for system_2.

So the ratio M1 / M2 = (a1_total³ / P1² ) / (a2_total³ / P2² )

Wait, let me write it as (M1) / (M2) = ( (a1_total^3) / (P1^2) ) / ( (a2_total^3) / (P2^2) ) )

But wait, because (M1) is (4π²/G) (a1_total^3) / P1², and similarly for M2.

So M1/M2 = [ (a1_total³ / P1²) ] / [ (a2_total³ / P2²) ]

We have a1_total and a2_total from earlier.

So let me compute a1_total and a2_total:

For system_1:

a1_total = (10 * 2 + 5 * 2) / (2π) → because a1 = (v1 * P)/2π and a2 = (v2 * P)/2π, so a1 + a2 = (v1 + v2) * P/(2π).

v1 + v2 for system_1 =10+5=15, P=2 → 15 *2/(2π) =15/π.

Similarly, system_2: v1 + v2=15+10=25, P=1 → 25 *1/(2π) =25/(2π).

So a1_total for system_1 is 15/π, and a2_total for system_2 is 25/(2π).

So plugging into M1/M2:

M1/M2 = [ ( (15/π)^3 ) / (2²) ) ] / [ ( (25/(2π))^3 ) / (1²) ) ]

Let me compute each part:

(15/π)^3 = (3375)/(π³)

Denominator for system_1: 2²=4 → So numerator is 3375/(π³) /4 = 3375/(4 π³)

Denominator for system_2: (25/(2 π))^3 = (15625)/(8 π³)

So M1/M2 = [3375/(4 π³)] / [15625/(8 π³) * (1) ) ] → let me compute that.

Wait, the denominator for system_2 is (25/(2π))^3 = 25^3/( (2π)^3 )= 15625/(8 π^3). And P2=1, so denominator is [15625/(8 π^3)] / 1 = 15625/(8 π^3).

So M1/M2 = [3375/(4 π^3)] / [15625/(8 π^3)].

Simplify the fractions:

= (3375/(4 π³)) * (8 π³ / 15625 )

π³ cancels out.

= (3375 *8 ) / (4 *15625 )

Compute numerator and denominator:

3375 *8 = 27000.

4 *15625=62500.

So 27000/62500 = 27/62.5 → 27 divided by 62.5.

Wait, 62.5 is 100/1.6 → 27/(100/1.6) )= 27 *1.6 /100 = 43.2/100 = 0.432.

So M1/M2 ≈ 0.432. 

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, D is ~0.7. Hmm, 0.432 is closer to 0.4 than 0.5, but maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 3375 *8 = 27000, correct. 4 *15625 =62500. 27000/62500 = (27 * 1000)/(625*100) ) = (27 * 1000)/(625 *100) )= (27 * 10)/(625) )= 270 /625. 270 ÷625 = 0.432, yes.

So M1 is approximately 0.432 times M2. Wait, but wait no: M1 is the mass of system_1, M2 is the mass of system_2.

Wait, the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So it's M1 / M2. So if M1 is 0.432 times M2, then system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive.

But the options are in how much more massive system_1 is. So if M1 is 0.432 M2, that's about 0.4 times. So the ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4, which is option A. But wait the options say 'by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2'. So if M1 is 0.432 M2, then system_1 is less massive than system_2. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, which would mean system_2 is more massive.

Wait, but the question is 'By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?' So if M1 is less than M2, the factor would be less than one. So option A is ~0.4, which would imply system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2, i.e., less massive. But the options have A as ~0.4, which is the ratio M1/M2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the a_total calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass function is involved. The mass function for a spectroscopic binary gives the mass ratio. But since both stars' velocities are measured, perhaps the mass function is the same as the actual mass.

Wait, another thought: the sum of the velocities (K1 + K2) for each system. For system_1, 10 +5=15. For system_2, 15+10=25. But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe the velocity amplitudes and periods can be used to find the mass ratio without considering the actual separation.

Wait, another approach: the mass function in binary stars is given by f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1) ) ) = (K1^3 P)/(2π G). Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, considering that for a circular orbit, the mass function is f(M) = (v1^3 P)/(2π G), but when both stars' velocities are known, perhaps each gives a mass function.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that M1 + M2 = (4π² a³)/(G P²). But a is the sum of the semi-major axes of the two stars, which is (a1 + a2) = (v1 P/(2π)) + (v2 P/(2π)) ) = P (v1 + v2)/(2π).

So a = (v1 + v2) P/(2π).

Thus, a³ = (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π³).

So putting into M1 + M2:

M = (4π² * a³ )/( G P² )

= (4π²) * ( (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π³) ) ) / ( G P² )

Simplify numerator:

4 π² * (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 → denominator is 8 π³ G P².

So M = [4 π² (v1 +v2)^3 P^3 ] / [8 π³ G P² ]

Simplify terms:

4/8 = ½, π²/ π^3 = 1/π, P^3 / P² = P.

So M = [ (½) (v1 +v2)^3 P ] / ( G π )

So M = ( (v1 +v2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, but G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. But the velocities are in km/s, so I need to convert units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio M1/M2, using the formula derived earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for M1 and M2:

M1 = ( (K1^3 P) )/( 2 π G (1 + q)^(2) ), where q is M2/M1.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Earlier, I found that M1 is 0.432 times M2. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. But the question is by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So the factor is 0.43, which is approximately 0.4. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, let me re-express the ratio.

Wait, M1 is 0.432 M2. So system_1's mass is 43% that of system_2. So it's less massive. So system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.43. So the correct answer would be option A (~0.4).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the M1/M2 calculation.

M1/M2 = [ (a1_total^3 / P1^2) ] / [ (a2_total^3 / P2^2) ]

a1_total = 15/π, a2_total =25/(2π).

So a1_total^3 = (15/π)^3 = 3375/(π^3)

a2_total^3 = (25/(2π))^3 = 15625/(8 π^3)

P1=2, P2=1.

So M1/M2 = [ (3375/(π^3)) / 4 ] / [ (15625/(8 π^3)) /1 ]

Which is [3375/(4 π^3)] / [15625/(8 π^3)].

Simplify the denominators:

= (3375/(4 π^3)) * (8 π^3/15625)

π^3 cancels.

= (3375 *8) / (4 *15625 )

3375 *8 = 27000.

4*15625 =62500.

27000 /62500 = 27/62.5 = 0.432.

Yes, correct. So M1/M2=0.432. So the factor is approximately 0.4.

The options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So the correct answer is A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and masses in binary star systems.

### Key Information:
1. **System 1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_{1b} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Total mass: \( M_1 = M_{1a} + M_{1b} \)

2. **System 2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{2a} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2b} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Total mass: \( M_2 = M_{2a} + M_{2b} \)

### Step 1: Mass Ratio Between Stars in Each System
For a binary system, the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of the velocity amplitudes:
\[
\frac{M_{1a}}{M_{1b}} = \frac{K_{1b}}{K_{1a}}, \quad \frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}} = \frac{K_{2b}}{K_{2a}}
\]
- For system_1:
  \[
  \frac{M_{1a}}{M_{1b}} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \implies M_{1a} = 0.5 M_{1b}
  \]
  Total mass of system_1:
  \[
  M_1 = M_{1a} + M_{1b} = 0.5 M_{1b} + M_{1b} = 1.5 M_{1b}
  \]

- For system_2:
  \[
  \frac{M_{2a}}{M_{2b}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \implies M_{2a} = \frac{2}{3} M_{2b}
  \]
  Total mass of system_2:
  \[
  M_2 = M_{2a} + M_{2b} = \frac{2}{3} M_{2b} + M_{2b} = \frac{5}{3} M_{2b}
  \]

### Step 2: Total Mass Ratio Between the Systems
Using Kepler's third law, the total mass of a binary system is proportional to:
\[
M \propto \frac{a^3}{P^2}
\]
where \( a \) is the total separation between the stars, and \( P \) is the orbital period. The total separation \( a \) is proportional to the sum of the velocity amplitudes multiplied by the period:
\[
a \propto (K_1 + K_2) \cdot P
\]
Thus, the total mass ratio \( \frac{M_1}{M_2} \) is:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{\left[(K_{1a} + K_{1b})^3 / P_1^2\right]}{\left[(K_{2a} + K_{2b})^3 / P_2^2\right]}
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( K_{1a} + K_{1b} = 10 + 5 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
- \( K_{2a} + K_{2b} = 15 + 10 = 25 \, \text{km/s}, \, P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \)

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{\left(15^3 / 2^2\right)}{\left(25^3 / 1^2\right)} = \frac{\left(3375 / 4\right)}{\left(15625 / 1\right)} = \frac{3375}{4 \cdot 15625} = \frac{3375}{62500} = 0.054
\]

### Step 3: Final Ratio of System Masses
The total mass of system_1 compared to system_2 is:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} \approx 0.432
\]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.43 times** as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.4**.

**Answer: A**
