Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The chemist found a white solid, and he has some spectral data to identify it. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one fits the spectral data.

Let me look at the data provided.

Mass spectrometry: Molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%), and another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, molecular ion is the molecular weight, so the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. The other peak at 158 suggests something like a chlorine isotope because Cl has a significant natural abundance of about 32% for the M+2 peak. Chlorine has an approximate abundance of 75% for the ^35Cl (mass 35) and about 25% for ^37Cl (mass 37). So M is 156, M+2 is 158 at 32%, which is roughly 25% of 130? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, wait, the molecular weight is 156. If the molecule has a Cl, then the M would have 35Cl, and the M+2 would be 37Cl. So the abundance of M+2 would be approximately the abundance of ^37Cl, which is about 25% of the normal Cl. But the peak here is 32%, which is a bit higher than 25%. Hmm, but maybe the molecular formula has more than one Cl? Or perhaps it's a different isotope effect.

Wait, the molecular weight is 156. Let me see the options. Let's check each option's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Its formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 5*1=5, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16*2=32. Adding up: 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So the molecular weight is around 156.5, which rounds to 157. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless perhaps the molecular formula is different.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A? Wait, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C6H5ClCOOH? No, wait, benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. So 4-chlorobenzoic acid would be Cl attached to the benzene ring in the para position relative to COOH. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as option A. Molecular weight same as above, around 156
