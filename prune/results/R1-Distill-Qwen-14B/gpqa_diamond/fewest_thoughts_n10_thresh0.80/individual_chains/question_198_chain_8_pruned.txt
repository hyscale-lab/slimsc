Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and determining the percentage of a specific blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species in solution.

Hmm, right, stability constants, β, are involved here. I remember that the stability constant (formation constant) indicates how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that's four different β values. I think each β corresponds to a different complex, probably with different numbers of SCN- ligands attached.

I think the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^n+, [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ etc., up to [Co(SCN)_4]^n+ since there are four β values. Each β represents the formation of the complex with one more SCN ligand than the previous. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Oh wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So we're looking for the concentration of the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n+) complex.

So the goal is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are [Co(SCN)_2]^(n+). To find this, I think I need to calculate the distribution of each cobalt species based on their stability constants and then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato form.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands. The formula involves the formation of each complex step by step, considering the addition of each ligand.

Let me think about the general approach. The fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constants up to that point, multiplied by the ratio of ligand concentrations. But wait, since each subsequent complex adds another ligand, the fraction for the
