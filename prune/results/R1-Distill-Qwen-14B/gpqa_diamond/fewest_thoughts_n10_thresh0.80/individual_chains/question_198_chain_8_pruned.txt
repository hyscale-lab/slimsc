Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands attached, right? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+. But which one is the blue one? I remember that [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, but I'm not 100% sure. Anyway, I'll proceed with the assumption that the question is about the Co(SCN)_2 species.

Stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So the order of stability is β3 (63) for the trithiocyanato complex, then β4 (16), wait no, β2 is 40, which is higher than β1 (9). Wait, no, β3 is 63, which is the highest. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ligands? Because β3 is the largest. So the species would form in the order where higher beta complexes are favored.

Wait, but we're looking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato (two SCN-) complex. So, the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or whatever charge it has. Hmm.

I think the general approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions involved. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the Co species (free Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc.) but the stability constants will determine the distribution.

But how do we model this? I think we can use the formation constants to find the fraction of each complex.

The formation constants are for each step of complexation.
