Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several steps to produce a final product. I need to figure out what each step does and then determine which option is correct.

First, let's list out what each step does. Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitric acid and sulfuric acid are used as nitrating agents. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution with nitrating agents, typically introducing a nitro group. The nitration of benzene usually happens under certain conditions. Where does the nitro group attach? Since benzene is symmetric, the nitro group can go in any position, but in the case of a first substitution, it's usually meta directing if there are any existing substituents. Wait, but benzene is just benzene, so the nitration would introduce a nitro group in a specific position based on the directing effects. Wait, nitro groups are meta directors. So when benzene is nitrated, it forms nitrobenzene, which has the nitro group in the para position? No, wait, no. Wait, in the first nitration, the product is nitrobenzene, which is the meta product? Or wait, nitro is a strong meta director, but when benzene is nitrated, the product is nitrobenzene, which is the meta product? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. When benzene is nitrated, the nitro group can enter either the ortho, meta, or para positions, but the major product is nitrobenzene, which is the para isomer? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up. No, wait, in nitration of benzene, the product is a mix of ortho, meta, and para, but the major product is para? Or is meta more favored? Oh wait, I think meta is the major product because nitro is a meta director. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when benzene is nitrated, the nitro group is a strong meta director, but since benzene is symmetric, the nitration of benzene leads to a single product, which is nitrobenzene. Wait, but wait, no, that can't be. No, after nitration, the product is nitrobenzene, which is the meta isomer. Or am I getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para substitution, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when benzene is nitrated, the product is nitrobenzene (para isomer) as major. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the nitration mechanism. The nitronium ion is the electrophile. Benzene attacks the nitronium ion, leading to the formation of a sigma complex. The nitro group can end up in any position, but the most stable sigma complex is when the nitro group is in the para position? Or wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group, which makes the ring less reactive. Wait, but in the first substitution, the nitro group adds to the benzene ring, and it's the meta director because it's a strong deactivating group. So
