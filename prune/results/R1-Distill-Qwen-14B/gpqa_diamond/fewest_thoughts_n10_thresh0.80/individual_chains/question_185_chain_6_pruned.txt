Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator given. The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. Hmm, I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, right?

Wait, Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. When you take the dot product with n, you get something like n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ε, a constant with energy units.

I think the eigenvalues of a spin operator like σ·n should relate to the spin itself. Oh right, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Because each Pauli matrix squares to the identity matrix, so their eigenvalues are ±1. So if we have σ·n, which is a linear combination of them, what's its eigenvalue?

Wait, the eigenvalues of σ·n would be ±1 because the magnitude of the vector (since n is a unit vector) is 1. Oh wait, I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The operator σ·n is a spin component in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of any component of σ should be ±1. So if H is ε times that, then the eigenvalues of H would be ε times ±1, so ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but I remember that spin matrices are often scaled with ħ/2. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. The Pauli matrices themselves are just the σ_i, not multiplied by anything. But in some contexts, like when considering spin operators, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So S·n would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in this question, H is ε multiplied by σ·n. So if the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1, then H would have eigenvalues ±ε.

So the options are:

A) ±1: No, because it's multiplied by ε.

B) ±ε: Yes, that's what I think.

C) ± ε ħ/2: Hmm, that would be if the Pauli matrices were multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the question says the components of σ are the Pauli spin matrices. So each σ_i is the actual
