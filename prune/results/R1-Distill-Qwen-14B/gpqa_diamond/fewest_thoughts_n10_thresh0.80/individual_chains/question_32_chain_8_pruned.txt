Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember from my studies that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we have to use the theory of relativity, specifically the equations related to kinetic energy. The problem gives me the speed v as 0.96c, so I'll need to calculate the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC. I think RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold nuclei, but in this problem, it's nucleus X defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium. So the isotope would be Li-6, right? Because Li typically has 3 protons, so 3 neutrons would make it Li-6 (since 3+3=6). So the nucleus is Li-6.

I need to find the total energy, which in particle physics is usually the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I should calculate gamma first.

Let me compute beta, which is v/c. Beta here is 0.96. So beta squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c².
