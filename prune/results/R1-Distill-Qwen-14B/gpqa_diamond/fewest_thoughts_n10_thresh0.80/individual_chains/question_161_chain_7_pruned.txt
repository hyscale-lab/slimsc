Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Mike is designing a high-resolution TEM that operates at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment to improve the electron microscopy. But even with that, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is based on factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. But when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed something interesting. The mean free path changed from λ1 to λ2. The temperature stayed the same, so that's not the reason for the change.

I need to figure out what λ2 is relative to λ1. The options are A to D. 

Hmm, let me think about what the mean free path depends on. The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I remember the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the mean collision diameter, and P is pressure. Alternatively, another formula I've heard is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * n), where n is the number density. Since pressure P is nRT, another way to write it is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2) * (1/(P/ (RT))) ). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas.

Wait, another approach. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure and proportional to the temperature. But why would turning on the electron beam change the mean free path? The temperature is the same, so maybe it's not about thermal factors.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at high speeds. Maybe the gas molecules are getting ionized or something. Oh, right! In an electron microscope, the electron beam can cause interactions with the sample and the surrounding gas molecules. One such interaction is electron scattering, but another is ionization of the gas molecules. 

If the gas molecules are ionized
