Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Let's see what the question says. 

Alright, the setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. And the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the speed of light in different media, the index of refraction plays a role. In a vacuum, light speed is c, which is given as 1 here. So in the glass, the speed of light should be c/n, but wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass, right?

But the glass itself is moving. So I think I need to apply some kind of velocity addition formula here because the glass is moving relative to the lab frame. Oh wait, but wait... In special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. It's not as simple as adding v to the speed in the glass.

Wait, but the speed of light in any inertial frame is always c. That's one of Einstein's postulates. So regardless of the motion of the source or the medium, the speed of light measured in any inertial frame should be c. 

Wait, but does the medium's motion affect the speed? Like, if the medium is moving, does that change how we see the light's speed? I'm a bit confused. Let's think. In classical mechanics, velocities just add, but relativity changes that.

Wait, in this problem, the glass is moving towards the observer. So, when the glass is moving, the light emitted from it would have its speed measured as c in the lab frame. Because regardless of the glass's motion, the speed of light in the vacuum is c. But wait, the light is in the glass, not in a vacuum.

Wait, but the glass is a medium. So when the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of light inside it? Hmm. Oh, but wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. So the light is moving through the glass which is itself moving.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. The formula is v_medium = c/n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving
