Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with a certain index of refraction, n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially with light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, which is presumably much less than the speed of light. Oh wait, but the speed of light in a medium like glass is v = c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer. So, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement.

I'm a bit confused. So the glass is moving at speed v towards the observer. The light is in the glass, so from the lab frame, what's the speed of that light?

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving with speed v. So the light's speed in the glass would be c/n, but from the lab's perspective, how does the motion of the glass affect the light's speed?

Wait, I think I should consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula that tells you how velocities transform between different frames of reference.

The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² ). Wait, but wait a second, normally this formula is for when you're transforming from a frame moving at speed v relative to the lab frame. So if the lab is the rest frame and the glass is moving at speed v, then the speed of light in the glass would be affected by that.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The speed of light in the medium (glass) is v_medium = c/n. But from the lab frame, which sees the glass moving at speed v, what's the observed speed of the light?

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at speed v towards the lab observer. So we need to apply the velocity transformation formula to find the speed of the light as seen from the lab.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula is for when you have a frame moving at speed v relative to the lab. So if the glass is moving at speed v, then in its rest frame, the light is moving at u. So to find u' (the speed in the lab frame), we use the formula.

So u' = [u + v] / [1 + (u v)/(c²)].

Wait, but wait, in this case, the direction matters. If the glass is moving towards the observer, then the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So u in the glass's frame is c/n towards the observer. Then, when the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v, their velocities add.

So substituting u = c/n, and applying the formula:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: (1 + v/(n c) )

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Denominator: 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v/(n c)).

So the denominator is (n c + v )/(n c ) because 1 = (n c)/(n c), so adding v/(n c) gives (n c + v)/(n c).

So putting it all together:

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v
