Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. 

The problem says that we have a mixture of two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 ratio. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, so for the aromatic region, two singlets, each as a 1:1 ratio. And the other signals are probably from CH3 groups attached to something. Let's think about what each part means.

The molecular formula is C10H14. For benzene derivatives, the formula is usually CnH2n-6. Let me check: Benzene is C6H6. If each substituent is a methyl group (-CH3), each adds 3 carbons and takes away a hydrogen, but wait, the formula for each substituent is different. Wait, but for a benzene ring with methyl groups, each methyl adds a CH3, so the molecular formula would be C6 + number of CH3 groups. 

Wait, the given formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents add 4 carbons and 8 hydrogens (since 10-6=4 C, 14-6=8 H). Each methyl group is -CH3, which contributes 1 C and 3 H. So 4 C would mean 4 methyl groups. Because 4 methyl groups would add 4*(CH3) = 4 C and 12 H. Wait, that would make the formula C6 +4=10 C, and H:6 +12=18. But the given formula is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I should recalculate.

Wait, each substituent is a methyl group? Or maybe some are ethyl groups?

Wait, wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's do the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. Benzene has three (one ring plus three double bonds), each CH3 group doesn't add any. So the molecule must have one benzene ring and some substituents, probably methyl groups. But wait, let's check again. So C10H14: for benzene (C6H6), substituents account for 4 C and 8 H. So substituents are perhaps four methyl groups: 4*(CH3) adds 4 C and 12 H. That gives C6+4=10, H6+12=18. But our molecule has 14 H, so that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about substituents. Alternatively, maybe substitu
