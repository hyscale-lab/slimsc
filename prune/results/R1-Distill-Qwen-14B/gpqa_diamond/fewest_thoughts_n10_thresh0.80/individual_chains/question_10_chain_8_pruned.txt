Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see what the options are.

The question presents four options, a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of these. Let me first understand each option.

Option a says it's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth in both mass and radius. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this would be similar to Earth's density.

Option b is a planet with twice Earth's mass and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's the same density as Earth. So if its density is the same, but mass is double, what about its radius? Because density is mass divided by volume, and volume depends on radius cubed. If the density is the same as Earth, then a planet with twice Earth's mass would have a radius larger than Earth's. Because Volume = (4/3)πr³, so mass is density times volume. So if density is same, mass increases with volume, which is r³. So if mass doubles, radius would be cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. But the question here is about density, so option b's density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c: same composition as Earth but five times more massive. So if it's same composition, same density, right? Because density is mass/volume, and if the composition is same, then density should be same as Earth. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so this planet would also have 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, how does mass affect it? Well, if composition is same, the density is same regardless of mass. So option c's density is same as Earth, 5.5.

Option d: same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, same density as Earth, 5.5 g/cm³.

Wait, looking back, the options, so the question is which has the highest density. Now, let me see.

Wait, option b has a density of 5.5, same as Earth. Option c and d also have same density as Earth. So why are they options? Did I miss something?

Wait, looking again: option a is Earth-m
