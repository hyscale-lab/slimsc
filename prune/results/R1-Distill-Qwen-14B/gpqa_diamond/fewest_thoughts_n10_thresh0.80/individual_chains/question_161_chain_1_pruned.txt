Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopes and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, which is pretty high. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum—like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment because that helps with better electron microscopy images. But some gas particles are still there, and a mass spectrometer detected them.

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes—it's now λ2, which is different from λ1. But the temperature in the compartment is still the same, so that shouldn't have changed.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? The original mean free path λ1 was calculated under ultra-high vacuum conditions. But when the electron beam is active, maybe the conditions change a bit.

I remember that in electron microscopy, when the electron beam is on, it can cause various effects. One thing that comes to mind is electron-induced gas desorption. Oh, right, when high-energy electrons hit the sample or the chamber walls, they might knock out other molecules or atoms. But wait, in this case, the vacuum was already really good, so maybe the electron beam is somehow affecting the gas molecules.

Another possibility is that the electron beam causes ionization of the gas molecules. If the gas is ionized, the ions might behave differently. Ions have a charge, so they could interact more with the electron beam or other charged particles. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Mean free path is given by the formula λ = 1/(n * π * d^2), where n is the number density of the gas and d is the mean collision diameter. So if something changes n or d, λ would change.

Wait, but the pressure is already very low. n would be low too. So maybe the electron beam isn't directly changing the pressure, but perhaps the gas is getting heated or something else is happening.

Wait, but the temperature
