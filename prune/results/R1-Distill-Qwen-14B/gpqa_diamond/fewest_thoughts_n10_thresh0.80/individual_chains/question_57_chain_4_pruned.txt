Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scattering amplitude in electron-nucleus elastic collisions. Hmm, the question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that phase shifts are involved in partial wave expansions. 

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude... I think it's something like f(l,θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} e^{i l π} (e^{i k r} something). Oh wait, maybe the general expression is f(θ) = sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} ) * (something) ... wait, perhaps a better approach is to think of the partial wave expansion and the relation between the scattering amplitude and the phase shifts.

I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ)

Wait, no, more accurately, the real and imaginary parts come into play. But since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0 degrees. So cosθ would be 1, because cos(0) is 1.

Wait, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l, because P_l(1)=1. So when θ=0, each
