Okay, so I've got this physics problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let's try to think through it.

The problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-Î²E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), so it's like each state contributes a term based on its energy.

First, I should figure out all the possible states of the system. Since each spin has two options, +1 and -1, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. Okay, so we'll have to consider all 8 possible configurations of S1, S2, S3.

But wait, maybe some states have the same energy. That could help simplify things. Because if multiple states have the same energy, their contributions to Z would be the same, so we can group them.

Let me list all the possible states. Let's denote each as (S1, S2, S3):

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to calculate the energy E.

The energy formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute each term.

Let's go one by one.

1. State (+1, +1, +1):
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum = 3. So E = -J * 3 = -3J.

2. State (+1, +1, -1):
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum=1 -1 -1 = -1. E= -J*(-1) = J.

3. State (+1, -1, +1):
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

4. State (+1, -1, -1):
S1S2= -1
S1S3= -1
S2S3= (-1)*(-1)=1
Sum= -1 -1 +1= -1. E= J.

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, S2 and S3 are
