Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So when the star rotates, these spots come into view and then disappear, causing brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transiting the star.

The problem is asking: if the star wasn't spotty, what radius would an exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve? So they're comparing the effect of the spots to an exoplanet's transit.

Hmm, I remember that the light curve dip depends on the size of the blocking object relative to the star. For a planet transit, the dip is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. But in this case, it's not a single object; it's spots covering a part of the star.

Photometric variations from spots are a bit different because it's not a solid disk blocking light, but areas that are cooler. So the brightness change comes from the spots being dimmer than the rest of the star.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. But only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into our view, causing a dip in brightness.

But wait, when the star is viewed from Earth, the spots would rotate in and out. So the maximum area covered at any time would be the area of the spots on the hemisphere. But since the star's rotation is causing the spots to come into view, perhaps the modulation is due to the spots being on only one side.

But for the light curve, when the spots are facing us, the total brightness would be less than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. So the amplitude variation depends on the difference in brightness when the spots are visible versus not.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation resembles an exoplanet transit. So they want to find the planet radius that would give the same light
