Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. I remember that orthophosphate is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which is the second deprotonated form of phosphoric acid. So, phosphate (PO4^3-) is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-.

But wait, first, let's think about the salts we have here. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. It should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. Both of these are phosphate species, but they can interconvert in solution based on the pH.

Wait, but orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the next deprotonation step. So, how would we get PO4^3-? That would come from deprotonating HPO4^2- further. But for that to happen, the solution needs to be highly basic because the third dissociation has a very small Ka (1.8e-12), making PO4^3- very small in concentration unless the pH is very high.

Alternatively, maybe PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- in solution, but given the high pKa for the third step, it's not going to be a large concentration.

Wait, but let me think about the buffer system here. We have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. That's a buffer solution because they are a conjugate acid-base pair. The pH of this buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using the pKa2 value since the second dissociation is relevant here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So, first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

Let me calculate the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4:
Molar mass (MW) is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / MW = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O:
MW is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Na2HPO4·2H2O has a formula weight of (Na2HPO4 is 142.04 g/mol) plus 2*(H2O, 18.015)= 142.04 + 36.03 = 178.07 g/mol. The given MW is 177
