Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see. The problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct pH.

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. So first, I should probably calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the solution to see if it's acidic, basic, or neutral.

Let me break it down step by step. Each of these solutions contributes to the H+ or OH- concentration. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely, giving H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

First, let me find the moles of each component in each solution.

Starting with CH3COOH (acetic acid). The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl is next. Volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 L. 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it'll donate 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 has a volume of 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So I should calculate the total H+ and total OH-.

Wait, but the acetic acid is a weak acid. So for that, I can't just take the moles as H+ because it doesn't fully dissociate. So I need to consider that. HCl, though, is a strong acid and will contribute all its H+.

But wait, the problem is that when you mix all these together, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other. The acetic acid's H+ might also get neutralized, but maybe not all of it. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Calculate the moles of H+ contributed by HCl.
2. Calculate the moles of
