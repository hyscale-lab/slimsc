Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first I should remember what each of these symmetries means and how SMEFT works. SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. Effective theories usually extend the SM by adding these higher-dimension terms, but they must respect the same fundamental symmetries as the SM.

So, what symmetries does the Standard Model respect? The SM is Lorentz invariant, right? So all its operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry because they're part of the same framework. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Wait, but I think the Standard Model already respects Poincare, so SMEFT would too. But wait, are the SMEFT operators adding terms that respect Poincare? Or is that automatically taken care of?

Wait, I'm a bit confused between Lorentz and Poincare. Lorentz symmetry is about rotations and boosts, while Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But in a field theory, all operators must be Poincare invariant because they're part of a local theory with translation invariance. So, if an operator doesn't respect translations, like having a specific momentum dependence, that wouldn't make sense in a local QFT. So Poincare symmetry would be included.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if all operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare, but wait, if Poincare includes Lorentz, then perhaps the correct point is that operators automatically respect Lorentz symmetry if they respect Poincare. But I think the question is asking which are the required symmetries that must be respected, regardless of each other.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the SMEFT framework. The SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimension operators that are Lorentz-invariant and respect the gauge symmetries of the SM. So SMEFT operators
