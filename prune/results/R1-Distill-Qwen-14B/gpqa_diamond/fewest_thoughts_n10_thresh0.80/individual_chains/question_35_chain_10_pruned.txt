Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says that the operator A_y is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h divided by 4π. The matrix S has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So, let me write down what matrix Ay looks like.

First, c is h/(4π), so:

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So multiplying each element by c:

The (1,1) element is 0 * c = 0.

(1,2) is -i * c = -i * h/(4π)

(2,1) is i * c = i * h/(4π)

(2,2) is 0 * c = 0.

So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Eigenvalues are found by solving Ay φ = a φ, which leads to the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me set that up. The matrix Ay minus a times the identity matrix is:

[ -a, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part:

(-a)(-a) = a².

The other term: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) 

But wait, (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1.

So that term becomes (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

So the determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Setting this equal to zero gives a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a can be h/(4π) or -h/(4π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait a second. Because the matrix S, when multiplied by c, gives Ay. Oh, but wait, S is the spin-1/2 operator. Spin matrices usually have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, in this case, S is given as having this matrix form, so perhaps it's the Pauli matrices or something similar.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. For σy, the matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches S here. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, σy. So, S is the Pauli matrix for y.

In that case, the eigenvalues of S would be ±1, since Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. But wait, no, wait. No, for spin-1/2 systems, the spin matrices Sx, Sy, Sz have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 when multiplied by the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the actual spin matrices for spin-1/2 are given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So, for example, Sx = (ħ/2) σx, and so on.

But in this problem, the operator Ay is c multiplied by S, and c is h/(4π). Let me think. Let me compute c * S.

Wait, because S is the Pauli matrix σy, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by the eigenvalues of σy, which are ±1.

So the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * 1 = h/(4π) and (h/(4π)) * (-1) = -h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. Let me think again about the setup. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed σy. So when S is multiplied by (h/(4π)), that gives the operator Ay.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are (h/(4π)) times the eigenvalues of S. Since S has eigenvalues ±1,
