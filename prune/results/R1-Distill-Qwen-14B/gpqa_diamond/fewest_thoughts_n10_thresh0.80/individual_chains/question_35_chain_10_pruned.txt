Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, okay, let's see what I can do. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c * S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So S looks like this:

0   -i
i    0

Okay, so the first thing I need to do is find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix A_y. Then, I have to look at the options given and pick the correct statement.

Let me write down the matrix A_y. Since c = h/(4π), each element of S is multiplied by c. So,

A_y = (h/(4π)) * S = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

So the matrix is:

[ 0,      -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0       ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

The matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[ -a,           -i h/(4π)    ]
[ i h/(4π),    -a          ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Calculating that:

= a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, let's compute (-i)*(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so negative of that is 1.

So the determinant becomes a² - [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ] = a² - (h²)/(16 π²) =0.

So equation is a² = (h²)/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). Wait, that's interesting. Because h/(4π) is the value of c.

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right? They are ±c, since c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are purely real.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't fit with what I found. Because here, the eigenvalues are purely real. So option A's eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which doesn't fit. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Also seems off because my calculation says they are real. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az. Hmm, wait. A squared, the operator squared, would have eigenvalues a squared, which would be (h²)/(16 π²). Since the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A² (because for angular momentum operators, L² and L_z don't commute with L_x or L_y, but L² commutes with any component, I think). Wait, but in this case, since A is a spin-½ particle, the operator A² would have eigenvalues ( (ħ)^2 s(s+1) ), where s=1/2. So A² would have eigenvalues ħ² (½)(½+1) = (3/4) ħ².

Wait, but in our problem, A_y is a component of the angular momentum, but for a muon, which has spin 1/2, so A² would have eigenvalues ( (ħ)^2 ) ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ) = 3 ħ²/4. So the eigenfunctions of Ay would have the same eigenfunctions as A², since A² commutes with Ay. Because [A², Ay] =0, because A² is the sum of squares of all components, including Ay.

Wait, but why wouldn't the eigenfunctions of Ay also be eigenfunctions of Az? Because Ay and Az don't commute. The commutator [Ay, Az] would be iħ times something? Let me think. The angular momentum components satisfy [Lx, Ly] = iħ Lz. So in this case, [Ay, Az] would be iħ A... Wait, no, the commutator for components of angular momentum is [L_i, L_j] = iħ ε_ijk L_k. So [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x? Because ε_{y z x} is 1. So this commutator is non-zero, which means Ay and Az do not share eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. But they can be eigenfunctions of A², since A² commutes with all components.

So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Which seems correct. So C is a possible correct option.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure what that means. The basis functions are like the eigenvectors. So if the operator is 2x2, it acts on a two-dimensional space. Its eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So statement D is correct? Or is it saying something else?

Wait, the statement says, "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, perhaps that's correct, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it's acting on a two-dimensional vector space. The eigenvectors will form a basis for this space. So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) φ are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's look back at the options.

Now, the options are for what is correct during the calculation. So, let's evaluate each statement.

Option A: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But the eigenvalues are purely real, so A is wrong.

Option B: Same issue as A, wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. As I thought earlier, since [A², Ay] =0, they share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, any operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space if they are complete. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors are two orthogonal vectors, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the problem says "which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation." So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, the correct answer is one of these letters.

Wait, but let me reevaluate the eigenvalues. I found a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So options A and B are wrong because they suggest complex eigenvalues, which is not the case.

So the correct options are C and D. But looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, let me think again about option D. "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the eigenvectors are the basis functions for the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis for the space. So yes, D is correct. But then why is option C correct?

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C
