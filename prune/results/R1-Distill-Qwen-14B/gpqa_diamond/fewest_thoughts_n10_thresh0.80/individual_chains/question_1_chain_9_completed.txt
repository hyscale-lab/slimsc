Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE_diff = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is that the energy resolution required is ΔE_res ≈ ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made. But since the lifetimes of the two states are different, maybe we have to consider which time is relevant.

Wait, perhaps the time available for measurement is the same as the shorter lifetime, because if one state decays faster, the other lasts longer. Wait, no, that's probably not the case. Let me think again.

The energy-time uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, where Δt is the time during which the energy is measured. So to have a good resolution, we need a measurement time that's not too long, but probably in this problem, the time is given by the lifetimes of the states.

Wait, maybe each state has its own energy uncertainty. So the first state has ΔE1 = ħ/τ1, and the second has ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. So to resolve the two, the energy difference should be bigger than the sum of these two uncertainties. So ΔE_diff > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, the two states' energy intervals might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2 using the given lifetimes.

The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 sec, τ2 = 1e-8 sec.

So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J.

Wait, but that's in joules; I need to convert it to eV. 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J.

So 1.05e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.55e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert that to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 6.55e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.55e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.55e-8 eV.

The sum of uncertainties is about 7.2e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV for them to be clearly resolved.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is much smaller than 7.2e-7 → too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → much smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → much larger than 7.2e-7. So that's good.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is less than 7.2e-7. So this would not satisfy the condition.

Wait, but wait: I assumed that the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Alternatively, perhaps it's just the individual uncertainties. Let me think.

Each state's energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. So the two energy levels must be spaced such that the distance between them is greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Or perhaps each must be spaced beyond their own uncertainty. Hmm, but if you have two nearby lines, each with a certain width, the minimum distance to resolve them is when the distance is more than the sum of their half-widths.

Wait, in spectroscopy, the resolving power is such that two lines can be resolved if the distance between them is greater than the sum of their linewidths (or half of it, depending on convention). So for two lines with widths ΔE1 and ΔE2, the minimum separation is ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Alternatively, sometimes the criterion is based on the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the separation must be at least the sum of the half-widths. So yes, |E2 - E1| ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

In that case, the required minimum energy difference is about 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 0.0001 eV is larger than 7.2e-7 eV (which is 0.00000072 eV). So option C is way larger than needed.

But wait, the problem is asking which one could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. So the correct option is C.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.60217663e-19 J. So,

ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 / 1.60217663e-19 ≈ (1.05457e-25) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

ΔE2 in eV is 1.0545718e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So sum is 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be larger than this, say around 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 0.0001 is bigger than 7.2e-7, so yes, that's enough.

The other options are smaller. So the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy uncertainty and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For two states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the energy uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60217663 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \, \text{J} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \, \text{J} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{diff}} = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is also much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly resolve the two energy levels.
