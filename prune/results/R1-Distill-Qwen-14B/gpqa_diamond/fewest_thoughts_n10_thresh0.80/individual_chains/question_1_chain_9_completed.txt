Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve them, the energy difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So ΔE_diff = |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach is that the energy resolution required is ΔE_res ≈ ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the measurement is made. But since the states have different lifetimes, perhaps the measurement time is related to the shorter of the two lifetimes? Or maybe the time it takes to measure the energy difference.

Alternatively, maybe each state's energy uncertainty is ħ divided by its own lifetime. So the uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/τ2.

So to resolve them, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of these uncertainties. So |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the two energy levels are so close that their uncertainties overlap, you can't tell them apart. So the minimal ΔE to resolve them is when ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me plug in the numbers. τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

So ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9) = (approx 1e-34 J·s) / 1e-9 s) = 1e-25 J.

But wait, converting J to eV. 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So 1e-25 J is (1e-25) / (1.6e-19) eV ≈ 6.25e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8 s) = 1e-26 J. Which is 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 6.25e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 6.25e-8 eV.

So the sum is approximately 6.25e-7 + 6.25e-8 = 6.875e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than 6.875e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A)1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6. That's way smaller than 6.8e-7. Not enough.

B)1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C)1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. That's way larger than 6.875e-7. So that's okay.

D)1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8. Wait, 1e-8 is 1e-8 eV. Let me see: 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. Wait, 6.875e-7 is 0.0000006875 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is 10 times smaller than 6.875e-7. So 1e-8 is less than the required sum of uncertainties. So option D is not enough.

Wait, so the minimal ΔE is about 6.875e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than that.

So which options are greater than 6.875e-7 eV? Let's see:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way bigger than 6.875e-7. So it's acceptable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is less than 6.875e-7. Not enough.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C. So the correct answer is option C.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties. The energy uncertainty for each state is determined by the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E_i \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_i},
\]

where \( \tau_i \) is the lifetime of the \( i \)-th state. For the given lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Similarly, for \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, evaluate the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
