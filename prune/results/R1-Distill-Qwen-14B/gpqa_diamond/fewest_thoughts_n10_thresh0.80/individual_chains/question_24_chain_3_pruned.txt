Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about some reactions involving mixtures X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's take it piece by piece.

First, the problem says that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the mixture has unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes, which can react with Br2. So, X has two liquids, both unsaturated.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids, which resulted from a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation implies that one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So, probably, one of the components in X is undergoing this reaction. Also, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, meaning the products are more saturated, maybe alkanes or something else without double bonds.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they both give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%, and it's part of Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which suggests it's an alkane, as alkanes are saturated and don't react with H2 under normal conditions.

Wait, so both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same Z. That's interesting. So, perhaps X and Y have the same hydrogenation product because they're related in some way.

Z's H mass fraction is 14.28%. Let me find out what that is. 14.28% is roughly 1/7, since 14.28 is approximately 100/7. So the mass percent of H is about 1/7. Let's think about possible hydrocarbons. The formula could be CnH2n+2, which is an alkane, as I thought earlier.

The mass percent of H is (2n+2)/(12n + 2) * 100 = 14.28. Let me calculate that.

Let me set up the equation: (2n + 2) / (12n + 2) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator: 2n+2 = 0.1428*(12n +2).

Calculate the right side: 0.1428 *12n is 1.7136n, 0.1428*2 is 0.2856. So 2n + 2 = 1.7136n + 0.2856.

Subtract 1.7136n from both sides: (2n -1.7136n) + 2 = 0.2856 → (0.2864n) + 2 = 0.2856.

Subtract 2: 0.2864n = -1.7144. Wait, that can't be right because n can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about possible hydrocarbons. Let's try n=5: C5H12. The molecular weight is 5*12 +12 =60 +12=72. The H mass fraction is 12/(72) = 16.666...%, which is higher than 14.28%. So not C5H12.

Wait, maybe n=6: C6H14. Mw=6*12 +14=72+14=86. H's mass is 14/86≈16.28%. Still higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a different formula. Wait, maybe the molecular formula is not CnH2n+2. Maybe I made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is something else. Let me recheck the mass fraction calculation.

Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7, which is about 0.1428. So,

(2n +2) / (12n +2) = 1/7.

Cross multiply: 7*(2n+2) = 12n + 2.

14n +14 =12n +2.

14n -12n = 2-14 → 2n = -12 → n= -6. That can't be right. Hmm. So maybe my initial assumption about the formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane? Let me think, but cycloalkanes are similar to alkanes in terms of hydrogen content. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the formula.

Wait another approach: Let's think about possible hydrocarbons where the H% is 14.28. Let's calculate:

14.28% is 14.28 g H per 100
