Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of charges and their potential energy. I've done some problems like this before, but I'm a bit rusty, so let me think through this step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to consider kinetic energy or forces related to mass, just electric potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is: one charge is at point P, and twelve are arranged around it, each 2 meters away. I guess they form a sort of spherical arrangement around P since they're all at the same distance.

The question asks for the minimum energy of this system. Oh, wait, but potential energy is a scalar, so I'm assuming it's the electric potential energy of the system. Since the system is isolated, internal energy changes are considered, I think.

Now, how do I calculate the potential energy for a system of charges? I remember that the potential energy of a configuration of point charges is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to all the other charges already placed. But since all the charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe there's a formula for that.

Wait, but all the charges are 2e. Let me list the charges:

- Charge at P: 2e (fixed)
- Twelve charges at 2m from P: each is 2e.

Wait, but in calculating the potential energy, I need to consider the interactions between each pair of charges. But wait, the charge at P is fixed, so maybe the potential energy due to that charge's interactions with the others contributes as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum over all pairs of (q_i q_j / r_ij). Since all the charges are identical, maybe I can calculate this more simply.

So each of the 12 charges at 2m from P is 2e, and the charge at P is 2e. So the interactions are between the central charge and each of the 12, and between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges.

Wait, but wait—if the twelve charges are all at the same point (but no, they're each at 2m from P, but their arrangement isn't specified beyond that. Are they all at the same point? No, wait, they're each at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other may vary. But since the problem states that they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps they form a spherical shell around P. So each of the 12 is spaced around P on a sphere of radius 2m.

But for the potential energy, the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be less than 4m, but I don't know exactly how. But wait, maybe it's easier to model this as the central charge and each of the 12 being identical, so let me think about the potential energy contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy due to the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, but not the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. Because if they're identical, the problem might be simplified, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum is achieved when all the surrounding charges are as close as possible, but in this case, they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps that's why it's fixed. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

So, the potential energy U of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So, each pair contributes (1/(4πε₀)) * (q
