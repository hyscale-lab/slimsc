Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. So, both planets have about the same mass. But the RV shifts detected are different. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but since they can detect it, the inclination must be such that we see the Doppler shift), and the orbital period. Oh, right, but the exact formula is something I need to remember.

I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. Let me try to recall the exact expression. Oh yes, I think the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (4π²)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )) * [ (1 / c ) ] * (1 / sin i )

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's, M_p can be neglected compared to M_star, so it simplifies. So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) * sin i ) maybe? Or wait, perhaps it's (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not exactly sure about the exponents. Alternatively, another approach is to think about the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital motion. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass, so the star's velocity is v = (2π a) / P, where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass. But since the star's mass is much larger, a is approximately equal to (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) )^(1/3) * (G P²/(4π²)) )^(1/3) )? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, I remember that the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) ) * ( (P / 1 year )^(-1/3) ) / ( (M_star / M_sun )^(2/3) ) )

Wait, not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula K =
