Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Then each product undergoes some reactions, and the question is about the number of carbons in the final product, product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

First, I need to recall what each of these reactions does. Let me think about each step.

Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1. I remember that methylmagnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups. So cinnamaldehyde has a carbonyl group, right? The structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached via a propenyl group, and the trans configuration on the double bond.

So when Grignard adds to an aldehyde, the aldehyde has RCHO, and Grignard (R'MgX) adds twice? Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, no, wait: Grignard reagents add once to ketones and aldehydes because they're nucleophilic. Wait, aldehydes have the structure RCHO. When Grignard reagent attacks, it adds to the carbonyl carbon, giving an alkoxide which then gets protonated during workup.

Wait, but wait, for an aldehyde, the Grignard would add once, making RCH2-O-MgBr, and then after workup (acid), it becomes RCH2OH. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. The aldehyde is RCHO. Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so the Grignard (CH3MgBr) would add to the carbonyl carbon, making RCH(Oâˆ’)CH2-MgBr. Then, after workup (adding acid), it would become RCH2CH2OH? No, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, no. Aldehydes have the carbonyl group (CHO). Grignard reagents add twice to ketones because they can't form a stable enolate easily, but wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm confusing ketones and aldehydes. For ketones, Grignard adds once because the carbonyl group is R2CO. For aldehydes, which are RCHO, the Grignard would add once as well, but then after workup, you get RCH2OH. Wait, no, because an aldehyde has only one R group. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait, wait. The structure of cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, wait. Wait, perhaps I should think of it correctly. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal. Its structure is Ph-CH2-CHO? No
