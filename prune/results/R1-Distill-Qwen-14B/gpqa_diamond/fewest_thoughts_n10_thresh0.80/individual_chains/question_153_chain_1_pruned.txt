Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, so the Michael donor (the nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor (the unsaturated carbonyl), forming a new carbon-carbon bond. 

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I'll need to figure out each one's products and then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate are reacting under NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, what's happening here?

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. It's a diester with two ester groups. The structure is like CH2(CO2Me)2. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the E configuration. Wait, no, wait. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituents on the double bond in the trans configuration. So the structure is CH2-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCO2R. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be in the middle carbon. So, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 2. So structure is CH2=CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Hmm, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCO₂R. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=C(p-tolyl)CO₂Me? No, wait, the numbering. For acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, so 3 would be the next carbon. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO₂Me. Oh wait, but wait, the substituent on the double bond is on which position? Alternatively, maybe it's CH₂=C(p-tolyl)CO₂Me, but that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂-CH(CO₂Me)-CH₂-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate being CH₂=CH-CO-OCH2-p-t
