Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, creating an enolate intermediate. So, it's a conjugate addition, right?

The problem has three parts, labeled A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to find out the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Let's start with part (A):

Reactants: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions.

Hmm, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate equivalent. Wait, no, wait—dimethyl malonate itself isn't the enolate, but under basic conditions, it can form an enolate. Wait, but in the presence of a base like NaOEt, which is a strong base, maybe the malonate serves as the nucleophile.

Wait, the Michael reaction typically involves a nucleophilic enolate attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate is the nucleophile, and the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the electrophile.

Wait, but here, the first reactant is dimethyl malonate. I think dimethyl malonate can act as the donor in a Michael addition. Because when you deprotonate it with a base, you get an enolate which can attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So in this case, the base is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. That's a deprotonating condition. So, the base would deprotonate dimethyl malonate at the alpha position (the position next to the carbonyl) to form an enolate. Then, this enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

The unsaturated ester given is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Structure-wise, that's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no—wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-O-. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3? Or wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the second carbon. Let me think: the structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, substituting on the middle carbon would make it 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate? So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3? Or wait, maybe it's between 2 and 3. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it.

The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So if the substituent is a p-tolyl group, then it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, wait, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Because the substituent is on the double bond. Oh, wait, "3-(p-tolyl)acrylate" would have the substituent on the third carbon. But acrylate has three carbons (CH
