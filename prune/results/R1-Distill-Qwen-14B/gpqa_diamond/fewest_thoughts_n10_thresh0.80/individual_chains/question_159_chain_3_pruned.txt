Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. The question is about the comoving distance of this quasar given the Lambda-CDM model parameters.

Hmm, I remember that the peak in the spectrum could be related to the Lyman-alpha forest or something else, but wait, Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm. Oh wait, the Lyman series transitions are in the UV. So 790 nm is in the infrared. Wait, another thought: the Balmer series. The Balmer-alpha line is the H-alpha line, which is at about 656 nm. So 790 is a bit longer than that. Hmm, perhaps it's the Paschen series? Let's see, the Paschen-alpha line is around 820 nm. Oh, that's close. So maybe the peak is from the Paschen-alpha emission line of hydrogen.

If that's the case, then the redshift z of the quasar would relate to the observed wavelength. The rest wavelength for Paschen-alpha is about 820 nm, but wait, wait. The rest wavelength for the Lyman series is 121 nm, Balmer (H-alpha) is 656 nm, and then the Paschen series starts at 820 nm. Oh wait, but the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is shorter than 820. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. No, if the observed wavelength is longer than the rest, it's redshifted. If it's shorter, it's blueshifted, which is rare. So if the rest wavelength is 820 nm and the observed is 790, that's blueshifted. That's unlikely because quasars are usually moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe. So maybe I messed up the series.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Lyman series. The Lyman-alpha line is 121 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer, so that would imply a redshift.

Wait, the formula for redshift is (observed wavelength) = (rest wavelength) * (1 + z). So for Lyman-alpha, rest is 121 nm. If observed is 790, then 790 = 12
