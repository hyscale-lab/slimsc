Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. It's about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributedâ€”so I guess that means their distribution in space is uniform, not clustered. Wait, but how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a larger parallax means a closer star.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, if I consider a small range in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is constant. So the number of stars should depend on the volume of space they occupy. But parallax relates to distance, so I need to connect the two.

Let me think about the volume around us. Stars at a distance d have a certain volume. As you go further out, the volume increases. But wait, since parallax is 1/d, when d increases, plx decreases. So the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on how much volume corresponds to that parallax range.

Wait, the volume in a spherical shell. The volume of a shell between distance d and d +
