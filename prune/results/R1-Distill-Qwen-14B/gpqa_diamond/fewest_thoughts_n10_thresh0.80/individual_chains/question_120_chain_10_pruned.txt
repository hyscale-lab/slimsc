Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work it out.

Alright, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. I think that means their density is the same everywhere. So, they spread out uniformly in space. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Right, because parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how many stars fall into a slice of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. And how does that number change with plx.

I remember that when objects are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume. So if I have a shell or a spherical volume element at a certain distance, the number of stars depends on the volume of that shell.

So, the volume of a spherical shell at radius d (which is 1/plx) with thickness dd is the surface area times the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd. But wait, since we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/d, maybe I should express it in terms of plx.

Let me define plx = p, so d = 1/p. The volume element in terms of p. Let's see, when d increases by dd, p changes by dp. So, since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. Oh, but since we're dealing with a positive change, maybe I can write it as dd = (1/p²) dp when p decreases. Hmm, not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.

Wait, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV.

But what's the volume when considering a small change in parallax? Let's think about it. For a fixed parallax p, the distance d is 1/p. So, a small change in p would correspond to a small change in d. The volume between d and d + dd would be the volume of a spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd. So that's 4πd² dd.

But since d = 1/p, we can write d in terms of p. So, d = 1/p → dd = (-1/p²) dp. Wait, but since the parallax p is inversely related to distance, when p increases, d decreases. So when p increases, the shell is at a smaller distance.

But for the number of stars in a parallax range, we're considering a small change in p, so dp, but the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (dd). But since dd is related to dp, let's substitute. So, dd = (d d p) / (dp) ? Wait, maybe I should express the volume in terms of p.

Alternatively, think of the volume element in terms
