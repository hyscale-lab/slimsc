Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question says that two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, have their radii and masses each in a 1.5:1 ratio. So Star_1 is larger and more massive. The spectroscopy shows their brightest wavelengths are the same, which probably means they have the same temperature. Oh wait, because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law, which depends on the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us much. Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but I'm not sure how that plays into luminosity here. Hmm.

The problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So luminosity formula for a star as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, maybe we can ignore other factors.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). But from the problem, R1 is 1.5 R2, and T1 is T2 because the peak wavelengths are the same. So T1 = T2. So L1/L2 is ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T^4 ) ) = ( (2.25 R2²) ) / ( R2² ) ) = 2.25. So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but why is the radial velocity given? Oh wait, radial velocity affects the observed flux, but the question is about the computed luminosity, not the observed flux. Because luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, not what we observe. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't affect the calculation here. Because the question says, "they computed the luminosity" based on black body radiation. So the Doppler effect might change the observed wavelength, but since they're using the black body assumption and presumably correcting for that, perhaps the velocities don't factor into the calculation of luminosity.

Alternatively, if they didn't correct for velocity, but since radial velocity affects the observed temperature via Doppler shifting, maybe that comes into play. Let me think.

If the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted. But when we use that wavelength to calculate temperature via Wien's law, T = (hc)/(λ_max k) * (1/(slope factor? )) Wait, no, Wien's displacement law is λ_max * T = constant. So if the star is moving, the observed λ is shifted, but when calculating T, we might correct for that. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength would be Doppler-shifted. But because the astronomers found that the peak wavelengths are the same, maybe they have accounted for the Doppler effect? So in their analysis, they would correct for the radial velocity to get the actual temperature.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So they measured the same λ_max for both stars. But if one star is moving, the measured λ would differ from the rest frame λ. So to get the same observed λ_max, their actual temperatures must differ? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's re-examine. The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So without considering any Doppler shifts, T would be the same. But if the star is moving, the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ would be longer. But in the problem
