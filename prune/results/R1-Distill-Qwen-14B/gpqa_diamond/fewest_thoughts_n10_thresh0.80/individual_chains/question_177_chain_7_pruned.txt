Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. So, radius R1 = 1.5 R2, and mass M1 = 1.5 M2. 

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Now, the stars are considered as black bodies. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio depends on the radius squared.

The problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity should be 2.25 times greater for Star_1.

Wait, but wait a minute! The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Oh, wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. How does that affect luminosity?

Hmm, I'm not sure. Because luminosity is intrinsic brightness, not affected by the star's velocity. Unless... Wait, Doppler shift could affect the observed wavelength, but since the question already states that the peak wavelengths are the same (so they must have same T). Because if Star 2 is moving towards or away, its observed wavelength would shift, but the problem says the peak wavelengths are same. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't affect the calculation here because the observed wavelengths match, which implies that any Doppler shift is accounted for, meaning T is same.

So the radial velocities might be a red herring. The problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on the black body radiation, which would be based on intrinsic properties (R and T). Since T is same, and R1 is 1.5 R2, L1 should be (1.5)^2 times L2, which is 2.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.25, option D is 2.23. Wait, but wait, is there any other factor I'm missing? Like, does mass play any role here?

In the Stefan-Boltzmann law, mass doesn't directly come into play. Only R and T matter. But wait, the masses are both 1.5 times, but mass doesn't directly affect luminosity in this context. Luminosity is about energy output, which depends on radius and temperature.

So, I'm confident that the
