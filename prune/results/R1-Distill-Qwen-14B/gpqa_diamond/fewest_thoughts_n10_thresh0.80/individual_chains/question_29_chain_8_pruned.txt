Okay, so I've got this question about barley genetics and mutations. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the first exon area.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the idea is probably that the gene product (maybe an enzyme) is making this compound. If we mutate the gene, we might disrupt its function, thus stopping the compound's production.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change in the first exon. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, but I remember that exons are the coding regions of genes. So mutations in exons could affect the protein structure.

The intact gene is provided, and each mutant has a different change. Wait, the sequences are a bit long, but I can look for the differences.

Let me compare each mutant's sequence with the intact one. 

Intact:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So let's see, the change is in the first part. The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCG... and Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTACG... Let me look at the exact point. Wait, the first part after ATG in the intact is TTTCTCG. In Mutant 1, it's TTCTACG. Wait, maybe a substitution or a deletion? Or perhaps an indel.

Wait, maybe I should look for where the change starts. Let me count the nucleotides.

Intact: position 4-8: T T C T C G
Mutant 1: T T C T A C G ... Wait, no, that might not make sense. Or perhaps it's a substitution at a certain position. Alternatively, maybe it's a point mutation.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each position.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look for where in the sequence the changes occur. The question states that the mutations are in the first exon area, so perhaps the changes are in the exons.

But actually, in this case, since it's the first exon, all the mutations would affect the coding sequence.

Wait, but the question is about which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That is, which mutation would disrupt the function of the gene. So, any mutation that causes a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), or a missense mutation that disrupts the structure/function of the protein.

Looking at the options:

Intact: ...TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1: ...TGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, the last part of the sequence shows a change. In the intact, it's ...GTCGT... and in Mutant 1, it's ...GTCGC... So at the end, the last C is changed to G? Or wait, looking at the last part, the intact ends with ...GTCGT..., while Mutant 1 ends with ...GTCGC... Hmm, maybe that's a mutation in the last codon of the exon?

Wait, no, the 'TGA' at the end is the stop codon. So the actual coding sequence ends before that.

Wait, perhaps I should check each mutant:

Mutant 1: Sequence ends with ...GTCGC. So in the last codon before the stop, it's CG. The last codon is GTC, which is Val, and in Mutant 1, it's
