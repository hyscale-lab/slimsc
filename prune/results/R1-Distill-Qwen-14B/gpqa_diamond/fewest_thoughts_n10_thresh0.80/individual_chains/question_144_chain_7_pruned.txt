Okay, so I have this physics problem about a meson resonance and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters.

Wait, mean decay distance... Oh right, when a particle decays, the mean lifetime relates to how far it travels before decaying. But I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh, right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, let's think. The mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think Γ is the total decay width, and τ is the inverse of Γ multiplied by some factors. Oh wait, τ = ħ / Γ. Right, because the uncertainty principle says that the energy-time uncertainty is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, so for a resonance, the width Γ is like ΔE, so Δt is approximately ħ / Γ. That should be the lifetime τ.

But wait, in natural units, ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ here is given in MeV, so I need to convert units.
