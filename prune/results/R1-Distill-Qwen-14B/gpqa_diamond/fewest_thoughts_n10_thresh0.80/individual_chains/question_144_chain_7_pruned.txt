Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (Lorentz factor) multiplied by velocity, but maybe I'm mixing up some terms.

Oh right, the mean decay length L is given by L = c * gamma * beta * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c.

But wait, how do I find tau? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle: Γ ≈ ħ / tau, so tau ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, units are important here. Let me get the units right.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau using the width Γ.
2. Find the velocity beta of the meson.
3. Compute the Lorentz factor gamma.
4. Use L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

Let me get each step right.

First, the width Γ
