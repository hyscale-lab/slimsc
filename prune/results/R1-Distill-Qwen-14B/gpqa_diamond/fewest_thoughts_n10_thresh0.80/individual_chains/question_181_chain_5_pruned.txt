Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, any neutrinos produced before that would still reach us, but anything after would not. But wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. 

So, I need to figure out the flux ratio between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stops. The options are various factors, like 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

Let me recall: the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The main source of the Sun's energy. The pp-III branch involves reactions where protons (H) combine with He-3 nuclei to produce He-4. This process releases a lot of energy and neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, that part of the chain would no longer produce neutrinos.

Wait, but the question says "hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped". So all other reactions remain. Hmm, does that mean the other branches of the pp chain (like pp-I and pp-II) are still active? Or was the entire pp chain affected? Because the pp chain has different branches, but I think pp-III is the dominant one, or at least a major contributor to neutrinos.

I remember that the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, mainly electron neutrinos. So if this branch stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would drop. But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands. So I need to think about the energy spectrum of neutrinos from the pp-III branch.

High-energy neutrinos (like the ones in the 800-900 keV band) are probably a significant product of the pp-III branch. If the pp-III stops, then the flux in higher energy bands would decrease more than in lower ones. But wait, what about the lower band, 700-800 keV? Are these neutrinos mostly from the pp-III branch or another process?

Wait, neutrinos from the Sun are primarily from the proton-proton chain. The pp-1 and pp-2 branches might produce lower-energy neutrinos. Or maybe the neutrinos have a certain energy distribution based on the reactions. Let me think: the pp-III branch involves the fusion of He-3 into He-4, which releases a lot of energy, and in the process, emits a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino would depend on the Q-value of the reaction.

The specific reaction I think is He-3 + p → He-4 + e+ + ν_e. The Q-value for this reaction determines the neutrino energy. Let me recall: the binding energy of He-4 is about 28 MeV. So the Q-value would be the energy released when two He-3 and two protons combine into He-4. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the individual reactions. The pp-III branch is He-3 + H → He-4 + e+ + ν_e.

The mass of He-3 is about 3 atomic mass units (but in terms of energy, each amu is about 931 MeV/c²). So He-3 has a mass of 3 * 931 ≈ 2793 MeV. A proton is about 938 MeV. So when they combine into He-4, which is 4 * 931 ≈ 3724 MeV.

So the reaction is He-3 + p → He-4 + e+ + ν_e.

The rest masses:
He-3: 3 * 931.5 ≈ 2794.5 MeV
p: 938.3 MeV
Total initial: 2794.5 + 938.3 ≈ 3732.8 MeV

He-4: 4 * 931.5 = 3726 MeV
e+: negligible? Because it's charged, but in the rest mass, the electron is about 0.511 MeV. But since it's emitted, we have to subtract its rest mass.

Wait, the Q-value is the difference in rest masses converted into energy. So:

Q = (mass of He-3 + mass of p) - (mass of He-4 + mass of e+)
So Q = (2794.5 + 938.3) - (3726 + 0.511) ≈ (3732.8) - (3726.511) ≈ 6.289 MeV.

So the Q-value is about 6.289 MeV, which is 6,289,000 eV or 6.289 MeV. So the neutrino gets a good chunk of that, maybe around a few MeV. Wait, but the neutrinos have energies up to around 14 MeV, but in reality, the average energy is lower. Oh, but wait, in reality, the neutrino energy from the pp-III branch is about a few MeV. So maybe 1-10 MeV.

Hmm, but the question is about neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands, which are much lower than the Q-value. So that's about 0.7-0.9 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. Wait, that's actually lower than the average neutrino energy from the pp-III branch. So why would the neutrinos in these ranges be affected by the pp-III stopping?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the energy bands. 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV, and 800-900 keV is 0.8-0.9 MeV. These are lower energies than the average neutrino energy from pp-III, which is higher, maybe around 4-5 MeV.

Wait, but then, if the pp-III branch stops, wouldn't that mainly affect the higher-energy neutrinos, leaving the lower-energy ones (like these bands) more or less unaffected? But that doesn't seem to fit with the question, because the question is about the ratio of these two bands, which are both low compared to the neutrino energies from pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the lower-energy neutrinos are mainly from other processes. Wait, the pp-I and pp-II branches—do they produce lower-energy neutrinos?

Wait, the pp-I and pp-II branches are part of the proton-proton chain, which also produces neutrinos. The pp-I branch is the initial step where two protons fuse into deuterium, and a positron and neutrino are emitted. The Q-value for that reaction is about 1.42 MeV, I think. So the neutrinos from pp-I would have lower energies, around 0.5 MeV on average, but they could also have a spectrum up to around a few MeV.

Wait, but in the Sun, the dominant source of neutrinos is the pp-III branch because it occurs in the core. The pp-I and pp-II are in the outer regions, I think. So the majority of the neutrinos come from the pp-III process.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the higher-energy neutrinos (like ~5 MeV) would suddenly stop, but the lower-energy ones from pp-I and pp-II would continue. But wait, the question is about the flux in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands.

So the pp-III branch would contribute to higher-energy neutrinos, but the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are lower than that. So maybe the pp-III doesn't contribute much to these lower bands. So if pp-III stopped, the flux in these lower bands wouldn't change much.

Wait, but if pp-III is the main source, perhaps the lower energy neutrinos are more from the pp-III as well. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos emitted in the pp-III process have a spectrum that extends down to lower energies. So if you stop the pp-III, the number of neutrinos at higher energies (like ~1 MeV and above) would drop, but the lower energies below that would still come from other processes. But wait, the bands in question are 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0
