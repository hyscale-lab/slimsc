Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the number of particles in energy states i and j, g are the statistical weights, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to the value of the Boltzmann constant k, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, interesting! So ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. That probably means that when the exponent becomes 1, because if ΔE = k*T, then (ΔE)/(kT) = T/(T) = 1, right?

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think the ratio n_i1 / n_j1 = 2, assuming that n_j is the lower energy state. Wait no, no, wait. Let me clarify: the ratio would be n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But if the energy levels are the same (same g?), and since the problem says the atoms are twice as excited in a specific level, perhaps the ratio of the excited level to the lower level is 2 in star_1, and maybe a different ratio in star_2.

Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's the same energy levels. So ΔE is the same for both.

Wait, the question says that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So, for both stars, the ΔE is same. Then, each star will have their own temperature, T
