Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let's see, the nucleus in question here is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, lithium has an atomic number of 3, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6. So the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is a Li-6 nucleus.

The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations here. Relativistic because the speed is a significant fraction of c, so non-relativistic formulas won't cut it.

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. The formula for gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So first, I'll calculate gamma. Let me write down the variables:

v = 0.96c
c is the speed of light, but since it's in terms of c, maybe it will cancel out.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784).

What's the square root of 0.0784? Let me think. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So Gamma is 1/0.28 which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait wait, 1 divided by 0.28. Let me do the division. 0.28 * 3.5 = 0.98, which is close to 1. So 3.5714 is correct. Let me calculate it more precisely. 0.28 * 3.5714 is about 0.28 *3.5=0.98, 0.28 *0.0714= ~0.02. So 0.98+0.02=1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest energy is mc². But wait, what's the mass of Li-6? I think the atomic mass unit (u) is involved here. 1 u is approximately 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. But energy in GeV, so maybe I can find the mass in terms of u, then convert to energy.

The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units because it has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons). Wait, but actually, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons due to binding energy, but for this purpose, I think the problem expects me to approximate it as 6 u, unless I'm given a specific value.

Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So that's Li-6. The exact mass can be found from the periodic table, but I'm not sure of the exact value. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should use the molar mass. The atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that
