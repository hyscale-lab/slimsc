Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining vertically onto this aperture, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Hmm.

Wait, the question says N is infinitely large. Oh right, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So this must be about a circular aperture. Because for a circle, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk with rings of maxima and minima.

But wait, the options don't have π involved, so maybe the approximation is used. The problem states that tan(theta) is approximately theta because the angles are small. That makes sense for the far field, where the diffraction minima are close together.

For a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles theta where the Bessel function J1 has its zeros. The first minima after the central maximum is at J1(k a sin theta) = 0. But wait, wait, the condition is J1(k a sin theta) = 0, where k is 2π/λ. The first zero of J1 is at about 3.8317, but wait, no, wait: the first zero is at 3.8317, but wait, no, wait, the first minima (after the central maximum) is at the first zero of J1. Wait, J1's first zero is at approximately 3.8317, but in the diffraction pattern, the first minimum is at that point. So the condition is (π a sin theta)/(lambda) ≈ 3.8317/2? Wait, no, let me think.

Wait, the formula for the minima in diffraction is given by a sin theta = (m * lambda) / (pi * a) * something... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the condition for the m-th minimum in a single-slit diffraction is given by a sin theta = m lambda, where a is the slit width. But wait, that's for a single slit, not a circular aperture. Oh, right, I'm mixing things up.

For a circular aperture, the single-slit formula doesn't apply. Instead, the minima occur when the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first minima in the diffraction pattern occurs at the first zero of J1, which is at theta = (lambda / (pi a)) * (approx 3.8317 / 2)? Wait, let me get this straight.

The formula for the angular position of the minima in a circular aperture is given by a sin theta = (x_m * lambda)/(2 pi), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So the first minima would be when x_m is the first zero of J1, which is approximately 3.8317. So a sin theta = (3.8317 * lambda)/(2 pi). Wait, no, maybe it's (x_m * lambda)/(2 pi a). Let me think.

Wait, no, the general formula is a sin theta = (x_m) * (lambda / (2 pi)), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So solving for theta, we get sin theta = (x_m lambda)/(
