Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually via a substitution or addition mechanism. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN is a source of CN-. So this might be a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would typically give a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. So the reaction between ketones and CN- (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst would form a cyanohydrin. That makes sense because the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile adding to the carbonyl, and then a proton is transferred to form the alcohol and nitrile group.

So the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure: the nitrile is at the end, and the hydroxy and methyl groups are on the same carbon. So that's (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is correct for a cyanohydrin.

So for the cyanohydrin formation, the reaction conditions usually involve an acid catalyst. Because the nucleophilic attack by CN- on the carbonyl would be more efficient if the carbonyl is activated. So the first reaction needs an acid, like H3O+ or perhaps another proton source.

Looking at the options, for reagent A, options A and B have H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3. Hmm, wait, what's the role of NaHSO3? I think that's a source of H+ and SO3^2- which is a weaker acid than H3O+ perhaps. Or maybe it's a milder acid? Alternatively, NaHSO3 can act as an acid catalyst, but sometimes it's used in certain conditions, maybe under specific pH or temperatures.

Wait, but in the cyanohydrin formation, it's usually done under acidic conditions. So the reagent A is probably H3O+ (proton source) because that's a strong acid that helps in the formation of the cyanohydrin. So looking at the options, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The cyanohydrin is formed via the acid-catalyzed addition of CN- (from
