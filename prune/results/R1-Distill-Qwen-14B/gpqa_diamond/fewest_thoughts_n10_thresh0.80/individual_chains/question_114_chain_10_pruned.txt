Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the appropriate reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options given are A to D, each providing A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (like NaCN), it's a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, usually when I think about this, the product would be a cyanohydrin. Oh right! A cyanohydrin forms when a carbonyl compound reacts with cyanide in a basic or acidic condition. So the reaction is: ketone + NaCN â†’ cyanohydrin.

So the first reaction must be the formation of a cyanohydrin. Now, what reagents are involved? NaCN is already present, so A would be the other component. I recall that sometimes, for the formation of cyanohydrins, you can use an acid catalyst. Like, adding H3O+ (which is option A and B) would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack easier.

Wait, but I've also heard that sometimes you can use something like NaHSO3 (option C and D). Oh wait, no, that's for maybe other reactions... Wait, no, NaHSO3 is often used in the sulfonation of aromatic rings or maybe as a source of HSO3^- which can act as an acid. Alternatively, maybe in other contexts like the hydrolysis of sulfonic esters. Hmm, but for the cyanohydrin formation, I think it's either an acid or a base.

Wait, in the cyanohydrin formation, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions because the CN- is a good nucleophile but the carbonyl is not very reactive. So adding H+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, which helps the CN- attack. So the reagent A should be acidic, like H3O+.

So looking at the options, A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. So that might narrow it down. Now, the first reaction would be butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ (so either A or B as the options). Then the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let's think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add to the carbonyl carbon, so the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group
