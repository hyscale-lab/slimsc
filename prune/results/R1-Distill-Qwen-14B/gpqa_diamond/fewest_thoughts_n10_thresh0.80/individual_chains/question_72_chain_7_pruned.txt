Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornene structureâ€”right, norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two rings. So the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group on the 7 position. I think that's the bridgehead position in norbornene.

Then, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. Hmm, sodium iodide is often a good nucleophile, especially in substitution reactions. The other compound has two dibromomethyl groups at the 5 and 6 positions of a cyclohexadiene. So that's like a cyclohexene ring with two substituents, each being a CH2Br2 or maybe BrCH2- groups. Wait, no, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each substituent is a CH2Br group. Because dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2? Wait, no, dibromomethyl would be a -CH2Br2 group? Wait, no, wait: dibromomethyl means each CH2 group has two bromines. Oh wait, no. Wait, the substituent is a dibromomethyl group, which is -CH2-Br2. But that's not possible because a CH2 group can't have two bromines attached. Oh wait, no, maybe it's -Br-CH2-Br? No, perhaps it's -CH2Br attached at each position. Wait, no, the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) with two bromines. So each substituent is Br2CH2-. But wait, that's impossible because a methyl group can only have three bonds. Maybe it's a BrCH2Br group. But that would require two bromines on a single carbon, which is possible but leads to a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted methyl group with two Br atoms, so each substituent is CH2Br2? Wait, that would be two Br atoms on the same CH2, which isn't possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. Oh wait, no, each substituent is a -CH2Br group. So each of the two substituents is a CH2Br group attached at positions 5 and 6 of the cyclohexadiene. So the cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br groups adjacent to each other.

Wait, no, 5 and 6 positions are adjacent, right? So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, I think. So positions 5 and 6 would be adjacent in the ring. So the substituents are at 5 and 6, each being a CH2Br group. So the structure is 5-CH2Br and 6-CH2Br, attached to the cyclohexene.

So the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's a norbornene derivative with a bulky tert-butoxy group.

Now, when this is treated with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide, what's happening here? Sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. The starting material has an ether group, but looking at the reaction conditions, perhaps it's an example of a nucleophilic substitution or perhaps some kind of coupling reaction.

Wait, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction. Because norbornene is a diene, and the cyclohexadiene might act as a dienophile. But wait
