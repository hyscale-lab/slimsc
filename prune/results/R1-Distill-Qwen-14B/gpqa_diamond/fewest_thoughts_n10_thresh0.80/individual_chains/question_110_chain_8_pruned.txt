Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star, as seen from Earth, is called apparent magnitude. The lower the number, the brighter the star. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait: the way it's phrased, "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, no, when they say 'brighter than X', that's higher magnitude numbers. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So, if a telescope can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17, that means it can see stars down to magnitude 17. So, stars with V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, meaning it can see stars down to 16 mag.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Magnitudes are a bit counterintuitive. The scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So the more negative the magnitude, the brighter the object. But in the question, the V
