Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of formation questions can get tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question is asking for the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks like a pretty complex molecule. I think it's some sort of polyene, maybe with multiple double bonds or something. Let me draw it out in my mind. Wait, the structure seems to have two double bonds. There's a (CH3)2C=CH- group, then another CH2, then a CH(CH3), then more CH2, then a CH=C(CH3)2. So two double bonds in the molecule.

They give the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its constituent atoms. So, for carbon, each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to become an atom.

They also provide bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Bond energies are the energies required to break the bond; so when you form a bond, you release energy, but if you're breaking, you use it.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, which is a hydrocarbon, the elements are carbon and hydrogen. So the formation would involve taking C atoms and H2 molecules, and forming this compound plus any other products (like any excess H2 or whatever).

I remember the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies. The general approach is to calculate the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants and subtract the energy released when the bonds in the products are formed. But wait, it's the reverse for enthalpy of formation. Because formation is making the compound from elements, so we have to consider the bonds formed and broken.

Wait, no. The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies as follows: the enthalpy of formation is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the products (the molecule).
