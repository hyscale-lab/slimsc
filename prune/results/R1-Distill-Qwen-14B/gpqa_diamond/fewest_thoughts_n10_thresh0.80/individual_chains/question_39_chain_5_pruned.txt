Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a' from the options provided.

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere has to be 100%.

Wait, but wait, the wave function given here is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. But when we're calculating probabilities, we take the modulus squared, which is the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.

So let me write the wave function as ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be [a / sqrt(1 + x)] + 0.5i. So when I multiply them, I get ψ*ψ = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25i²) + other terms. Wait, no, wait. Let me actually compute it.

Let me denote A = a / sqrt(1 + x), B = -0.5i. So ψ = A + B.

Then ψ*ψ would be (A + B)(A* - B), because the conjugate of B is -0.5(-i) = 0.5i. Wait, no, wait: B is -0.5i, so its complex conjugate is 0.5i. So ψ* is A + (-B), because (A + B)* = A* + B*. So ψ*ψ is (A + B)(A* - B), because B* is -0.5i* which is 0.5i
