Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. It says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I remember that the formation constant relates the concentration of the complex to the product of the ions. So the Ca-EDTA complex is formed when Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant, K, is given by K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh, right, because K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²-], is 0.02 M. We're supposed to find [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions.

Hmm, but wait, since EDTA is a chelating agent, it's a strong complexing agent. When K is very large, like 5e10, that means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free ions (both Ca²+ and EDTA^4-) should be really low.

But wait, what's the stoichiometry here? The problem says stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the complex is 1:1 between Ca and EDTA. So each mole of CaEDTA uses one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA is probably in different protonation states. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, which I think implies that EDTA is predominantly in the Y^4- form. So that's good; we can proceed without worrying about the different protonated forms.

So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA²-] as 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, the concentration
