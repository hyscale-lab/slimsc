Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see... The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, so Ca-EDTA must be one of those complexes. 

The given information is that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and they mention that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its proper deprotonated form to form the complex. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects much here. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Right, stability constants are about how much the complex forms, so a high K means it's very stable.

So, the problem is to find [Ca²+] in this solution. I think I need to use the stability constant expression. For a complex like Ca-EDTA, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The stability constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, wait. No, sometimes when I see K expressions, the complex is in the numerator. So K is the product of the concentrations of the ions in the denominator, right? Because when the complex dissociates, you get the ions.

So, K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+
