Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

The given data are: interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. So the crystal structure is a rhombohedron with a = 10 Angstrom, and angles of 30 degrees each.

Wait, interatomic distance... Oh wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance refers to the length of the edge of the unit cell. So a is 10 Angstroms here.

The question asks for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 cos^2 α + k^2 cos^2 β + l^2 cos^2 γ + ... hmm, wait, maybe I should think of the more general formula.

Wait, the general formula for d in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is a bit complicated. Oh right, in a cubic system, it's simpler, but for a rhombohedral (which is a special case of hexagonal?), maybe I should think of it as a more general case.

Wait, no. Rhombohedral is part of the cubic system when all edges are equal and angles are same. But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, which is not the typical 90 degrees of cubic systems. So it's a rhombohedral lattice with a = 10, and angles 30 degrees each.

The formula for interplanar distance in a general crystal is d(hkl) = (a^2 (b^2 c^2)/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + ... ))... Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to look up the formula.

Wait, I recall that for a rhombohedral system, where a = b = c =
