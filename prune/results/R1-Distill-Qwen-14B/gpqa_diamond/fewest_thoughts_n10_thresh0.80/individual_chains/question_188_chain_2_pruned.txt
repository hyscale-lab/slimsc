Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me recall what I know about crystals and interplanar distances.

Rhombohedral crystals have a structure where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms in the lattice. But in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell has parameters a, b, c, but since it's rhombohedral, a = b = c. So I think the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a, which is 10 Angstroms here.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance (d) is calculated using the formula derived from the Miller indices. The general formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)(cos α + cos β + cos γ) )/(3) ) Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with non-orthogonal axes is given by:

d_hkl = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k
