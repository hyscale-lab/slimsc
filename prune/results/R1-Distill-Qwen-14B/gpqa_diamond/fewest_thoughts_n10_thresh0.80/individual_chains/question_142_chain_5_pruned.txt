Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are all points in some space, probably the Bloch sphere or something related.

Let me think. The given density matrix ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that's interesting. I recall that the identity matrix scaled down by 1/2 would be a completely mixed state. Oh right, because the identity matrix represents the maximally mixed state, which for a single qubit is like being in a superposition of all possible states, but in a classical statistical mixture.

Wait, what's the Bloch sphere again? It's a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector is a vector from the origin to a point inside or on the sphere of radius 1. For a general single-qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (a, b, c), with a² + b² + c² ≤1.

So let's see. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that. The |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix [[1, 0],[0, 0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives the matrix [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. So ρ is (I)/2.

Comparing this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2, that would imply that r·σ = 0. Because (I + 0)/2 is I/2. So each component of the vector r must be zero. Because if you have r·σ = 0, then all the σ_i multiplied by their components (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) must sum to zero matrix. The only way for that is if each r_x, r_y, r_z is zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. Therefore, the geometrical position is at the origin. That would correspond to a completely mixed state, which makes sense because the density matrix is I/2.

Looking at the options:
A) (1,1,0) — that's a point on the Bloch sphere?
B) (0,0,1) — that's the |1⟩ state?
C) (0,0,0) — which is the completely mixed state.
D) (1,1,1) — that's outside the Bloch sphere.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle
