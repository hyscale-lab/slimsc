Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that spectrographs have different capabilities, specifically in terms of the brightness of the stars they can observe. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out the apparent magnitude of each star because the spectrographs have different brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So, a star must be apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait: the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Wait, wait, magnitude is a bit tricky. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is magnitude 17, that's fainter than 16. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 (so V <17) can be observed, and for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 (V <16) can be observed. So a star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO to detect it, and brighter than 16 for HIRES to detect it. So, any star that is brighter than 17 would be detectable by both, but if a star's magnitude is between 16 and 17, it's only detectable by HIRES, and if it's below 16, it's detectable by both. Wait, no, wait: because the brighter a star (lower mag), the more detectable. So, let me rephrase: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17, and HIRES can observe stars with V <16.

So, the star must be bright enough to be within both 17 and 16. Wait, but 16 is brighter than 17 (since lower is brighter). So if a star is V magnitude 15, both can detect it. If it's 16, HIRES can detect it but ESPRESSO can't, because 16 is less than 17? Wait, no: if the star's V is 16, for ESPRESSO, it's brighter than 17? No, 16 is less than 17, so it's brighter than 17 mag. So ESPRESSO can observe it. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude of the star is the key. For example, if a star is magnitude 15, that's much brighter than both 16 and 17, so both can observe it. But if a star is at magnitude 16.5, then it's fainter than 16, so HIRES can't observe it, but it's brighter than 17? No, 16.5 is fainter than 17. Wait, no, 16.5 is brighter than 17. Because lower numbers are brighter. So the magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive.

Wait, the
