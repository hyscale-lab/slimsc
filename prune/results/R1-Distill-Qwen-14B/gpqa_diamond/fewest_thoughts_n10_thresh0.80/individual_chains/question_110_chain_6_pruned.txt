Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is at Paranal Observatory and HIRES is at Keck. Both are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, while HIRES goes up to 16. So a star must be bright enough (apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16) to be seen by HIRES and also less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait: because, if HIRES can only see stars brighter than 16, then stars with V mag ≤16 can be seen by HIRES, but ESPRESSO can take stars up to 17. So any star that's in the range of V mag <=16 can be seen by both, because ESPRESSO can handle up to 17. So the limiting factor is the brighter limit, which is 16 for HIRES. Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the question states that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means apparent V mag <=17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag <=16.

So a star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be observed by both, because HIRES can't see fainter than 16. Because, HIRES's limit is 16, so if a star is 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. So the star needs to have apparent V mag ≤16 to be visible by both.

Now looking at the options, I have to check each star's apparent V magnitude. Let's look at each star:

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent mag is V = absolute mag + distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10) = 5*(1) =5. So V =15.5 +5 =20.5. Oh wait, that's way above both
