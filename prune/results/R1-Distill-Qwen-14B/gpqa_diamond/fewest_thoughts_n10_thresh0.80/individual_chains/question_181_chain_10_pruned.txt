Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Okay, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. 

So, the scenario is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, but all other reactions are still going on as usual. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The question is asking for flux(band1) divided by flux(band2), so F1/F2.

Hmm, first, I remember that the pp-III branch is one of the proton-proton chains in the Sun. The pp I, II, and III branches are different stages of hydrogen fusion into helium. The pp-III branch specifically produces high-energy neutrinos, right? So if that stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop, but what about the others?

Wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So, reactions in the pp-I and pp-II branches are still happening. Also, the CNO cycle, which is another hydrogen fusion process, is unaffected.

Okay, but how do these different processes contribute to neutrino flux? Solar neutrinos come from various sources. The main ones are the proton-proton chains and the CNO cycle. The pp-III branch is a part of the pp chain, and I think it's responsible for producing the highest-energy neutrinos because it involves more energetic steps—like the 7 Be neutrinos, right?

Wait, neutrinos are produced at different energies depending on the reaction. The pp-I and pp-II probably produce lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-III branch is where the 7Be captures a proton to become 8B, emitting a neutrino. Those neutrinos have higher energies, around a few MeV, I think. Oh wait, but the bands are in the hundreds of keV, so maybe they're lower than that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should recall the neutrino energy distributions. The dominant solar neutrino flux comes from the pp chain—specifically, the pp-III branch produces the 8B neutrinos, which have energies up to about 14.5 MeV. But wait, the question's bands are 700-800 keV (0.7-
