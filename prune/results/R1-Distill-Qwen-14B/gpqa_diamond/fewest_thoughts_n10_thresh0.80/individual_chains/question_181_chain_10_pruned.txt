Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the core reactions stopped, we wouldn't notice the change in light immediately. But neutrinos, which can escape much more easily, would be affected. But this question is about the flux of neutrinos reaching Earth in two specific energy bands.

The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which is the primary source of the Sun's energy. The pp chains have different branches. I remember that the pp-I branch produces a certain amount of neutrinos, and pp-III is another part. Oh wait, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where two protons fuse to form deuterium and emit a positron and a neutrino. Or was that part of pp-I? Hmm, maybe I should think about the neutrino production.

Solar neutrinos are mainly produced in two processes: the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces more neutrinos, I think. The main neutrino emission from the pp chain comes from the beta plus decay in the pp-I branch. The pp-III branch is a minor part of the chain and produces fewer neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stopped, what would happen to the neutrino flux? Well, the pp-III branch contributes a certain amount of neutrinos, but if it's suddenly stopped, the production of those neutrinos would drop. But wait, the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So only the pp-III branch is stopped, others continue. So other branches of the pp chain, like pp-I, are still active.

Neutrinos have different energies based on their production processes. The higher-energy neutrinos come from certain reactions. For example, the pep reaction (another branch) produces higher-energy neutrinos. But in this case, the pp-III is the one stopping. Let me think about the energies involved.

The energy bands given are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I
