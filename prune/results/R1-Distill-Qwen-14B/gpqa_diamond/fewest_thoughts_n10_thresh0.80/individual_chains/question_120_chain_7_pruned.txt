Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I think that means their density is the same throughout space, right? So like, if you look in any direction, stars aren't clumped together more densely in some areas than others. Uniform distribution implies that the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait a second. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is closer than one with 0.5 parsecs. Oh wait no, wait. I think it's the other way around. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax (in arcseconds). So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If the parallax is 0.5, the distance is 2 parsecs. So as parallax increases, distance decreases.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So for a given range of plx (like from plx to plx + d), how does the number of stars N in that range depend on plx?

Wait, let me think about the distribution. Since
