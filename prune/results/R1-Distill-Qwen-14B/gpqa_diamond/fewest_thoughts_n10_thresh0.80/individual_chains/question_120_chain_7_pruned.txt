Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is distance d (in parsecs) equals 1 over parallax (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx. Right, that's the basic formula.

Now the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, probably in space, meaning the number of stars is uniform in space density. So, the number density of stars is constant. But how does that translate to the number per unit range of parallax?

Wait, so we're looking for how the number of stars per unit change in parallax (like, per plx unit) changes with plx. So, maybe we need to think about the volume of space that corresponds to a certain range of parallaxes.

Let me think. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars. So if I have a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what distance does that correspond to?

But wait, the question is about the number of stars in a range of plx. So maybe I should consider the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd, which corresponds to plx and plx + dplx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume. So the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of that shell.

The shell's volume is the surface area of a sphere multiplied by the thickness. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd². The thickness in distance is dd. So the volume is 4πd² dd.

But wait, we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dd in terms of dplx. Let's see. d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since d decreases as plx increases, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But for the purpose of counting stars, the magnitude matters, so I can take the absolute value.

So, substituting d =1/plx into the volume: 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx²)) dplx. Wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait, the volume is 4πd² dd. So that's 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx²) dplx) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The volume element is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx). The negative sign just indicates direction, so for the number of stars, we'll take the positive value. So the volume element in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that's 4π (1/plx^4) ) dplx.

Wait, no, wait. Let's do the substitution step by step.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, the volume element 4π d² dd becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 dplx) ) → 4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx). Ignoring the negative sign, the volume element is proportional to 1/plx^4 dplx. So, the number of stars in a bin of dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per volume). Since n is constant, N is proportional
