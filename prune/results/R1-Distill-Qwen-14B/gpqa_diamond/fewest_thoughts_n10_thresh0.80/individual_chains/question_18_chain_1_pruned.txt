Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me some data. Both stars have certain masses relative to the Sun, but I'm not sure if those masses matter for this particular question. The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is just extra info or perhaps it's a distractor. I'll focus on the abundance numbers instead.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1. And [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. I'm a bit rusty on what these brackets mean.

Wait, the notation [X/Y] in astronomy stands for the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y compared to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, sometimes it's defined as log(n_X/n_Y) minus log of solar ratio. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

Given that, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So if that difference is 0, the star has the same Fe/H as the Sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So Mg/H is the same as in the Sun.

Now, the photospheric composition of the Sun is given. For the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, isn't that a bit confusing? Let me think.

Wait, the general formula is 12 + log(n_X / H) = something. So for the Sun, log(n_X / H) = (something) -12. Because 12 + log(...) equals that number.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait, I think the standard notation is [X/H]
