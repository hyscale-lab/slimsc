Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay pretty quickly. But wait, I need to figure out the mean decay distance given the production energy, mass, and width.

Wait, the question gives me E_X as 8 GeV, m_X as 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X as 320 MeV. Oh right, Γ is the decay width. I think the mean lifetime is related to the width somehow. Oh yeah, the uncertainty principle! The lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width. So τ is roughly ħ divided by Γ. Or wait, maybe it's Γ multiplied by something else. No, I think the relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). 

Wait, but wait, the decay width Γ is the total decay rate, which has units of energy. So to get time, τ, I need to multiply by Planck's constant over 2π or something? Because ħ has units of energy times time. So let's think: Γ is in GeV, and ħ is in GeV·s, right? So τ should be ħ divided by Γ. 

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me get this straight. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the equation Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think
