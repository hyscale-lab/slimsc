Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And they can decay into other particles. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X. 

The given information is:
- Production energy E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width Γ_X = 320 MeV

And the options are four different distances in meters. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but I might have to correct for relativistic effects because particles like mesons are moving at speeds close to the speed of light.

So the mean decay distance (L) should be L = c * τ, where c is the speed of light. But wait, how do I find τ from the given parameters?

I recall that the width Γ is related to the lifetime through the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, units are important here. Let's make sure I get the units right. Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert that into energy units that match with ħ.

Wait, ħ has units of GeV·s. Because ħc is a common unit in particle physics. Let me think: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yeah, I remember that number. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging the numbers, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's a really short lifetime. But mesons can have short lifetimes, especially if their width is large. A larger width implies a shorter lifetime because Γ is inversely proportional to τ.

Now, once I have τ, I can find the mean decay distance L = c * τ. But wait, I should also consider the particle's velocity. Because if the particle is moving relativistically, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation.

Wait, no, I think the formula I used for τ is already the proper lifetime, but when considering the decay length, we have to multiply by the velocity of the particle. So actually, the mean decay distance is L = γ * v * τ * c. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms here.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the particle's velocity. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is
