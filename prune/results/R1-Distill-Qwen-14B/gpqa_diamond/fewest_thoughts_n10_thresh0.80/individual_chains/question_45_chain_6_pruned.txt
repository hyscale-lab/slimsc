Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given in terms of E, where E is pi squared h-bar squared over 2mL squared. Right, I remember that for a single particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²)E, where E is the base unit as given here.

But wait, these are four particles, and they're identical spin-1/2 fermions. Oh right, because of the Pauli exclusion principle, each quantum state can be occupied by at most one fermion. So the particles must be in different quantum states.

Each particle has spin 1/2, so each can be either up or down. Wait, but in a one-dimensional well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. So each n can be paired with two spins, meaning each n can accommodate two particles. 

So for four particles, how do they fill up the states? Let's think about the ground state first. Ground state means the lowest energy configuration. Each energy level can hold two particles (because of spin up and down). 

The lowest energy state is n=1. Since each n can have two particles, n=1 can hold two. Then n=2 can hold two as well. So the first four particles would have n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). But wait, wait. No, wait, because four particles would require two levels. Because n=1 can take two, n=2 can take two more. So all four can be filled up to n=2.

Wait, no, that can’t be right. Let me think again. For four particles, each with spin up and down, the first two go into n=1, spins up and down. The next two go into n=2, spins up and down. So yes, in the ground state, all four are filled up to n=2. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's
