Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So that direction can be described using spherical coordinates, but since it's in x-z, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, right? So any direction in the x-z plane would have θ varying, but the azimuthal angle φ would be 0 or maybe π, depending on direction. Wait, but the question says it's an arbitrary direction, so maybe the eigenvector would depend on θ and φ. Or maybe the problem is expecting an expression in terms of θ and φ.

Wait, actually, the question is about the eigenvector of P along n. Oh, right, the operator is given as components P_x, P_y, P_z, each multiplied by ħ/2, so the total operator P would be the vector sum P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. But wait, no, the operator is along n, so it's actually the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So the operator is P · n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The operator given is P, which has components P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator along direction n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So, P_n = P · n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But wait, the problem says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n". So the operator is P along n, which would be P · n. So the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.
