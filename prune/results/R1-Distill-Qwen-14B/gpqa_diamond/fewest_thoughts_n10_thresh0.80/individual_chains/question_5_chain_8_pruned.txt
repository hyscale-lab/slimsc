Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along a certain direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often related to angular momentum. Oh right, the Pauli matrices represent spin operators. So, maybe P is the spin operator for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. 

The problem gives me the components of the operator P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write those down:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Right, these look like the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

The operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n must have components (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane. Since it's a direction vector, nx² + nz² = 1. 

The operator P is the vector sum of its components: P = nx P_x + nz P_z + ny P_y. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P simplifies to nx P_x + nz P_z.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is along the direction n, so I think P is proportional to the vector operator in that direction. So the overall operator is proportional to (nx σx + nz σz ), where σx and σz are the Pauli matrices. 

But since the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P. 

Let me define the operator more precisely. The operator P is given by:

P = (nx P_x + nz P_z)
= (ħ/2) (nx σx + nz σz )

So, the matrix form of the operator is (ħ/2) times [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ].

Wait, let me double-check that. Because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you multiply each by nx and nz respectively and add, you get:

nx σx: [[0, nx], [nx, 0]]
nz σz: [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]]
Adding them gives [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

So the operator matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by that.

So the matrix for P is:
(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx],
           [nx, -nz] ]

We need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Which is:
