Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is the x-axis direction. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. We know that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. 

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a' from the given options. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. So I think I need to find the normalization constant 'a' such that the wave function is normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, wait a minute. Wave functions are usually complex, right? So the wave function ψ(x) can be written as a real part plus an imaginary part. But when calculating probabilities, we take the absolute square, which is ψ*(x) * ψ(x), where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Therefore, the complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. 

So when we multiply ψ and ψ*, the imaginary parts will cancel out. Let me compute that:

ψ*(x) * ψ(x) = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because the cross terms (the ones with imaginary units) will be zero when multiplied. Because (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (a/sqrt(1+x)) is real, and then the terms involving i will be (a/sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5
