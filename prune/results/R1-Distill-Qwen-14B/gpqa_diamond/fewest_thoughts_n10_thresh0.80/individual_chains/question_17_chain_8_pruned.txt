Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand like EDTA, the concentration of the free metal ions can be found using the dissociation constant, K. 

Wait, EDTA is a chelating agent. So the Ca-EDTA complex would dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, the formula for the complex is probably CaY²-, where Y is EDTA. Because EDTA is usually in the form Y^4- when it's deprotonated enough.

So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant Kf is given, but wait, the question says K_Ca-EDTA is 5e10. I think Kf is the formation constant, which is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So yes, Kf = 5e10.

But wait, in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. We're to find [Ca²+], assuming that the solution is at ideal pH, which probably means that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the concentration of EDTA^4- is approximately equal to the concentration of the complex that dissociates.

Wait, but wait. The problem states it's the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration is 0.02 M, which is the concentration of the complex, [CaY²−] = 0.02 M.

But when this complex dissociates, it can release Ca²+ and EDTA^4− as per the equation:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²− 

Wait, maybe I should write it the other way. The formation of the complex is Ca²+ + EDTA^4− → CaEDTA²−. So the reverse reaction is the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

So the dissociation constant Kd (dissociation) would be 1/Kf, because Kf is the formation constant. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But let me think again. The formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So the dissociation would be Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−] = 1/Kf = 2e-11.

So, the initial state is that the complex is 0.02 M. Let’s assume that '
