Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its active form, ready to complex with metals. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation here. The given K value is 5x10^10. I think K here refers to the stability constant for the Ca-EDTA complex.

Wait, what's the stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (K) is a measure of the tendency of a complex to form. A higher K means the complex is more stable. So if K is big, the complex doesn't dissociate much, meaning the concentration of free calcium ions would be low.

So, the problem is asking for [Ca²+]. Let me think about how to approach this. Since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, that's the concentration of the complex. Let me denote the complex as CaY²−, where Y is EDTA. So the initial concentration [CaY²−] is 0.02 M.

Now, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and Y^4−. The dissociation reaction is:

CaY²− ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The stability constant K is given by K = [Ca²+][Y^4−] / [CaY²−]

Wait, but K is a very large number, so the denominator [CaY²−] is going to be much larger than the numerator. Wait no, wait – because if K is large, the products (Ca²+ and Y^4−) are favored, meaning that the complex doesn't dissociate much. So, the concentration of the complex [CaY²−] would be approximately equal to the initial concentration, 0.02 M, minus a tiny amount x. But since K is so big, x will be very small, so we can approximate [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is forming the complex. So when the complex dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA. So, at equilibrium, the concentration of Ca²+ is x, Y^4− is x, and the complex is 0.02 - x. But since K is so big, x is going to be really small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, substituting into the K equation: K = (x)(x) / (0.02) ≈ x² / 0.02.

Given K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = x² / 0.02

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9

So x² = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) → x = 3.16e4? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1e9 is 10^9. The square root of 10^9 is 10^(9/2) = 10^4.5 which is 31622.776... approximately 3.16e4. But wait, that can't be right because 3e4 is way larger than 0.02 M. That doesn't make sense because if x is 3e4, then 0.02 - x would be negative, which is impossible.

Oh! I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation. Maybe I got the K expression wrong. Let me think again. Wait, no. The K expression is correct for the dissociation.

Wait, maybe the K given is actually the formation constant. Wait, the formation constant K
