Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So, the question is about the observations of a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. The question is about the comoving distance of this quasar based on the Lambda-CDM model parameters given.

Wait, wait. I remember that when we observe an object's spectrum, certain features can tell us about its redshift. Like, if a spectral line is shifted to a longer wavelength, that indicates the object is moving away from us, right? Redshift. So the peak at 790 nm must be a redshifted emission line. But what line is that?

Oh right, the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, around 121 nm. Hydrogen's Lyman series. But wait, if the observed wavelength is longer than 790 nm, which is near infrared, that would mean a lot of redshift. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. So the rest wavelength would be shorter, like 121 nm. Let me calculate the redshift.

Redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So for Lyman alpha, rest is 121.6 nm. Observed is 790 nm. So z = (790 / 121.6) -1. Let me compute that. 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.498. So z is about 5.498. So roughly z ≈ 5.5.

So the quasar is at a redshift of about z=5.5. Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is the distance that would be measured by a hypothetical observer at the same time (a=1) but in a comoving frame. To find D_C, I need to integrate the inverse of the Hubble parameter from a=1/a_0 down to a=1/(1+z). Wait, no, wait. The comoving distance formula is D_C = c ∫ (1/a) da / H(a) from a=1/(1+z) to a=1. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, another approach: for a flat
