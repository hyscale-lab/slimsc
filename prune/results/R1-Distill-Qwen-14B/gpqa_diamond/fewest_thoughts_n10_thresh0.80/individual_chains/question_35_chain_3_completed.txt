Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. The setup says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix and that it's given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form: the first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0).

Wait, so the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh, I remember that this looks a lot like the Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is i times this, maybe? Let me think. The Pauli matrices σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]? Or wait, no, maybe σ_y is different. Wait, the standard Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. I think σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is actually the same as σ_y. Oh, but in this problem, S is given as that matrix, so maybe that's how it's defined.

But wait, the operator A_y is c times S. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. But since S is a 2x2 matrix, which is like the Pauli matrix, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me remember that the spin matrices for spin-½ particles have eigenvalues ±½ for each component.

But wait, the S matrix here is given, and it's a 2x2 matrix. So the eigenvalues of S would determine the eigenvalues of A_y.

But let's get back to the problem. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The options give some statements about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which for a muon (which is a lepton, spin-½ particle) would have components proportional to the Pauli matrices. The standard spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So for S being σ_y, the operator A would be something like (ħ/2) σ_y for spin, but in this problem, A_y is given as c*S, where c is h/(4π).

Let me calculate the matrix for A_y. So c is h/(4π). So A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute that matrix:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
= [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
   [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

So that's our operator matrix. Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0. 

The matrix A_y - λ I is:

[ [-λ, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant of this is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ (i*(-i))(h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, i*(-i) is equal to 1, right? Because i * (-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) * 1 = 0.

So the equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. Solving for λ, we get λ = ± h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So any option that mentions the eigenvalues having imaginary parts can be ruled out.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or ± something else. Wait, but our eigenvalues are real, so option A is incorrect because it mentions imaginary parts. So A is out.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't fit. Because our eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So B is also incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think. The square of the angular momentum operator A² would be (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²). For a spin-½ particle, the square of the total angular momentum (A_total) is ħ² s(s+1), where s=½. So A² would have eigenvalues ( (½)(½+1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². Wait, but here, A_y is just one component. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, what about A²?

Well, in quantum mechanics, if a state is an eigenstate of one component of angular momentum (like A_y), it's not an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared unless it's a state that's an eigenstate of the total angular momentum. But wait, for spin systems, if you have an eigenstate of a component, it's not an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared. Because the total angular momentum squared commutes with each component, so eigenstates of any component are eigenstates of the total.

Wait, but that's not right. The operators A² and A_y commute because [A², A_y] = 0. So any eigenstate of A_y must also be an eigenstate of A². Therefore, the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A². So in option C, the statement says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, so maybe the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of Az. Because if they were, then they would have to be eigenstates of all three components, which only occurs for the zero state, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but for spin-½ particles, the eigenstates of A_y are linear combinations of the eigenstates of A_z. For example, the eigenstates of A_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are combinations of |+z> and |-z>. So these are not eigenstates of A_z. Therefore, option C's statement would be correct if it says that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So C says that, so C could be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A²? Since A² commutes with A_y, yes. So they would share eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since A_y and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So yes, the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure what that means. Basis functions of the matrix? I think the term might be a bit unclear. But I think the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, but any matrix can be diagonalized in its own eigenbasis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the statements is correct during the calculation. So which of the options is correct.

Wait, let me re-examine each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. As discussed, this seems correct because A² and Ay commute, so they share eigenfunctions, but Az doesn't commute, so they don't.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions of the matrix? I think this might be a way of saying that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, which they do. But more accurately, the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis for the space if the matrix is diagonalizable. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the problem is a multiple-choice question, so only one option can be correct. Let me look at the options again.

Let me think about what each option is saying.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not entirely sure what "basis functions of the matrix operator" means. Perhaps it's referring to the fact that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space in which Ay acts. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors (which are two orthonormal vectors) form a basis for C², so D's statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct. Wait, but the options may not both be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's go back. Looking for which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay:

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same. So the statement is correct. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. The matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis, so D's statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct. But perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement will you consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps all the options are not mutually exclusive. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az.

Yes, that's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But they are not eigenstates of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So this is correct. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the options are presented as possible correct statements, and the question is which one you would consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but the problem is about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So let's look back at the options.

Option C's statement is about the eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Which is correct.

Option D's statement is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the matrix. Also correct.

But in the problem, the options are independent, and only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the basis functions of Ay. I think that's correct because the matrix Ay is being represented in the standard basis, but its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So the statement in D is correct.

So now, I'm a bit stuck because both C and D seem correct. But the options are probably designed so that only one is correct.

Wait, another approach: let's evaluate each option.

Option A: The eigenvalues are complex, which they aren't. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Also states eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which they don't. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: Correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So, both C and D are correct? But the options can't both be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine what the problem says about the operator Ay.

Wait, the operator Ay is given by c * S, where S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the spin operator matrix. So for a spin-½ particle, S would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Wait, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of S (since S is the same as σ_y) would be ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. So perhaps the eigenvalues of S are ± ħ/2, so the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c * S, would be c*(± ħ/2).

But wait, c is given as h/(4 π). So substituting, Ay's eigenvalues would be [h/(4π)] * (± ħ/2 ). Wait, but ħ is h/(2π). So let's compute that.

h/(4π) * (h/(2π)) ) = [h^2 ] / (8 π² ), but wait, no. Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, S has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2), because for spin-½, each component has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So A_y is c * S, so eigenvalues are c * (± ħ/2 ). Substituting c = h/(4π), we get:

λ = (h/(4π)) * ( ± ħ/2 )

But ħ = h/(2π), so substituting, λ becomes:

= (h/(4π)) * ( ± (h/(2π)) / 2 )

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, S is the matrix, and when multiplied by c, which is h/(4 π), the eigenvalues are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

Wait, the eigenvalues of S, as a Pauli matrix, are ±1. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply by a scalar c, the eigenvalues become ±c.

Wait, but wait, no. Because in the problem statement, S is the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y. So the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay = c * S are c * (±1 ) = ±c. So since c = h/(4 π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π).

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4 π), which are real. So the eigenvalues are real, as I thought before.

So option A is incorrect because it talks about the imaginary parts being ±2πh or similar, which is not the case.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part says they're not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2 and has two eigenvalues, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Hmm. So both options C and D seem correct, but only one can be the correct answer. But perhaps D is incorrect in the way it's phrased. Let me read D again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, perhaps the statement is not correct because the matrix operator Ay is expressed in the standard basis, and its eigenfunctions form a different basis. So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the space, but not necessarily the basis in which the operator is expressed. So the statement in D is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, the statement may be correct because any set of eigenvectors can form a basis. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the problem is, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So let me think about each option again:

- A: Incorrect, eigenvalues are real.

- B: Incorrect, eigenvalues are real.

- C: Correct, because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

- D: Correct, because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space.

So both C and D seem correct. But perhaps only one is an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let's think about the eigenfunctions.

The eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenvectors of the matrix A_y. For a spin-½ system, the eigenstates of Ay are the |+y> and |-y> states. These are superpositions of the |+z> and |-z> states. So, for example, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and similar for |-y>.

Now, the matrix representation of A_y is in the standard basis (which is the |+z> and |-z> basis). So in this basis, the eigenvectors of A_y are not the same as the basis vectors. Instead, they are superpositions. So the eigenfunctions φ are linear combinations of the standard basis vectors. So, perhaps option D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions φ are not the same as the basis functions of the matrix operator. Or wait, the basis functions of the matrix operator would be the standard basis, perhaps. Alternatively, the eigenfunctions form their own basis.

Hmm, perhaps the statement in D is correct because any set of eigenvectors forms a basis. But the standard basis is different from the eigenbasis. So I'm not sure about D.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, which is true. So D's statement is correct.

But in the context of the problem, perhaps option C is the correct statement.

Alternatively, let me look for another approach. Let's compute the eigenvectors and see what their form is. Let's compute the eigenvectors for Ay.

Ay's matrix is [[0, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]], with eigenvalues λ = ± h/(4π).

For λ = h/(4π), the equation is (Ay - λ I) v = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ -h/(4π),  -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -h/(4π) ] ]

The equations are:

- (h/(4π)) v1 - i (h/(4π)) v2 = 0 → -v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( -i, 1 ). So for example, v = (-i, 1) is an eigenvector for λ = h/(4π).

Similarly, for λ = -h/(4π), the equations would lead to v1 = i v2. So the eigenvector is (i, 1).

So the eigenfunctions are (-i, 1) and (i, 1). These are the same as the |+y> and |-y> states, which are superpositions of the |+z> and |-z> states.

So these eigenvectors are not the same as the standard basis vectors (which are |+z> and |-z>). So the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis vectors but are combinations of them. Therefore, perhaps option D's statement is not correct because the matrix's basis is the standard basis, not the eigenbasis. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting D.

Alternatively, the eigenfunctions are a basis for the matrix operator's space. So perhaps D's statement is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should think about which options are correct.

The correct statements would be:

- The eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² (C is correct so far).

- They are not eigenfunctions of Az (so C's statement is correct).

- The eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

So both C and D could be correct. But perhaps the options have only one correct answer.

Wait, let's check the problem statement again. The options are A to D, and only one is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the operator Ay is represented by the matrix given. So when you diagonalize Ay, you find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions (eigenfunctions) of the operator. So perhaps D is correct in stating that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. 

Alternatively, the matrix operator is expressed in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors form a different basis. So D's statement would imply that the eigenfunctions are the basis in which the matrix is diagonal, which is correct. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix. So D's statement is correct.

But earlier, I thought option C is correct. So maybe both C and D are correct, but the options are presented as four choices, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps only option D is correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options. Let's read them again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. 

We know that A^2 commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A^2. So the first part is correct. The second part about Az is correct because Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. 

This is a bit ambiguous. The matrix operator is expressed in a certain basis, but the eigenfunctions might form a different basis. So the statement may be correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis, but perhaps they are not the basis in which the operator is expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because the matrix operator's eigenbasis is the set of eigenfunctions.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

We have eigenvalues ± h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are out. So the correct statements are between C and D.

Option C is about A² and Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same. So C is correct.

So the correct answer should be C and D. But since there's only one correct option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So C is correct.

So the answer is C.


The problem involves analyzing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting complex eigenvalues (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

2. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the total angular momentum operator) but not of the Z-component \( A_z \).
   - \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning their eigenfunctions are the same. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). This makes the statement in option C correct.

3. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the \( 2 \)-dimensional space. However, the phrase "basis functions of the matrix operator" could imply that the eigenfunctions are the same as the standard basis in which \( A_y \) is represented. This is not the case, as the eigenfunctions are linear combinations of the standard basis vectors. Thus, option D is ambiguous and likely incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). Option D is incorrect due to the ambiguity in its phrasing and the fact that the eigenfunctions do not coincide with the standard basis.

**Answer: C**
