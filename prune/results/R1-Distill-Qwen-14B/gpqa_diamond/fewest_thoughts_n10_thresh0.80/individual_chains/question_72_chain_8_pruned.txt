Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product. Hmm, let's see. The question gives a series of reactions, and I need to track each step to determine the structure of product 4. 

Starting with the first part: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Oh right, I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. The bicyclo compound is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. Wait, but in the Diels-Alder, the dienophile is the electron-deficient molecule. Let me think, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene—since there are two dibromomethyl groups, maybe they are electron-withdrawing, making the dienophile more reactive.

So, each equivalent of the dienophile would react with the diene. Since there are two equivalents, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur. Wait, but the initial starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is a norbornene structure. It's a conjugated diene. So, when it reacts with the dienophile, which is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring with two substituents. But wait, since there are two equivalents, maybe two cyclohexadiene molecules react with the norbornene?

Wait, no, norbornene is a bicyclic molecule with two double bonds. No, wait, no—it's bicyclo[2.2.1], which has one double bond. The structure is a bridged bicyclic system with one double bond. So, the norbornene diene would react once with each dienophile. Wait, but if there are two equivalents of the dienophile, maybe two Diels-Alder adducts form. Hmm.

Wait, but norbornene has only one double bond, so it can only undergo one Diels-Alder reaction. So perhaps each dienophile molecule reacts with the same norbornene, but where? Or maybe each dienophile has two possible sites for addition? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a Diels-Alder but a different cycloaddition. Or perhaps the dienophile is adding to the norbornene in a way that gives two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is the diene, and the dienophile is the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups. So, when they react, the Diels-Alder would form a bicyclic structure with substituents at the 5 and 6 positions (since the starting dienophile is 5,6-bis...), but wait, the dienophile has two dibromomethyl groups at 5 and 6 positions of the cyclohex
