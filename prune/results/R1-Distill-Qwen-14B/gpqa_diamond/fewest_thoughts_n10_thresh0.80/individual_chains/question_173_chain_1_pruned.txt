Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get what's being asked.

The question is about an electron moving at a speed v = 2 * 10^8 m/s along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its location, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, of the electron. The options are A to D, with different powers of ten in joules.

Hmm, right. I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. That's the one where you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π, but often approximated as just h-bar. So, the formula is Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes people just use ħ for order of magnitude estimates. 

Wait, but for the minimum uncertainty, I think the formula is Δx * Δp = ħ/2, but maybe in this problem, they're just using Δx * Δp ≈ ħ for simplicity. Either way, the exact factor might not matter since the question is about estimating the order of magnitude.

So, I need to relate the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy. Because the question is about energy, not momentum. Oh right, the energy of a particle is related to its momentum via the equation E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. 

But wait, since we have an uncertainty in momentum, Δp, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the derivative of E with respect to p, right? So, using the uncertainty principle for energy and momentum. Oh, wait, no, maybe a better approach is to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, but wait, no, the question is about energy uncertainty due to position uncertainty. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach it this way: the uncertainty in energy comes from the uncertainty in momentum since energy depends on momentum. So, first, find Δp using Δx, then find ΔE based on Δp.

Let me outline the steps:
