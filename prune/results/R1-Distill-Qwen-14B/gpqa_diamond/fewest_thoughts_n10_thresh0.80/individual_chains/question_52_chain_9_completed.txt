Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a star whose surface is partially covered by dark spots. The star has some given parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(kT)). Here, g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the levels, and E2 and E1 are their energies.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So when the star is without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be higher without spots.

But why does the presence of spots affect this ratio? Well, the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots cover part of the surface, the overall observed Teff drops. But the photosphere is the layer we're considering, so each region (spot or not) has its own temperature. However, the question states that the photosphere is in LTE, so maybe the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is what's changing.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's photosphere is in LTE, but when spots are present, the overall observed Teff is a combination of the hotter and cooler regions. But when the problem talks about the photosphere, perhaps each part (with or without spots) is in LTE, and the overall effect gives the star's overall Teff as 5500 K. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the entire photosphere is treated as if it's at 5500 K when spots are present, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. But the photosphere itself is in LTE. So maybe each region (spot and unspotted) is in LTE, but the overall observed flux is a combination of the two regions.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So perhaps the photosphere's temperature is what's affecting this ratio. But the overall Teff of the star is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. Hmm, but the problem says the photosphere is in LTE. So maybe each part of the photosphere—spotted and unspotted—is in LTE, but the question is about the entire photosphere's average.

Wait, no, the question says "the stellar photosphere is in LTE." So the photosphere as a whole is at a certain temperature. But when spots are present, perhaps the effective temperature is measured as an average, but the photosphere itself is not at a uniform temperature. Oh, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps when the star has no spots, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, each part (the 60% unspotted and 40% spotted) is at their own temperatures. But the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but Teff is an observed parameter that depends on the total emitted flux.

Wait, maybe I need to model this as a two-component blackbody. The flux from the star without spots is all at 6000 K. When spots are present, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature, say T_spot. The observed Teff is 5500 K. So we can calculate T_spot.

Wait, but the problem tells us that when spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the effective temperature is the average based on the area. But wait, the effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity and the radius. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR² σ Teff^4. So when spots are present, the star emits less total luminosity because part of the surface is cooler. So the Teff would be lower.

But the problem says that when the star is spotted, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the entire star is emitting at an effective temperature of 5500 K, but in reality, parts are hotter and cooler. But the photosphere is in LTE, meaning each region is in LTE. So the photosphere as a whole must be considered, but the problem is about the ratio of Ti levels in the photosphere. Wait, but if some regions are cooler, does that affect the average ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when they aren't. Because the overall Teff is 5500 K when spots are present, so the photosphere's effective temperature is lower. So maybe the ratio of Ti levels is a function of the photospheric temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But the photosphere is in LTE, so perhaps each part of the photosphere is in LTE with its own temperature. So the photons we observe are a combination of the two regions.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So perhaps the ratio is an average over the entire photosphere. Or perhaps the majority of the photons come from one region. Hmm.

Wait, the transition wavelength is about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. Wait, but maybe that's not too relevant here—since it's just the energy difference between the two levels, which is E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So the energy difference can be calculated.

Wait, let me get back to the problem. The key is to find the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has no spots (Teff=6000 K) versus when it has spots (Teff=5500 K). So the ratio n2/n1 depends on the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

So the ratio is (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)) for each temperature. So the factor is [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] because when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases.

Wait, let me compute that. Let’s denote the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. Then the ratio without spots is R1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and with spots it's R2 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The factor is R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because -ΔE/(k T1) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1). So the exponent becomes ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, but wait, no. Let me compute it step by step. So R1/R2 = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, because -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ].

Yes, that's correct.

But wait, T1 is 6000 K and T2 is 5500 K when spots are present. So plug in T1=6000, T2=5500.

So 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1, so (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive, so exp( positive ) is greater than 1. So R1/R2 is greater than 1. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 (with spots) is lower than R1 (without spots). So our calculation shows that R1 is higher than R2, which aligns with the observation.

So now, we can compute the factor R1/R2.

First, we need to compute ΔE. The transition corresponds to a wavelength λ=1448 Å. So using the relation E = hc/λ.

Constants: h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and 1 Å is 1e-10 meters.

So λ =1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1.448e-7 m) = approximately 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But since we're dealing with energy differences per particle, that's fine.

But in terms of temperature in terms of k (Boltzmann constant), we can compute ΔE/(k) in units of eV or just numerically.

Wait, let's compute ΔE/(k) in terms of (eV/K), but perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

But to compute ΔE/(k):

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.372e-18)/(1.38e-23) ≈ around 99400 K. So that's about 9.94e4 K.

Wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me be more precise.

Compute E = hc/λ = (6.62607015e-34 J s) * (299792458 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Let me compute hc: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J m.

Divide by λ=1448e-10 m: 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Then, E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.380649e-23 J/K) ≈ 9938 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 9938 K.

So, the exponent is E/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 9938 * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

Compute 1/5500 = approx 0.0001818, and 1/6000 = approx 0.00016667.

So 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001513.

Multiply by 9938: 9938 * 0.00001513 ≈ let's compute that.

9938 * 0.00001513 = approximately 9938 * 1.513e-5.

Compute 9938 * 1.513e-5.

1.513e-5 = 0.00001513.

9938 * 0.00001513 = Let's compute 10000 * 0.00001513 = 0.1513, minus 62 * 0.00001513.

Wait, 9938 = 10000 - 62.

So 10000 * 0.00001513 = 0.1513.

62 * 0.00001513 = approx 0.000938.

So 0.1513 - 0.000938 ≈ 0.15036.

So the exponent is approximately 0.15036.

So the factor is exp(0.15036) ≈ e^0.15. Let me remember that e^0.1 is about 1.105, e^0.2 is about 1.2214.

0.15 is between them. Let's compute e^0.15.

We can compute it as Taylor series or use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, 0.15 is 3/20. Let me calculate:

e^0.15 = 1 + 0.15 + (0.15)^2/2 + (0.15)^3/6 + (0.15)^4/24.

Compute each term:

0.15^2=0.0225, divided by 2 gives 0.01125.

0.15^3=0.003375, divided by 6 gives 0.0005625.

0.15^4=0.00050625, divided by 24 gives approx 0.00002109.

So adding up:

1 + 0.15 = 1.15

+ 0.01125 → 1.16125

+ 0.0005625 → 1.1618125

+ 0.00002109 → ~1.1618336.

But I might be missing higher terms, but this should be close enough. Alternatively, I remember that e^0.15 is approximately 1.1618.

Wait, but wait, let me quickly check with a calculator approach. Using a calculator, e^0.15 is approximately 1.1618.

So the factor R1/R2 is about 1.1618.

Wait, but that's the factor by which the ratio increases when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So it's about 1.16.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1.1. Hmm, but 1.16 is closer to 1.2, which isn't an option. Oh, wait, looking at the options again: options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, but that's not matching. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the exponent.

Wait, I calculated E/(k) as approximately 9938 K.

Then, the term (1/T2 - 1/T1) was 1/5500 - 1/6000.

Wait, 5500 is 5.5e3, 6000 is 6e3.

Compute 1/5500 = 0.000181818..., 1/6000=0.000166666...

So the difference is 0.000181818... - 0.000166666... = 0.0000151515... which is approximately 1.51515e-5.

Multiply by 9938: 9938 * 1.51515e-5 = let's compute.

9938 * 1.51515e-5 = let's compute 9938 * 1.51515e-5.

Alternatively, 9938 * (1.51515/1e5) ) = (9938 * 1.51515)/1e5.

Compute 9938 * 1.51515:

Well, 10,000 *1.51515 = 15151.5.

So 10,000 -62 = 9938. So 9938 * 1.51515 = 15151.5 - (62 * 1.51515).

Compute 62 *1.51515: 60 *1.51515 = 90.909, 2 *1.51515=3.0303. Total 93.9393.

So 15151.5 - 93.9393 = 15057.56.

So 15057.56 / 1e5 = 0.1505756.

So the exponent is approximately 0.1506.

So e^0.1506 is approximately 1.162. So the factor is about 1.16.

But none of the options are near 1.16. The closest is A) ~1.1. Hmm. So that's a problem because 1.16 is about 1.16, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in E/(k). Let me recompute E/(k).

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s)/(1448e-10 m).

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J.

E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.380649e-23 J/K) = 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = approx 9940 K.

Wait, that's the same as before.

So where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is not about the overall Teff but the temperature of the spots. Because when spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K, but the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature than 6000 K, but that's unlikely. Wait, no, spots are cooler, so the unspotted regions must be at the same 6000 K as before. But then how does the overall Teff drop? Because the average of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at a lower temperature.

Let me compute what the spot temperature would be such that the overall Teff is 5500 K.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the flux F is sigma * T^4.

The total flux when spots are present would be F_total = (0.6 * F_6000) + (0.4 * F_spot).

But the overall Teff is 5500 K, so F_total = sigma * (5500)^4.

So sigma * 5500^4 = 0.6 * sigma *6000^4 + 0.4 * sigma * T_spot^4.

We can divide both sides by sigma:

5500^4 = 0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Compute each term.

First, compute 6000^4: 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 *1e12. 5.5^4: 5.5^2=30.25; 5.5^4= (30.25)^2=915.0625. So 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So:

9.150625e14 = 0.6 * 1.296e15 + 0.4 * T_spot^4.

Compute 0.6 *1.296e15: 0.6 *1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So, 9.150625e14 = 7.776e14 + 0.4*T_spot^4.

Subtract: 9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14 = 0.4*T_spot^4.

Divide by 0.4: T_spot^4 = (1.374625e14)/(0.4) = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root: T_spot = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Compute 3.43656e14 is 3.43656e14 = 3.43656 x 1e14.

The fourth root of 1e14 is 1e3.5, because (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3.5)^4 = 1e14.

Wait, 1e3 is 10^3, 1e4 is 10^4; but 1e3.5 is sqrt(1e7) = ~3162.28.

Wait, let me compute (3.43656e14)^(1/4).

Compute logarithm: log10(3.43656e14) = log10(3.43656) + 14 ≈ 0.536 +14 =14.536.

Divide by 4: 14.536 /4 =3.634.

So 10^3.634 ≈ 10^0.634 *10^3.

10^0.634 ≈ 4.25 (since 10^0.6≈3.98, 10^0.63≈4.17, 10^0.634≈4.2).

So T_spot ≈4200 K.

Wait, that's a significant drop. So the spots are at about 4200 K.

But now, how does this affect the ratio of Ti levels? Because the photosphere is in LTE, but there are regions at 6000 K and 4200 K. So the observed ratio would be an average of the two regions.

Wait, but the problem says to consider the ratio in the stellar photosphere. So perhaps each part of the photosphere is in LTE, but the overall ratio is an average based on the contribution from each region.

But wait, the number of Ti atoms in each region depends on the temperature. In hotter regions, more ionization occurs, but we're talking about neutral Ti, so perhaps in cooler regions, more neutral atoms are present.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of Ti in two levels decreases. So the ratio without spots is higher than with.

But if the average ratio is a weighted average, with more contribution from the cooler regions (40% spots), then perhaps the average ratio is lower.

But how do we compute the average ratio? That's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, so the ratio is based on that temperature. But then, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is at 6000 K. That would make the factor R1/R2 = exp( (E/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ), which is what I calculated earlier as about 1.16.

But none of the answer options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio in the opposite way. Without spots, the ratio is R1, and with spots, it's R2. So the factor is R1/R2.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had R1 as the ratio without spots (6000 K), and R2 as the ratio with spots (5500 K). So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ≈ 1.16.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R2 < R1, so R1/R2 >1.

So which option is close to 1.16? The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, none of these. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the transition is forbidden, or perhaps the ionization state changes. But the question says it's neutral Ti, so ionization might not be the issue.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the effective temperature of the entire photosphere when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K, so the ratio is calculated at 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E/(k)) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) ≈ 1.16.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in E/(k).

Wait, let me recompute E/(k) with more precise numbers.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s

c = 299792458 m/s

λ = 1448e-10 m.

E = hc/λ = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / 1448e-10.

Compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = 1.98644586e-25 J m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.98644586e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J.

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.380649e-23) = (1.372 / 1.380649) * 1e5.

Compute 1.372 /1.380649 ≈ 0.994.

So approximately 0.994e5 K = 99,400 K.

Wait, earlier I thought it was about 9938 K, but that was a mistake. Because 1e5 is 100,000. So E/(k) is approximately 99,400 K.

Wait, that's a big change. So E/(k) is about 99,400 K.

So now, the exponent is (99400 K) * (1/5500 - 1/6000).

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000≈0.000166667.

Difference is ≈0.00001515.

Multiply by 99400: 99400 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.506.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So e^1.506 ≈ 4.5.

Wait, because e^1.5 ≈4.4817. So that's about 4.5.

So the factor R1/R2 is approximately 4.5.

Ah, that's option C. So the factor is about 4.5.

But wait, why did I get a different value for E/(k)? Because I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's recompute E/(k).

E = 1.372e-18 J.

k =1.380649e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = 1.372e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ (1.372 /1.380649) * 1e5.

1.372 /1.380649 ≈ approximately 0.994.

So 0.994 * 1e5 = 99,400 K.

Yes, that's correct. So earlier I mistakenly thought E/(k) was ~10,000 K, but it's ~100,000 K.

So the exponent is 99,400 K * (1/5500 -1/6000) = 99,400 * (0.00001515) ≈ 1.506.

So e^1.506 ≈4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (temperature without spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (temperature with spots).

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference \( \Delta E \)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio \( \Delta E / k \) is then:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.380649 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the exponent
The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( \Delta E / k = 99,400 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
99,400 \cdot 0.00001515 \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This corresponds to option **C**.
