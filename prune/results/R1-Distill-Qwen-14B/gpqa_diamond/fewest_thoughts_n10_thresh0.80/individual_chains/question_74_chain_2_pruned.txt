Okay, so I've got this question here about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about the decay probability of a single atom. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, so each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. But wait, the problem says it's a single atom, so that's a bit tricky because the decay is probabilistic.

The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, if we have a bunch of atoms, 32% of them would decay in that time. But since we're dealing with a single atom, I think we have to model this using the concept of half-life or maybe the decay constant.

Wait, wait. The key here is that the decay follows an exponential decay law. The general formula for the number of undecayed atoms N(t) is N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But since the question is about a single atom, the probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt). 

But the data given is that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. So the probability of decay within 100 minutes, P(100), is 32% or 0.32. That means the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. 

So, using the exponential formula for the survival probability: P(not decayed after t) = e^(-λ t) = 0.68 when t = 100. So we can solve for λ.

Let me compute λ. We have e^(-λ *100) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ*100. So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100. 

Calculating ln(0.68): I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, and since 0.68 is less than 1, the ln will be negative. Let me approximate ln(0.68). Hmm, I remember that ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so the ln would be less negative. Maybe around -0.385. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it exactly using a calculator. Oh wait, I can't use a calculator right now, but I can proceed symbolically. So, λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100. Because 1/0.68 is about 1.4706. So ln(1.4706) is approximately 0.385. So λ is about 0.385 / 100 = 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, but let me think again. The decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so the survival is 6
