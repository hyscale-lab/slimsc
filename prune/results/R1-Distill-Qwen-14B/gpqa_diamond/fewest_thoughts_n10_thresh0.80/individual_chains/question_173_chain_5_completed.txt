Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says: If the uncertainty in space of an electron's location, which is traveling with speed v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, is Δx = 0.1 nm. Based on this information, I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm. I remember this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Oh right, the principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but how does that relate to energy uncertainty? Oh, right, because the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle can also be applied to energy and time. But wait, in this case, the question is about position and momentum uncertainty leading to energy uncertainty. Or perhaps I should think in terms of kinetic energy since the electron is moving.

Let me think. The problem gives me the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the velocity (v), but wait, no, actually, the velocity is given as v = 2e8 m/s. Wait, but I'm not sure if I should use that velocity directly or if I need to compute the momentum uncertainty from it.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at least ħ/2. So Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Then, since momentum p is mass times velocity, but here we don't know the uncertainty in velocity, but we do know the velocity. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the speed is given as v, but the problem is about the uncertainty in the electron's location, which is Δx. So perhaps I can find the uncertainty in momentum Δp from Δx and the Heisenberg principle.

So let's write down the formula: Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. Because the problem says to estimate the minimum uncertainty, so maybe we can take the equality (ignoring the ½ factor as an approximation).

So, solving for Δp: Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Wait, but ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So plugging in the numbers.

Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

So Δp ≈ (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) → Let's compute that.

Wait, 2 * 1e-10 is 2e-10. So 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = approximately (1e-34 / 2e-10) = (1/2) * 1e-24 → 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but I think the formula is Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx), so let me compute that. So 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-10) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-10) ) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 → 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

So Δp ≈ 5e-25 kg·m/s.

But wait, the problem is about energy uncertainty, not momentum. How do I get from Δp to ΔE?

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Oh wait, I recall that the uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum via the kinetic energy formula. Because the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

So if there's an uncertainty in p, Δp, then the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔK would be roughly ( (p + Δp)^2 - p^2 ) / (2m), assuming p is much larger than Δp, which I think is the case here. But maybe it's better to use the derivative approach for small uncertainties. So, ΔK ≈ (dK/dp) * Δp.

The derivative of K with respect to p is (2p)/(2m) = p/m. So ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but wait, p is the momentum, which is m*v. So p = m*v. So substituting, (p/m) = v. So ΔK ≈ v * Δp.

Oh, that's a neat relationship. So ΔK ≈ v * Δp.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, when p is large and Δp is small, K = p²/(2m). The uncertainty in K, ΔK, can be approximated using the derivative: ΔK ≈ (dK/dp) * Δp = (p/m) * Δp. Since p = m v, this gives v * Δp.

Yes, that makes sense. So ΔK ≈ v * Δp.

So putting the numbers in: v is 2e8 m/s, and Δp is about 5e-25 kg·m/s.

So ΔK ≈ (2e8 m/s) * (5e-25 kg·m/s) → Let's compute that.

Multiply 2e8 by 5e-25 → 10e-17 → which is 1e-16 J.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again: 2e8 * 5e-25 = (2 *5) * 1e8 * 1e-25 = 10 * 1e-17 = 1e-16 J.

So the uncertainty in kinetic energy is about 1e-16 J.

But wait, the question asks for the minimum uncertainty in the energy. So this would be the ΔE.

Wait, but wait a second. Energy uncertainty can also relate to the uncertainty in momentum and kinetic energy. But in this case, since the electron is moving at a certain speed, maybe the kinetic energy is the main contribution to the energy uncertainty.

So according to this calculation, the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately 1e-16 J, which corresponds to option D.

But wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Heisenberg Uncertainty: Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2 → Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx)
   ħ is approx 1e-34 J·s.
   Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.
   So Δp ≈ (1e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) → 1e-34 / 2e-10 = 5e-25 kg·m/s.

2. ΔE (kinetic) ≈ v * Δp → v is 2e8 m/s.
   So 2e8 * 5e-25 = 1e-16 J.

So the answer should be option D: ~1e-16 J.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the Heisenberg Uncertainty is written without the ½ factor, so maybe I overestimated it. Let me see: if I use Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, so the minimum Δp is ħ/(2Δx). Alternatively, sometimes people just use ΔxΔp ≈ ħ for an order-of-magnitude estimate.

If I were to ignore the ½ factor, then Δp ≈ ħ/Δx → (1e-34) / (1e-10) ) = 1e-24 kg·m/s. Then ΔE would be v * Δp = 2e8 * 1e-24 = 2e-16 J. Still, this is about 2e-16 J, which is option D (1e-16) or D's range is ~1e-16. So the order of magnitude is the same.

Hmm. So the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be D.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, the uncertainty in position is given as Δx = 0.1 nm = \(1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), and \(\hbar\) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). Solving for the uncertainty in momentum, \(\Delta p\), we get:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in kinetic energy, \(\Delta K\), can be approximated using the relationship:

\[
\Delta K \approx v \cdot \Delta p,
\]

where \(v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the velocity of the electron. Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta K \approx (2 \times 10^8) \cdot (5.27 \times 10^{-25}) \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately \(1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}\), which corresponds to option D.
