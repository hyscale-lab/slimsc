Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, which produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and uses reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, I need to figure out what's happening in each of these reactions. Starting with the first one.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, what usually happens? Oh right, nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. So the ketone would react with cyanide ions. The product would be a cyanohydrin. But wait, what's a cyanohydrin? I think it's when a hydroxyl and a cyano group are added to the carbonyl carbon. So the ketone becomes an alcohol and a nitrile on the same carbon.

Butan-2-one has two methyl groups on the carbonyl. Adding NaCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Butan-2-one is actually (CH3)2CO, so the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the carbonyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(COCH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, butane has four carbons. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so it's:

CH3
|
C=O
|
CH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one would be (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. So the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, butane is four carbons, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the carbonyl is on carbon 2. So the structure is:

CH2-CH3
|    |
C(=O)
CH3

Wait, no. Butan-2-one is methylacetone, which is (CH3)2CO. So the structure is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Butan-2-one has four carbons, with the ketone on C2. So the structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH3. No, wait, but that's pentan-2-one. Oh wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the structure is CH2(CO)CH3? No, but that's only three carbons. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps it's better to move forward because I think the reaction mechanism is what's important here.

So, in the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. The ketone will undergo nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, adding a CN group, and the oxygen becomes an -O- which then gets protonated. Wait, but in the product, we're getting a hydroxyl group and a nitrile on the same carbon. So that's the formation of a cyanohydrin.

So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Now, looking at the product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons. The hydroxy and methyl are on the same carbon as the nitrile.

So, the product has four carbons: the nitrile is on C1, then C2 has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, that's not right. Wait, butane is four carbons, so but
