Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A to D, each giving possible A and B reagents. The options are combinations of H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what each reaction is doing. Let's take it one at a time.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. So what happens when a ketone reacts with cyanide?

Wait, I remember that the nucleophilic addition to ketones usually involves adding something like HCN. But NaCN in a reaction with ketones... Oh, wait! Maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Cyanohydrin formation typically involves a ketone reacting with HCN. The mechanism is that the ketone attacks the HCN, leading to the formation of an enol, which then tautomerizes to the cyanohydrin. But in this case, the reagent is NaCN. So maybe it's providing the CN- ion. How does that work?

Wait, I think that HCN is a weak acid, so in some cases, when you add a strong base, you can generate CN- ions. For example, using NaCN in a protic solvent like water or perhaps in acidic conditions. Oh, wait, but for cyanohydrin formation, I think you typically use HCN under acidic conditions or maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition where NaCN acts as a nucleophile. But NaCN is a source of CN- which is a good nucleophile. But ketones generally don't react with CN- on their own because they're not that electrophilic. Unless activated.

Wait, wait, maybe the first reaction is the addition of cyanide to the ketone. So butan-2-one (acetone) has a carbonyl group. The cyano group would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the mechanism would be: acetone (CH3)2CO reacting with CN- (from NaCN). But wait, acetone is a ketone, so the carbonyl is less reactive than aldehydes. So would that happen?

Hmm, maybe we need a catalyst or some acidic conditions. Oh, wait! I think that NaCN in the presence of an acid might protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which would allow CN- to attack
