Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about dyes and the colors they emit or absorb. Hmm, let me think. The question says that a textile dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons system and emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. They're asking what color is absorbed by the compound.

Wait, I remember that when a compound absorbs light, it emits the complementary color? Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the absorbed light is the one that corresponds to the energy gap in the molecule. And the color we see is what's emitted, which is the complementary color to the absorbed one.

So the compound emits light with a certain energy, which relates to the wavelength. The energy E is related to wavelength λ by E = hc/λ. Wait, but wait, here the energy is given as 2.3393 eV. I think I need to convert that into wavelength to find the emitted color.

Let me get the constants straight. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. Oh, and since eV is an electronvolt, 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

So E (in J) is 2.3393 eV multiplied by 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me calculate that. 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.746e-19 J.

Now, E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers: (6.626e-34 J·s * 3.0e8 m/s) / 3.746e-19 J.

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 3.746e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.746e-19 ≈ 5.306e-7 m. So that's 530.6 nm. 

Wait, what color is around 530 nm? I remember the visible spectrum: red is ~650-700, orange ~590-620, yellow ~570-590, green ~495-570, blue ~450-495, violet ~380-450. So 530 is right in the green part. But wait, no, wait. Wait, 530 is actually in the green range, but wait, I think I might have messed up the numbers. Let me think: 400 is violet, 500 blue, 570 green, 600 yellow, 700 red. So 530 is greenish.

But
