Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but from the galaxy's frame, wouldn't the ejecta be moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s? Oh right, because in different frames, the velocities are opposite. So if the ejecta sees the galaxy moving towards them at 60,000, then the galaxy sees the ejecta moving towards at 60,000. Because velocity is relative here.

The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so I guess I need to find out how much time passes in the galaxy's frame for those 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Because the distance traveled would be velocity multiplied by time, but the time has to be in the same frame as the velocity.

Wait, time dilation comes into play here because of special relativity, right? Because when objects are moving at high speeds relative to each other, their time experiences are different. So the galaxy frame's time will be different from the ejecta frame's time.

The formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * t, where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, which way does the time go? Oh right, time in the moving frame (ejecta) is dilated as seen from the stationary frame (galaxy). Or wait, no, wait. The galaxy is observing the ejecta moving, so from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock runs slower. So if the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds pass, the galaxy would see less time passing, right? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, let me clarify. From the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving. So the gamma factor would be for the ejecta. So the time experienced in the galaxy (t) is longer than the time in the ejecta (t'). Because when you're moving relative to a frame, your time runs slower. So t'
