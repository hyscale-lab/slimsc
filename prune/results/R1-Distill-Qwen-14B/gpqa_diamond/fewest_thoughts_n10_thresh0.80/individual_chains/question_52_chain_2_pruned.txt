Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll walk through my thought process step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. So, we have a star with certain parameters. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in different energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) )

Here, n_i and n_j are the populations of levels i and j, g is the statistical weight, and E is the energy. k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The ratio in question is (n1 / n2). So, when the star is without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases. So when the spots are present, the effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, but what is the actual effect on the photospheric temperature? Does the presence of spots lower the overall Teff because spots are cooler regions? I think so. Spots are darker, meaning they are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the average Teff drops.

But in the problem, the value given is the overall Teff when spots are present. So the photosphere's effective temperature is lower when spots are present.

Wait, but the photosphere itself might have varying temperatures. The spots are cooler regions, so the overall observed Teff is a
