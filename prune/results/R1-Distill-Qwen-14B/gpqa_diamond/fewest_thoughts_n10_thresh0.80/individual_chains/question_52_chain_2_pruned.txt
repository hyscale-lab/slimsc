Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is about a star with certain characteristics—radius and mass—and how the presence of dark spots on its surface affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that when stars have spots, they can change their observed temperature and other properties. 

So, the star's normal effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K when there are no spots. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the effective temperature go down? Oh right, because the spots are cooler regions, so covering part of the surface with them reduces the overall emission, making the star appear cooler.

Now, the main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when there are spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, factor = ratio_without_spots / ratio_with_spots.

The problem states that the transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. I think that's important because the ionization state of Ti would depend on the temperature. Titanium can exist in various ionization states, and the excitation between energy levels is temperature-dependent.

Wait, the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so I can use the Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations. The Boltzmann equation is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). 

The ratio depends on the temperature, the degeneracy of each level (g1 and g2), and the energy difference between the levels. Since the problem gives a wavelength for the transition, I can find the energy difference using E = hc/λ.

But wait, the question is about the ratio changing when the effective temperature changes. So, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, but wait—does the Teff refer to the entire star's emission, or is it the temperature of the photosphere where these Ti atoms are? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Oh, wait, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases." So the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So the temperature governing the Boltzmann ratio is the photospheric Teff.

So, without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. So the ratio of Ti levels when there are no spots (R1) is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and when there are spots (R2) it's (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), where T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K.

So, the ratio without spots over with spots is R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1
