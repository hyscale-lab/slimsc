Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a light beam moving through a glass block, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Oh, right, the direction matters. So the light is propagating towards the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer as well. Or wait, the question says the glass is moving toward the observer. No, wait, the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.

The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh wait, but the beam is moving toward the observer. Wait, if the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer, then the glass is moving toward the observer as well. Hmm, that makes sense.

I remember something about the velocity of light in different frames. Oh, right, according to special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. So regardless of the motion of the source or the medium, the speed of light in a vacuum is c. But wait, this isn't a vacuum; it's glass. So the speed of light in glass is normally c/n, where n is the refractive index.

But wait, the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame? I think in classical mechanics, velocities add linearly, but relativity uses a different approach.

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So we need to find the velocity of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Oh, right, this is a situation where you have to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula for adding velocities when moving from one frame to another moving at velocity v relative to the first.

The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, wait, that's when u is the velocity in the original frame and the other frame is moving at v relative to the original. Or maybe I should think in terms of the lab frame and the glass frame.

Wait, in the glass frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n towards the observer. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n.

But wait, the glass is moving at v relative to the lab frame (S). So, I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame. So, let me think: S' is the glass frame moving at velocity v relative to S (the lab frame). Wait, no, the glass is moving at velocity v in the direction of the light beam. So from the lab frame's perspective, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light.

Wait, in S' (glass frame), the light speed is u' = c/n. Now, to find u (the speed in the lab frame S), we can apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

Wait, but wait, the direction matters. Because if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, which is toward the observer, then in the glass frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n towards the observer. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass frame, but wait, no, the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. But wait, in S', the glass is stationary, and the lab is moving at -v relative to S'.

Wait, maybe I should set up the frames correctly. Let me define S as the lab frame, and S' as the frame moving at velocity v relative to S. So S' is the glass's rest frame.

In S', the speed of light is u' = c/n. So to find u, the speed in S, we use the velocity addition formula. But wait, how are the velocities directed?

In S', the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion relative to S. So in S', the light's velocity is u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (v is the speed of S' relative to S). So when applying the transformation, the direction is the same.

So applying the velocity addition formula:

u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/c² ]

But wait, in this case, u' is the speed in S', which is moving at v relative to S. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, perhaps v and u' are in the same direction, so we can plug them into the formula.

So u' = c/n, v is the velocity of S' relative to S.

So substituting into the formula:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplifying denominator:

= ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate denominators:

Numerator: c + n v

Denominator: n c + v

So u becomes (c + n v) / (n c + v )

But wait, the speed of light in the lab frame can't be more than c. Let me check the units. If v is much smaller than c, and n is greater than 1, then (c + n v)/(n c + v) ≈ (c + n v) / (n c) ) = 1/(n) + v/(n c). So when v is very small, u approaches c/n, which is correct because in the glass at rest, the speed is c/n.

But wait, what's the question again? The speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab. Wait, no, the speed of light in the glass is c/n in any frame, but when the glass is moving, the observed speed from the lab is different.

Wait, no, the speed of light in the medium is always c/n, but the observed speed in the lab frame depends on the motion of the medium. Oh wait, no. Because from the lab frame, the medium is moving, so the light's speed isn't just c/n anymore. It's adjusted by the velocity addition formula.

So from the calculation, u = (c + n v)/(n c + v) * c? Wait, wait, no. Wait, when I substituted in the formula, I used u' as c/n. So the expression I got is ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + (c/n v)/c² ) = ( (c + n v )/(n) ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, let me recompute.

Compute denominator: 1 + (u' v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c )

So denominator is 1 + v/(n c )

The numerator is (c/n + v ). 

So, putting together:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute this correctly. Let me write it as:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Wait, the denominator is 1 + ( (c v)/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So, u = ( (c + n v)/n ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to make it easier:

Numerator: (c + n v) * c

Denominator: (n c) * (1 + v/(n c)) ) → n c + v

So u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But wait, c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Wait, but we've got an expression for u. However, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Wait, but when the glass is moving, the speed as observed is u, which is given by this expression.

But wait, looking at the options, the expressions are in terms of n and v. Let me see what the options are.

Options:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v)

B) 1

C) (1 + n v)/(n - v )

D) (1 - n v)/(n + v )

Wait, the options don't have c in them. Oh, the problem says to take c = 1. So in natural units where c=1, the formula becomes:

u = ( (1 + n v) ) / (n + v )

Wait, wait, when I set c=1, the expression becomes:

u = [ (1 + n v) ] / (n + v )

So that's option A.

But wait, let me recheck my calculations in natural units.

In S', the speed is u' = 1/n (since c=1). The velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v )

So substituting u' = 1/n, we get:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate denominators:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which is option A.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the speed of light in the glass as observed from the lab would be different. But the formula gives (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let me think about units. If v is much smaller than 1, say v<<1, then u ≈ (1 + n v)/(n) ) ≈ 1/n + v/(n) *n? Wait, let me expand the denominator.

(1 + n v)/(n + v) ≈ [1 + n v ] / n (1 + v/n )^{-1} ≈ [1 + n v ] /n (1 - v/n )

Multiplying out: (1 +n v)(1 - v/n ) /n ≈ [1*(1) +1*(-v/n) + n v *1 + n v * (-v/n)] /n

Which becomes [1 - v/n + n v - v² ] /n.

Since v is small, v² is negligible. So:

[1 + (n v - v/n) ] /n = [1 + ( (n² v -v )/n ) ] /n = [1 + v(n² -1)/n ] /n.

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, for small v, u ≈ (1 +n v )/(n) ) * [1 - v/n ].

Wait, let me compute (1 +n v )/(n + v) when v is small.

n + v ≈ n (1 + v/n )

So (1 +n v ) / (n (1 +v/n )) ) ≈ (1 +n v )/(n) * (1 - v/n )

= [ (1/n) (1 +n v) ) ] (1 -v/n )

= [ (1/n + v ) ] (1 -v/n )

= 1/n (1 - v/n ) + v (1 - v/n )

= 1/n - v/n² + v - v²/n.

Ignore higher order terms:

≈ 1/n + v ( 1 - 1/n² )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. But the main point is, when v is zero, u=1/n, which is correct. So the formula gives the correct result when the glass is at rest. And when v approaches zero, the formula approaches 1/n. So option A seems correct.

So the correct answer is option A: (1 +n v )/(n +v )


To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the light beam is propagating through the glass with a refractive index \( n \). In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the speed of light is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) (in natural units).

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

we substitute \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (the speed of light in the glass in its rest frame) and \( c = 1 \). This gives:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This expression represents the speed of light in the glass as observed in the laboratory frame. Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option A:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**

This result is consistent with the principles of special relativity, as the speed of light remains finite and dependent on the refractive index and the velocity of the glass. When \( v = 0 \), the speed reduces to \( 1/n \), which is the expected speed of light in a stationary medium. For small \( v \), the expression also aligns with classical velocity addition when relativistic effects are negligible.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
