Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Schrödinger cat state and calculating its non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The state given is a superposition of two coherent states, right? The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)).

The non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

I remember that Gaussian states are those like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like Fock states or certain superpositions of coherent states.

Wait, the problem is asking to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

So, let's think about the setup. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but a superposition of two different coherent states can be non-Gaussian, especially if the overlap between them is significant.

But wait, sometimes certain superpositions might actually be Gaussian. For example, a coherent state is a Gaussian state. If I have a superposition of two coherent states that are orthogonal, maybe the state ends up being non-Gaussian. Or maybe if they're not orthogonal, perhaps it's still Gaussian?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Let's plug in phi = -pi/4. So, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N.

But wait, N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Let's compute sin(2phi) for phi = -pi/4. 2 phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1) exp(-2*(0.5)^2 )).

Let me calculate exp(-2*(0.5)^2). 0.5 squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So N is sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So putting it all together, |psi> is approximately [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states with amplitudes alpha and -alpha. They are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a. A superposition of these might form an entangled state if they are not orthogonal.

But wait, when you take a superposition of two coherent states, it's not clear if the resulting state is Gaussian or not. In some cases, if the superposition is between two orthogonal coherent states, perhaps it's non-Gaussian.

But wait, what about the density matrix of |psi>? The state |psi> is a pure state, so its density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The reference state tau is a Gaussian state. So, what Gaussian state are we considering here? I think it's the reference Gaussian state that the question refers to, but I don't have more details. Oh wait, the relative entropy is between rho and tau, where tau is the
