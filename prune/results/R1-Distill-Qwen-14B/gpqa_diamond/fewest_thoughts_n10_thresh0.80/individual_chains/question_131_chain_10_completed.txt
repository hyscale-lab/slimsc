Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully and break it down step by step.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR spectra are given: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Wait, 1H NMR showing a single peak at 7 ppm. That's probably an aromatic proton, but wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride. So the anhydride likely has a conjugated structure, maybe with an exocyclic double bond.

Wait, when a cis-alkene is dehydrated, the product would have conjugated double bonds. For example, if the starting acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, that's not a cis-alkene. No, wait, the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene. So maybe something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't right because that's just single bonds. Oh wait, no, the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene, so maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, if it's a diacid with a cis-alkene, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but that's just saturated. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and the double bond is cis. So when this is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride.

Wait, dehydrating a diacid with a double bond would form an anhydride. Let me think about the structure. If the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. But if it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, the dehydration would form a five-membered cyclic anhydride. But if the starting material has a cis-alkene, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, maybe HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't the right structure.

Wait, maybe it's HOOC-(CH2)n-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH. No, wait, that might not make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the diacid is with a double bond between the two COOH groups. Wait, no, because that would be a molecule, not a diacid.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond in the chain. So for dehydration, perhaps it's a ring formation. Wait, but when you dehydrate a diacid, you lose two water molecules to form an anhydride. So the structure after dehydration would probably be a cyclic anhydride.

Wait, the key here is that the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR. So that suggests that all the protons are equivalent, or perhaps there's only one type of proton. Alternatively, if it's a single peak, maybe it's a singlet with only one proton, but that seems unlikely because 7 ppm is usually aromatic or an sp2 proton.

Wait, but the starting material is a cis-alkene. So when it's dehydrated, the structure will have a conjugated double bond. So maybe the anhydride is a structure like bicyclic, or maybe a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, the 13C NMR of the anhydride has two peaks: one at 137 ppm, which is a typical sp2 carbon, maybe a double bond or an aromatic ring. The other is at 165 ppm, which is usually a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone or an ester or anhydride.

So, in the anhydride, perhaps two carbons are the carbonyls, but wait, the 13C has two peaks. So maybe the anhydride has two identical carbonyl groups. So the structure is a five-membered ring, like a maleic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups.

Wait, maleic anhydride is an example where the 13C NMR would show two carbonyl carbons, but wait, in maleic anhydride, the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, so there's only one peak in the 13C. Hmm, but wait, the question says the 13C has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. So 137 is an sp2 carbon, maybe a double bond, and 165 is the carbonyl.

So in the anhydride, perhaps there's a double bond and two carbonyl groups. So the structure would have a double bond and two carbonyls. So perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure like a cyclopentene-based anhydride.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is something like a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where the anhydride has a conjugated double bond.

Wait, another thought: if the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that doesn't have a double bond. So perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH. But when dehydrated, it would form a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, but the hydrogen NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe all the protons are equivalent, but that's hard unless it's a very symmetric structure. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride has no protons, but that can't be because the starting material was a diacid with a double bond.

Wait, wait, maybe the anhydride doesn't have any protons. But that's impossible because the starting material was a diacid with a cis-alkene. So the anhydride must have some protons, but perhaps they're all equivalent, giving a single peak.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a bridged structure. For example, if the diacid is a bicyclic compound, then the dehydration would form a structure with symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride's structure is such that all the protons on the double bond are equivalent, leading to a singlet in the 1H NMR. So for example, if it's a cyclic anhydride where the double bond is part of a ring with symmetry, so that the two protons are equivalent, perhaps as a trans double bond in a ring.

Wait, but the starting diacid has a cis-alkene. So when dehydrated, the double bond in the anhydride would be in the same configuration as the starting diacid?

Wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene. Upon dehydration, the alkene becomes part of the anhydride ring. So if the starting alkene is cis, the double bond in the anhydride would also be cis. But in a cyclic anhydride, the double bond is usually part of the ring, so maybe it's a five-membered ring with an exo-methylene group.

Wait, let me think about maleic anhydride as a model. Maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two double bonds (the ring is conjugated), and the two carbonyl groups. Its 1H NMR shows a pair of equivalent protons as a doublet around 6.0 ppm, if I remember correctly. But in the problem, the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. So that's a higher ppm, perhaps indicating a different environment.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is something else, like a substituted maleic anhydride. Let's think about the structure where the double bond is in a more deshielded environment. For example, if the anhydride has electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the double bond, which would deshield the protons and cause a higher shift.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak. So perhaps there's only one type of proton in the anhydride. So maybe it's a bridged bicyclic structure where all the protons are equivalent. Or maybe a very symmetric structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride has no protons attached to the oxygen or the carbonyl carbon, which is typical, but then what about the double bond? If the double bond has two protons, they might be equivalent if the structure is symmetric.

Wait, if the anhydride is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, like maleic anhydride, then the two protons on the double bond are equivalent and give a singlet? No, wait, maleic anhydride's protons are a pair of doublets. But wait, if the structure is such that the two protons are equivalent, maybe a singlet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is a substituted cyclopentene with two carbonyl groups, but the substituents make the two protons on the double bond equivalent. For example, if the substituents are symmetric, like if the two carbonyls are on the same side, making the double bond symmetric.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try to think about the reaction that the anhydride undergoes. It's reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products, major and minor.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadieneâ€”so that's a cyclopentene ring with substituents on carbons 1,2,3,4. The structure would be:

1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, the cyclopentadiene has double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions? Or is it a single conjugated diene?

Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, so it's a conjugated diene. But with four methyl groups attached to carbons 1,2,3,4.

Wait, so the structure is a cyclopentene ring, where positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group, and the ring has conjugated double bonds.

But wait, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So the ring has five members, with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. So it's a conjugated diene.

So, when this reacts with an anhydride, perhaps it's undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the diene (the cyclopentadiene) would be the diene, and the anhydride would act as the dienophile.

Wait, yes, Diels-Alder reaction between a diene and a dienophile. The dienophile is often something with a double bond, like an anhydride, a ketone, etc. So in this case, the anhydride would be the dienophile.

So the reaction would form a six-membered cyclic adduct. The dienophile (anhydride) would react with the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) to form a bicyclic structure or a bridged bicyclic structure.

Wait, but the products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3. Let me check the molecular formulas. The anhydride is from a diacid, which would have, say, the formula CnH2nO4 (if it's a cyclic anhydride, n would be such that the formula is correct). But perhaps the anhydride is something like maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. The molecular formula of the diene is C9H12. Because cyclopentadiene (C5H6) plus four methyl groups (each CH3 adds one carbon and three hydrogens, but considering the ring and double bonds, the formula would be C9H12.

Wait, let me calculate:

Cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) would give C5+4=9 carbons, and H: 6 + (4*3) = 6+12=18? Wait, but when you add a methyl group to a double bond, you have to consider the hydrogen lost. Wait, no, wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. So each methyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the double bonds.

Wait, perhaps that's getting too detailed. Let me think of the Diels-Alder reaction. The diene is the 1,3-cyclopentadiene derivative, and the dienophile is the anhydride.

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring. The product would incorporate both the diene and the dienophile. So the products would have the combined molecular formulas.

Assuming the dienophile is a five-membered ring anhydride (like maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3), and the diene is C9H12, the adduct would have (C4 + C9) = C13, and H: (2 + 12) =14? But the product's formula is C13H16O3. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is not maleic anhydride but something else. Let me think: the dienophile's formula needs to be correct. The dienophile when reacted with the diene (C9H12) gives a product of C13H16O3. So, dienophile's formula is (C13H16O3) minus (C9H12) plus H2O if any, but wait, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition without loss of any atoms. So the dienophile would have (C13H16O3 - C9H12) = C4H4O3. But maleic anhydride is C4H2O3. So perhaps it's a dienophile with more hydrogen.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile has formula C4H4O3. So, perhaps it's something like a substituted maleic anhydride, but with more hydrogen. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a different structure. Let me not get stuck here.

The problem states that the reaction yields two products: major and minor, both with molecular formula C13H16O3. So the reaction is a Diels-Alder, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.

Now, the next part: the 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the products show a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. NOESY detects through-space interactions between protons. So, in the major product, two protons are close in space, leading to a cross-peak, whereas in the minor product, they are not.

So, the major product has a certain spatial arrangement where two protons are near each other, while the minor product doesn't.

The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Wait, the cross-peak in the major product suggests that the two protons are on atoms that are close in space, meaning they are on adjacent carbons or part of the same ring structure.

In the Diels-Alder product, the endo rule suggests that the more substituted (endo) product is the major one. So, the major product would have the substituents (like the methyl groups from the diene) positioned in a way that allows for maximum orbital overlap and possibly more substituents in proximity.

But how does this relate to the NOESY cross-peak? Well, in the major product, perhaps the bridgehead protons are close, causing a cross-peak. Alternatively, in the Diels-Alder adduct, there are axial and equatorial protons. If the adduct has a bicyclic structure, certain protons may be close in space.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state leads to the major product, which has substituents on the same face, leading to a more compact structure. This could mean that certain protons are close enough to cause a NOE effect.

So, thinking about the structure: after the Diels-Alder reaction, the product is a bicyclic structure. The dienophile (anhydride) would contribute two carbonyl groups, and the diene would contribute four carbons (the cyclopentadiene with substituents). So the product would have a six-membered ring with substituents from both reactants.

Wait, maybe the product is a bridged bicyclic structure. For example, the Diels-Alder could form a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. If the dienophile is an anhydride, the adduct would have the anhydride oxygen atoms attached.

In norbornene derivatives, the endo rule suggests that substituents are placed on the same face. So, in the major product, certain protons would be close together, leading to a NOE effect.

In the norbornene structure, there are bridgehead protons. If two protons are on adjacent bridgeheads, their proximity could lead to a NOE interaction.

But looking at the options, the integrals are for different groups:

Option A: 6H singlet at 1 ppm (maybe methyl groups) and 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5.

Option C: two singlets, maybe two sets of methyl groups.

Option D: a doublet and a singlet.

In a Diels-Alder adduct, the endo product often has more substituents in the same face, which can bring certain protons closer.

In the norbornene structure, the bridgehead protons are in close proximity. So, maybe the two bridgehead protons are in proximity, leading to a NOE.

Wait, but the bridgehead protons in norbornene are usually each a singlet, but perhaps in this case, the substituents change that.

Alternatively, perhaps the two methyl groups from the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl) are located in positions that are close in space in the major product.

Wait, but the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl. So, when it reacts, the four methyl groups are attached to the cyclopentene ring. In the Diels-Alder product, those methyl groups would be positioned on the new six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the major product has two methyl groups near each other, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Looking at the options, option B has a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet. Wait, 6H singlet could be two methyl groups (each 3H, but if they're equivalent, it would be 6H as a singlet). 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be an oxygen-bearing group, like an ether or an ester.

Alternatively, the 6H singlet could be from two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a group of three methyl groups, but that's 9H, so no.

Wait, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two equivalent -CH(CH3)2 groups? That would sum to 6H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups (each with 2H?), but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the 6H singlet is from six equivalent protons, maybe all methyl groups attached to the same environment. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the NOE cross-peak, perhaps the 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm (option B) is from a set of equivalent methyl groups, and the 2H singlet is from an axial substituent.

But I'm not entirely making sense of this. Let me think about the Diels-Alder product.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state leads to substituents being positioned on the same face. So, in the product, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride's carbonyl groups) are on the same face as the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups).

So, the major product would have the anhydride's oxygen atoms on the same face as the methyl groups of the diene. In such a structure, perhaps the methyl groups are positioned in a way that brings certain protons close together.

Alternatively, the major product could have a boat-like conformation where certain protons are close, while the minor product is more chair-like, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question is about which two resonances are connected by a cross-peak. So, the cross-peak connects two protons that are close in space. Looking at the options, perhaps the 6H singlet and the 2H singlet are close.

So, option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. These could be protons on adjacent carbons, or perhaps one is on a bridge and the other is on an oxygen-bearing carbon.

Alternatively, option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, but the singlet is not coupled, so perhaps they're not adjacent but close in space.

Wait, but the cross-peak in NOESY doesn't depend on coupling; it's about spatial proximity, so even non-adjacent protons can show a cross-peak if they're close.

So, in the major product, which has a cross-peak, perhaps two sets of protons are close. For example, the 6H singlet (maybe two sets of equivalent methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (perhaps an oxygen-bearing group) are close.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three equivalent methyl groups attached to a single carbon, like a quaternary carbon. But that's 3 * 2 = 6 H? No, each methyl is 3H, so three would sum to 9H, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons, but in a symmetric environment. For example, two methyl groups on adjacent carbons in a ring, leading to equivalent protons.

Alternatively, the 6H singlet could be from three methyl groups attached to three different carbons but in equivalent positions, making their protons all equivalent and thus a singlet.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the possible structures again.

The major product is the endo product, which has substituents on the same face. So, the methyl groups from the diene are on the same face as the anhydride's substituents. This would place certain methyl groups in close proximity to each other or to other parts of the molecule.

In the endo product, the substituents are on the same face, which can lead to a situation where certain protons are close. For example, two methyl groups that are on the same face of the ring might be near each other.

So, in the NMR, the 6H singlet would correspond to two methyl groups (3H each) that are equivalent because of the molecule's symmetry. Their proximity could cause a cross-peak if they're close in space. But wait, if they're equivalent, their protons would all be in the same environment, so they would be a singlet, but they wouldn't show a cross-peak unless another set is nearby.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups that are all equivalent. But that's 9H, so no.

Wait, maybe the 6H singlet is from a geminal di-substitution, like two methyl groups on the same carbon, but that's 6H (each CH3 is 3H, two would be 6H) as a singlet. But geminal di-substitution is possible, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Another thought: in the Diels-Alder product, the endo transition state leads to the substituents being on the same side. So, perhaps the dienophile's substituents (like the anhydride groups) and the diene's substituents (the methyl groups) are on the same face, making certain protons close.

In the product, maybe a methyl group is near an oxygen-bearing group, leading to a NOE effect. For example, a methyl group (singlet at 1.7 ppm) near an oxygen where two protons are attached (a singlet at 3.5 ppm).

Wait, in option B, the 6H singlet is at 1.7 ppm, and the 2H is at 3.5 ppm. If the 6H is from two methyl groups (each 3H) attached to adjacent carbons, and the 2H is from an oxygen-bearing CH2 group, then the proximity could lead to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2H singlet is from an exo-methylene group, but that's typically around 6 ppm.

Wait, the 2H at 3.5 ppm suggests some deshielding, maybe due to being near an electronegative atom like oxygen. So, perhaps it's an -OCH2- group, but that would be split into a singlet if the two protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons.

So, if the major product has two methyl groups (6H) that are in a position close to an -OCH2- group (2H), then the NOE cross-peak would connect the 6H and 2H signals.

Looking back at the options, option B is 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. This would mean that the 6H methyl groups are near the 2H oxygen-bearing group.

So, in the major product, these two groups are close, leading to a cross-peak. In the minor product, perhaps the substituents are positioned differently, so these protons are not close, hence no cross-peak.

So, the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves a diacid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's 1H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating a symmetric environment for the protons, and its 13C NMR spectrum shows peaks at 137 ppm (sp2 carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This suggests the anhydride is a symmetric cyclic structure with a conjugated double bond and two carbonyl groups.

The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product is the endo product, where substituents are positioned on the same face due to the endo rule, leading to a more compact structure. The minor product is the exo product, where substituents are on opposite faces.

The 2D NOESY NMR spectra reveal a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor product. This indicates that in the major product, two protons are spatially close, likely due to the endo arrangement of substituents. The cross-peak connects two resonances: a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups, while the 2H singlet likely corresponds to an oxygen-bearing group (e.g., -OCH2-). These groups are positioned close in space in the major product due to the endo geometry, leading to the observed NOE interaction.

In the minor product, the exo geometry places these groups farther apart, eliminating or weakening the NOE interaction. Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

**Answer: B**
