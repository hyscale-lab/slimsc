Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in such transitions, certain selection rules apply. Oh right, for the hydrogen atom, the dipole selection rules are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Wait, but the initial state has l=0, so when it transitions, l can go to 1, since 0 +1 =1. So the first transition must be from l=0 to l=1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It can transition to a state with l=1, but what about n? The selection rule for n is that it can change by any integer, but in practice, since it's a two-step process, we probably go from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1. Because you can't go from 3 to 1 in one step since the dipole transition would require l to change by 1 each time, but wait, no, the dipole selection rule for n is actually that it can change by any integer, but for hydrogen-like atoms, the transition probabilities are determined by the matrix elements of the dipole operator. So perhaps the two-step process is more likely.

Wait, the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions. So first, 3,0,0 → some state, then that state → 1,0,0.

So first transition: from n=3, l=0 to n'=?, l=1. Because l has to change by ±1. So l must go from 0 to 1. So possible n after first transition: let's see, from n=3, it can go to n=2 or 4. But wait, when l=0, it's an s orbital, so possible transitions from 3s would be to 2p or 4p. But since in the second step it goes to 1s (n=1, l=0), we need the second transition to go from n=2, l=1 (since 2p is l=1) to n=1, l=0. So the first transition is 3s → 2p, then 2p → 1s.

Now, the possible m transitions during each step. For each dipole transition, m can change by -1, 0, +1. So for the first transition: initial m is 0, so after transition, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible states after first transition are |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩. Then, from each of these, in the second transition, m must go to 0.

Wait, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m must be 0. So the second transition must end at m=0. So for each possible state after first transition, can it transition to |1,0,0⟩?

Let me think: For each state |2,1, m⟩, the possible transitions are m→ m' where m' can be m-1, m, m+1.

So for |2,1,1⟩: m can go to 0,1,2. But since the final state is m=0, so m'=0 is possible. So yes, |2,1,1⟩ can transition to |1,0,0⟩ because m goes from 1 →0.

Similarly, |2,1,0⟩ can transition to m= -1, 0, +1. So m=0 is possible, but the final m is 0. So yes, that's allowed.

Wait, but in the first transition, when we go from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the possible m's are -1,
