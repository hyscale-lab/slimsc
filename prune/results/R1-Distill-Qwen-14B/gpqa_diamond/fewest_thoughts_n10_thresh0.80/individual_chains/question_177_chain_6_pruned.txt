Okay, let's see. So I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm. Let me read it again.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is moving at 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. 

The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2. They assume the stars radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D, each a different factor.

Wait, so I need to find the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. I remember the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Right, and since both are black bodies, this should apply.

But wait, how do the velocities come into play here? Oh, I think it's about the Doppler effect. Since Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, that would shift its emitted light. The brightness maximum (the peak wavelength) for a star is determined by its temperature. So the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature, right? Because of Wien's law: λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.898 ×10^-3 m·K).

So if both stars have the same observed λ_max, but Star_2 is moving towards us, then their actual temperatures must be different. Because the observed λ_max is shifted due to the Doppler effect.

Wait, let me think. The Doppler effect for light changes the observed wavelength. If a star is moving towards us (blue shift), the observed λ would be shorter than the rest λ. Conversely, moving away (redshift) would make λ longer.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. But Star_2 is moving towards us, which would blueshift its emitted λ_max, right? So to have the same observed λ_max, Star
