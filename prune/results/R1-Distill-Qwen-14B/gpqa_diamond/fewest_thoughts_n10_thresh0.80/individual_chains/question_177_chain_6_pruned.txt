Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. They assume the stars radiate as black bodies and want to find out by how much Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, so the key here is to compute the luminosity ratio, L1/L2. I remember that for blackbody radiation, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So λ_max1 = λ_max2.

According to Wien's law, if λ_max is the same, then the temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. Oh, that's a crucial point.

So both stars have the same temperature. Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities will depend on the ratio of their radii squared. Because L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1=T2, the T part is 1, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, but wait a second. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Therefore, (R1/R2) is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1/L2 would be 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. But wait, the options have 2.23, 2.25, etc. So the answer would be A) ~2.25. But wait, I'm probably missing something.

Wait, the question mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Do I need to consider this? Because velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe that's already accounted for in their observed wavelengths.

Wait, no. Because when we look at the star's spectrum, the peak wavelength we observe is affected by the Doppler effect if the star is moving towards or away
