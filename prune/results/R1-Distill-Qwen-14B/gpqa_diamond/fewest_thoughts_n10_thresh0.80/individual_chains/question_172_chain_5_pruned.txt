Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. So the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation states of atoms are determined by the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states but maybe also applies to excitation levels. Oh right, for excitation, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play. So the number of atoms in a particular energy level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations in two energy states is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if E2 is higher than E1 (which it is, since E difference is positive), the exponent is negative, so the ratio depends on the temperature.

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2 for a specific energy level. Let me clarify: so for a particular energy level, the population in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or is it the excitation relative to the ground state? Hmm, wait the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". Oh wait, maybe it's that the excitation to a higher level is twice as much? So the number of atoms in a higher energy level (say level 2) compared to the lower (level 1) is higher.

Let me think. The ratio of excitation is n2/n1. For star_1, n2_1 / n1_1 = factor, and for star_2, n2_2 / n1_2 is another factor. But the question states that in star_1, the level is twice as excited. So perhaps n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2). Or maybe n2_1 = 2 * n2_2? Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when
