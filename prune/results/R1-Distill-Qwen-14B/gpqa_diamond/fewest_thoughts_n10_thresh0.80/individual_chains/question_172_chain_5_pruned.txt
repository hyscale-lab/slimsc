Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let me try to think this through.

So the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between those levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so that probably means the Boltzmann equation applies here.

I remember the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states to temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of populations N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, since we're comparing two stars, star_1 and star_2, I can model their conditions. Let's denote the excitation states for each star. For star_1, the population ratio would be N1_upper/N1_lower, and for star_2, it's N2_upper/N2_lower.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. I think that means the ratio N_upper/N_lower is twice as high for star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, no, wait: the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are "twice as excited." So perhaps the
