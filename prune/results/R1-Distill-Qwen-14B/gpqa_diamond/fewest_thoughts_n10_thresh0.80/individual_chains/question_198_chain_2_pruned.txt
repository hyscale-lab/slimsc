Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-), and the stability constants for the complexes. 

Wait, stability constants, right. I remember that stability constants (also called formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So for each complex, the β1, β2, β3, β4 are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16 respectively. Hmm, that's interesting. I need to figure out which complexes we're looking at.

First, the problem states that we're dealing with dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached, so I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Wait, but the options are about the percentage of blue complexes. I'm not exactly sure which complex is blue, but I think in the case of Co(II), the different SCN complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is a different color than [Co(SCN)_3]^-, etc. But the question specifically asks about the blue dithiocyanato complexes, so maybe that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion. Not entirely sure, but I think the key here is to find the fraction of each possible complex and then sum the ones that are blue.

But wait, the problem gives four β values. Let me think about the possible complexes. Cobalt can form complexes with varying numbers of SCN- ligands. The possible complexes are:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ (monodentate, one SCN-)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (dithiocyanato)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^− (trithiocyanato)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (tetrathiocyanato)

So the β values correspond to the formation of each complex step by step. So β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^−
