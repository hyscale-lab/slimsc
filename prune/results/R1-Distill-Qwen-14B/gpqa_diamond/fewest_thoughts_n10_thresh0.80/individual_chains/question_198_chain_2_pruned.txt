Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. 

Hmm, I remember that cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate ions, and the stability constants are given. The stability constants, β, tell us how stable each complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

So, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I need to make sense of what each β represents. Oh right, the stability constant (formation constant) for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is given by β_n. So β1 is for the monosubstituted complex, β2 for the disubstituted, and so on.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species. I think dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ions, so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) complex, right? Because each SCN- is -1, so two would give charge 0 for the complex. But wait, Co(II) is +2, so with two SCN- (each -1), the total charge would be +2 - 2(1) = 0. So that makes sense.

So we need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) in the solution. But wait, there are four possible complexes here, since β4 is given. So the complexes would be:

- Co²+ (free ion)
- [Co(SCN)]+ (monosubstituted, charge +1)
- [Co(SCN)_2] (disubstituted, charge 0)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- (trisubstituted, charge -1)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-) (tetrasubstituted, charge -2)

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. The general formula for the stability constant is for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+). Wait, wait, no, the charge of the complex would be Co²+ with n SCN-.

So each SCN- is -1. For each complex, the charge is 2+ - n*(-1) = 2 + n. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Co²+ is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for n SCN- attached, the charge would be (+2) + (n * -1) = 2 - n. So the charge of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n).

Wait, maybe I should think about each complex:

n=0: Co²+
n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → because 2-1(+) → no, wait, 2 + (-1) = +1? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: each SCN- is added as a ligand. Each ligand contributes -1 charge, so for n ligands, the charge would be 2+ (from Co²+) plus n*(-1) → 2 - n.

So for n=1, [Co(SCN)]^(+1) because 2-1=+1.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → 2-2=0.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-1 → 2-3 = -1.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^(2- → 2-4= -2.

But wait, in the problem statement, the stability constants are given up to β4=16. So the complexes go up to n=4.

So the possible species are Co²+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-).

Each has a formation constant β_n, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n )

So the problem is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex, among all the Co species.

But how do we compute this? I think we need to calculate the distribution of all the species, given the concentrations and the stability constants.

The total concentration of cobalt is c_total = [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^(2-) = 1e-2 M.

And the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M.

Wait, but SCN- is in excess, so maybe we can assume that [SCN^-] is approximately constant? Or perhaps not, since it's a solution with 0.1 M SCN- and 0.01 M Co²+.

Wait, let me consider the approach. The total cobalt is 1e-2 M. The concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the [Co], which is 1e-2. So, perhaps the concentration of SCN- doesn't change much, and we can treat it as a constant. That's a common assumption in such problems, but I'm not entirely sure. However, for the sake of moving forward, I'll proceed with this assumption.

So, the idea is to compute the concentrations
