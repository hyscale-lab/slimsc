Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA. The formation constant, K, indicates how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Since the solution is stoichiometric, I suppose that the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or something similar. Wait, more accurately, the formation of the complex is: Ca²+ + EDTA^{4-} ↔ CaEDTA^{2-}, and the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^{2-}]/([Ca²+][EDTA^{4-}]).

Wait wait, but wait. The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, the concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M.

But the question is asking for the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution. So, the idea is that the complex dissociates a bit, releasing Ca²+ and EDTA^4- into the solution. But since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

At first glance, I'm thinking that because K is so large, the complex is almost completely formed, so [Ca²+] is very small. But I need to calculate it properly.

Let me set up the variables. Let's say the complex dissociates as follows:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^{4-}

The initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are zero initially. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02), [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA] = x.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the formation constant is Kf, the formation constant for the complex. So in that case, the expression for Kf is Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

But since the complex is dissociating, the reverse reaction would have K = 1/Kf. Wait no, the formation constant is for the forward reaction (formation of complex), so the dissociation would have a Kd = 1/Kf.

So for the dissoci
