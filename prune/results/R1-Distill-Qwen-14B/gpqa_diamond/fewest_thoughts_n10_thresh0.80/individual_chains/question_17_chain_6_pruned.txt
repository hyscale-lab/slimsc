Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant is a measure of how strong the complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So, in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is pretty stable since K is 5e10.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. I think the formula for the complex is probably CaY^2- or something like that. Since it's stoichiometric, the ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and the EDTA^4- (Y^4-). So the complex is [CaY]^2- or similar.

Wait, but when EDTA complexes with a metal ion like Ca²+, the reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given, which is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. So Kf is 5e10. Now, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since the complex is formed, the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions should be very low because the complex is stable (high Kf).

But wait, the problem is to find [Ca²+]. So, assuming that the solution is at equilibrium, and that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So all the complex dissociates a little into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me write the equilibrium expression. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M initially. But wait, that's not quite right because when the complex dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So, let me think in
