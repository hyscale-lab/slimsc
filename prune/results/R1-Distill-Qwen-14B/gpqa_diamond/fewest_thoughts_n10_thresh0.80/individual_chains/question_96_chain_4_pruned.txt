Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees. The galaxy is at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy. The options are A to D, ranging from 10^59 to 10^66 J/K.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, right? Oh right, the formula is S = (A/(4 l_p^2)) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length. Because l_p is sqrt(ħ G / c^3), so yeah.

So, first I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4π r^2, where r is the Schwarzschild radius. Alternatively, since the angular size is given, maybe I can find the diameter (or radius) of the event horizon from the angular size and distance.

Angular size θ in radians is approximately equal to the ratio of the size over the distance, when θ is small. So θ ≈ size / distance. Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I should convert that to radians first. 

Let me calculate θ in radians. θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let's compute that. π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 is about 1.745e-19 radians.

Since θ = size / distance, and the size here is the diameter of the event horizon (because when you look at the angular size, it's the diameter that's subtended), wait no, actually, wait. The event horizon's angular size is the angle subtended by its radius, because the event horizon is a sphere. Or
