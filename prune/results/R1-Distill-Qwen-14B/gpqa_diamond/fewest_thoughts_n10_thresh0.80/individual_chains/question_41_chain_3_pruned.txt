Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in different media, the index of refraction comes into play. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. So the speed of light inside the glass should be c/n, but since c is given as 1 here, it's just 1/n. But wait, that's the speed in the glass when the glass is stationary. What happens when the glass is moving?

Oh, right, this is a relativity problem. Since the glass is moving, we have to consider how velocities transform between different reference frames. Like, the glass's frame and the lab frame. Because the light is moving at speed 1/n in the glass, but the glass itself is moving at velocity v towards the observer.

Wait, but in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light beam? I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But in this case, c is 1
