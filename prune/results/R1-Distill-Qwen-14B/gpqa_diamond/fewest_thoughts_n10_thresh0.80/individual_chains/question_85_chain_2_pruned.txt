Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The question mentions something about the Doppler shift from each planet on the [OI] forbidden line. Planet1 causes a shift up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. But wait, I'm not sure how this relates to equilibrium temperature. Maybe I can ignore that part for now because the question is about the temperature ratio, which depends on other factors.

The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are given, so I need to figure out how to calculate this.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (epsilon) )^(1/4 )

But wait, the planets have the same albedo, so that term cancels out. And since they're both orbiting the same star, the albedo is the same for both, so the ratio of their temperatures would depend on other factors, like their distance from the star (a) and their own properties.

Wait, but the question doesn't give the orbital distances. Oh, wait, but the Doppler shift information might be related to the mass and the orbital period or velocity. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Doppler shifts relate to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

Radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v * (M_planet sin i)) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3)) )
