Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles colliding in a detector. Hmm, let's see what it says. So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector, and new particles are produced. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls? The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, okay, so I think this has to do with the particles' speed and how far they can travel before decaying. Because if they're produced in the center, the maximum distance they can go is the radius of the detector. So, the faster they are, the more likely they are to reach the walls before decaying.

I remember that the proper lifetime of a particle is gamma times the lab frame lifetime. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So from the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma. So tau = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

So the particles have a certain lifetime, and if they're moving fast enough, they can travel the radius of the detector before decaying. The fraction that makes it to the walls depends on how much their lifetime allows them to move that distance.

The problem says that with a Lorentz factor of ~20, on average one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma that results in two-thirds reaching the walls.

Wait, the fraction that reach the walls probably depends on their speed. Because if they're moving at speed v, the time they have to reach the wall is related to their lifetime. So the time it takes to reach the wall is the distance divided by their speed, right? The distance is 30 meters. So time t = 30 / v.

But their lifetime is gamma * tau_0. So if t is less than tau, the particle can reach the wall. Wait, but wait, no. Because if the lifetime is longer than the time to reach the wall, the particle will reach the wall before decaying. So the probability that they reach the wall is proportional to the time they survive compared to the time it takes to reach the wall.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to model the decay as an exponential process. The number of particles that decay before time t is N(t) = N0 (1 - e^(-t/tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime. So the ones that reach the wall are those that live longer than t. The probability that a particle reaches the wall is e^(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The lifetime tau = gamma tau_0. So t is the time it takes to reach the detector wall. v is their velocity. So t = 30 / v. If the particle's lifetime is longer than t, it will reach the wall. So the fraction that reach the wall is the probability that tau > t. That is, the fraction is e^(-t/tau) = e^(- (30/(v * gamma tau_0)) / (gamma tau_0)) )? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The proper lifetime is tau_0. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0. So the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. The speed v is approximately c because it's ultra-relativistic. So t â‰ˆ 30 m / c. Then, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

So the fraction that reach the wall is e^(-30/(gamma tau_0 c)).

Wait, but tau_0 is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0. So the survival probability
