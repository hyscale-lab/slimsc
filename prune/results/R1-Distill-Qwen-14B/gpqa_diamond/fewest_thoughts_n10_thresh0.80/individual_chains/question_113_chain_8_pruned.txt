Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to figure out the chemical formula from the given options. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down each of the spectroscopy data points and see what they tell us.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching. Broad peaks around that region are usually from either alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, almost like a smear, but maybe in this case, it's a broad peak. Also, if it's a carbonyl, which is another consideration.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, I'm trying to remember the typical IR regions. The 1700 area is where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) absorb. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a C=C stretch. Wait, or maybe an amide or something else. Alternatively, sometimes a conjugated carbonyl or a C=C double bond might show up around there. Wait, but 1700 is usually more for carbonyls, while 1650 might be C=O in something else, like maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretch, like in an alkene. Oh, but the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so that supports the presence of a double bond. So perhaps the 1650 is the C=C stretching. But then why is the 1700 peak also there? That would imply another carbonyl group, maybe an ester or a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, but wait, I need to think about possible functional groups. If there's a broad O-H peak, that suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's an alcohol, then maybe an ester is present, which would explain the 1700 cm^-1. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, but then it typically absorbs at a lower wavenumber, like around 2500-3300, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, no, carboxylic acids do have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but maybe the peak at 3000 could be that. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. Hmm.

So, if there's a carbonyl group, that points towards an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid. But if the O-H is present, perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group? Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol?

Wait, but let's not get stuck here. Let's move on to the NMR. The NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons attached to a double bond. So that tells me that the molecule has a double bond, like an alkene. So that's one structure featureâ€” an alkene.

Now, what about the Mass Spectrometry? The fragment peak at m/z=45. 45 is a significant mass. Let me think about what fragments have that. The most common fragment at 45 would be a CH3CO+ ion (acetate ion, m/z=45). Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O+ or something else. Wait, wait, another possibility is that 45 could be a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, thinking about common
