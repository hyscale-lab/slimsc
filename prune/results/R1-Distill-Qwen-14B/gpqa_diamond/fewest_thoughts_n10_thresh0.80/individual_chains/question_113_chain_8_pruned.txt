Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that an unknown compound has been analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The task is to determine its chemical formula from the given data among the options A to D. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Alright, let's break down the data given for each technique.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad. Hmm, wait, another thought: sometimes an alcohol's O-H stretch is a broad peak around 3300-3500, but if it's very broad and around 3000, maybe it's an -OH group in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine or something else, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. So the presence of a broad peak suggests an -OH group, probably an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But then, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. 

Wait, 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak. That's usually a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a C=C. But wait, the 1650 is a bit lower than typical for a carbonyl. Another possibility is an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, which have peaks around 1600-1650. Alternatively, maybe an ester or amide group, but again, the options don't have amide possibilities. So perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester, and the 1650 might be an aromatic ring's stretching or another carbonyl maybe in a conjugated system.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. The problem states that several peaks were observed, including some corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond, maybe in an aromatic ring or an alkene group. The presence of vinyl protons suggests that the structure has a double bond, so perhaps an aromatic ring, or maybe an isolated double bond.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, I need to think about what fragments would give this mass. The molecular ion would break down into smaller fragments. 45 is an interesting mass; for example, the CH3CO+ ion (acetone fragment) has a mass of 45. Alternatively, maybe a (CH3)2CO+ ion. Wait, acetone's molecular weight is 58 (C=12, H=2, O=16: 3*12 +6*
