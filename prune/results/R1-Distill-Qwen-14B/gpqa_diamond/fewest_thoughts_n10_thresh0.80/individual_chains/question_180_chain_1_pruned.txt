Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again and try to figure out what I need to do. The question is about an isolated system of particles with charge and finding the minimum energy. Alright, let's break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 2e? That's double the elementary charge. Right, e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, so 2e would be about 3.204 x 10^-19 C. But I'll probably need to keep it as 2e for calculations to avoid rounding errors.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm trying to visualize this setup. So, point P is where one charge is fixed, and the other twelve are all at a distance of 2 meters away from it. So each of these twelve is 2 m away from P, but what about their arrangement? Are they all on the same sphere around P, or arranged in some specific way? Well, the problem doesn't specify, so I think I can assume they're all at 2 m from P, but the arrangement might not matter as much for the potential energy calculation because each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Hmm, in terms of electrostatic potential energy, the energy depends on the configuration of the charges. For a system of charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potentials due to each pair. Since the charges are identical and all are the same sign (because each is 2e, so positive if e is considered positive), bringing them closer would increase the potential energy because like charges repel and you have to do work against the repulsion. But wait, the twelve charges are fixed at 2m from P, and the thirteenth is at P. So perhaps the minimum energy is achieved when the twelve are arranged such that the potential energy due to their own interactions is minimized. Or maybe it's about the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others.

Wait, but the problem says the system is isolated, so we have to consider all the interactions. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential
