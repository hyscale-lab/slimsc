Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges.

Hmm, the setup is that there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, the problem says 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

Wait, so the system consists of a central charge and 12 others arranged in some way. But since the 12 are constrained, maybe they form a symmetric arrangement around P. Like a regular dodecahedron or something, but perhaps it's a sphere. But for the energy calculation, the arrangement matters because the potential energy depends on the distances between each pair.

The question is about the minimum energy. Hmm, so I recall that the potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum of the potential energies of each pair. For point charges, the potential energy U between two charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is U = (k q1 q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Since the problem is about the minimum energy of the system, I'm wondering if the arrangement of the 12 charges around P affects the total energy. But wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge is fixed. So each of these 12 is at a distance r = 2 m from the central charge.

Wait, but wait—each of the 12 is 2 meters from P, but what about their distances from each other? Because the potential energy involves all pairs, including the interactions among the 12. So I can't ignore that. But since the charges are identical and the problem doesn't specify their exact arrangement, perhaps the arrangement is such that they're all equally distant from each other
