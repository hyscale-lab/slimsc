Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. So the question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. Hmm, okay, I remember that the wave function needs to be normalized, meaning the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) – 0.5i. Wait, wait. Oh right, the wave function is a complex function, but for normalization, I think we only consider the modulus squared. But wait, how does the imaginary part affect this? Oh, right, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So I need to compute |ψ(x)|², which is ψ*(x) * ψ(x).

But wait, the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) – 0.5i. Let me write that out properly. So ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex number. So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

When I multiply ψ*(x) by ψ(x), I get [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms (the i terms) would cancel out when multiplied. Wait, let's see: (a/s)^2 + (0.5)^2 because the imaginary parts are negative and positive, respectively. So yes, the product is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, because the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, because when you square the modulus, it's (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral ∫ |ψ|^2 dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Wait, but integrating [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3. Let me split that into two integrals: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫1 dx, evaluated from 1 to 3.

Let's compute each part. The first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 times ∫dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together: a² * ln(
