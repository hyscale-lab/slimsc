Okay, so I've got this problem about the elemental abundances in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

First, let's parse the given information. Both stars have masses that are more than our Sun—1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if their masses directly affect the solution. Maybe the question is more about the element ratios, so perhaps the mass isn't super crucial here. I'll keep that in mind.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method under LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. 

So, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex. Wait, [Fe/H] is a notation where H is the reference. So [Fe/H] equals 0 means that the Fe abundance is the same as in the Sun. So Star_1's Fe is solar. 

For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. So Mg to Si ratio is higher than solar by 10^0.3. Also, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, which means Mg abundance in Star_2 is the same as the Sun. 

The Sun's photosphere has specific values for the abundances: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5. 

Wait, but I think I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, the question is asking for (nSi_1 / nSi_2). 

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Find the abundance ratios of Si relative to Fe and Mg relative to Si for each star.
2. Use the Sun's abundances to find the actual abundances in each star.
3. Compute the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Wait, let me think about each step.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. This is log(Si/Fe) = 0.3. So Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So in Star_1, the
