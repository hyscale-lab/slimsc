Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by some high scale, probably the Planck scale or something like that. These operators are classified by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Oh wait, and the choices are combinations of these.

So let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I know that the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT operators are built from the SM fields, so they should also respect Lorentz invariance. So each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. So yes, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it consists of rotations, boosts, translations. But wait, in the SMEFT framework, the operators are local, meaning they don't have non-local terms. So the effective operators should respect local Lorentz symmetry and also translation invariance. Wait, but when you write down the SMEFT Lagrangian, it's a Lorentz-invariant local theory. So operators must be Poincare invariant as well. Or wait, is Poincare symmetry automatically included if the theory is Lorentz invariant and translation invariant? Hmm. Because Lorentz transformations include boosts and rotations, and translations are separate. So I think the operators must be local, meaning they have to respect Poincare symmetry. So yes, 2 is necessary.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. SMEFT is a low-energy effective field theory, which by definition respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the SM includes Poincare symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators must respect all the SM symmetries, including Poincare. So 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: I'm not so sure about this. The Standard Model doesn't have a global CP symmetry except for certain cases. Wait, the SM has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So for the operators in SMEFT, do they need to respect CP symmetry? Or can they have CP-violating terms?

I think the operators can include terms that violate CP. Because the effective theory is just a way to parameterize beyond the SM effects, which could include CP violation. So the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must. So option C) includes 3 and 4, but if 3 isn't required, then maybe not.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, arising from the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, so SMEFT operators must also respect this. Because if they didn't, they would introduce CPT violation, which is a big deal, as it's required by the axioms of QFT. So all operators must preserve CPT symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Are there any CPT-violating terms in SMEFT? I think the SMEFT is based
