Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question involves the rotation-vibration model, right? Let me think about what I know.

So the molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. 

Wait, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels come from both rotational and vibrational states. But when considering the fundamental state, it's the lowest vibrational state, and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1? I'm a bit fuzzy on that).

Wait, no. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, which is the ground vibrational state with the lowest rotational state. So for a diatomic, the ground state would be the vibrational ground state (n=0) and the rotational ground state (J=0 or J=1? I think for the rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but wait, the question is about the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, I think the non-rigid rotor is the same as the rotation-vibration model that allows for bond length changes, but the main point is the energy transitions.

Wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state after the fundamental (lowest) state would be either an increase in vibrational state (n=1) or an increase in rotational state (J=1). But which requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps it's the smallest possible energy increase. So I need to find the smallest possible photon energy that would cause a transition.

So I think I need to calculate the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions and see which is smaller.

Wait, but what's the fundamental state in terms of J and n? The fundamental state is n=0, and the lowest J, which is J=0. So the next possible state could be either n=1 and J=0, or n=0 and J=1. But which transition is lower in energy?

Alternatively, maybe the next state is the lowest possible, which could involve a combination of both. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the energy levels.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J (J+1) ℏ² )/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The moment of inertia I is μ R², with μ being the reduced mass. So I need to calculate the energy differences for both possible transitions.

First, let's compute the energy difference for a vibrational transition. Going from n=0 to n=1. The energy change ΔE_vib = E(1) - E(0) = [ (1 + 1/2) - (0 + 1/2) ] h w = h w. So that's h times 4e14 rad/s. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s.

Then, the energy for a rotational transition. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = [ J (J+1) ] * (ℏ²)/(2I), but ℏ is h/(2π). Wait, E_rot can be written as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ℏ²/(2I). Alternatively, B = h/(8 π² c I), but maybe I'm mixing up the units here. Wait, perhaps another approach: the moment of inertia I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So, let's compute the reduced mass μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. The reduced mass is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) in amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, 20/11 is approximately 1.818. But wait, 20+2=22, yes.

Now, converting μ from amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ ~3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 1.818 * 1.6605 is roughly 1.8 * 1.66 is approx 2.988. So 2.988e-27 kg. Hmm, close enough.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So the moment of inertia I is μ R² = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

Now the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * (ℏ²)/(2I). Let's compute the energy difference between J=0 and J=1. So for J=0, E0=0. For J=1, E1= (1*2) * (ℏ²)/(2I) = 2*(ℏ²)/(2I) = (ℏ²)/I.

So ΔE_rot = E1 - E0 = (ℏ²)/(I) where ℏ is h/(2π). So ℏ² is h²/(4π²).

So ΔE_rot = (h²/(4 π² I)).

Wait, what's the value of that? Let's plug in the numbers.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

Compute h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

4 π² is about 39.478.

So h²/(4 π² I) = (4.39e-67) / (39.478 *1.2064e-46) )

Compute denominator: 39.478 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.63e-46 = 4.763e-45.

So 4.39e-67 / 4.763e-45 ≈ approx 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but that's about 9e-23 J. Let's compare with the vibrational energy difference.

The vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is h w = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

So ΔE_vib is about 2.65e-19 J, which is much larger than ΔE_rot's 9e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational one.

Therefore, the smallest possible energy increase is the rotational one, so the photon should have energy matching the ΔE_rot.

So the photon's energy should be E_photon = ΔE_rot.

But the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Oh right, photons have energy E = p c, where p is momentum, and c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

Wait, E_photon = h w is the vibrational transition, but wait, no, we're considering the rotational transition. So E_photon is 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but let me recalculate this properly because I might have messed up some steps.

Wait, going back: E_rot for J=1 is 2 B, where B is the rotational constant in energy units. And B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I c), but wait, I think I might have confused some formulas. Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B = (h^2)/(8 π² I c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is defined as (ℏ²)/(2I), so E_J = B J (J+1).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (J (J+1) ) * (ħ²)/(2I), where ħ is h/(2π), and I is the moment of inertia.

So, for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = (1*2) * (ħ²)/(2I) ) = (2 * (h^2/(4 π²)) )/(2I) ) = (h²/(2 π² I)) ). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E= (h²)/(2 π² I).

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So yes, ΔE_rot = (h²)/(2 π² I).

Wait, let me compute that correctly.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.390e-67 (J·s)^2.

I is 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

So 2 π² I = 2*(9.8696) *1.2064e-46 ≈ 2*9.8696=19.7392; 19.7392 *1.2064e-46 ≈ 23.82e-46 = 2.382e-45.

Wait, no, 19.7392 * 1.2064e-46 = let me compute 19.7392 * 1.2064:

19.7392 *1.2064 ≈ roughly 23.82, so 23.82e-46 = 2.382e-45.

So ΔE_rot = (4.390e-67) / (2.382e-45) ) = (4.390 / 2.382) ) * 1e-22 ≈ 1.84e-22 J.

Wait, that's approximately 1.84e-22 J. Hmm, that's different from what I had before. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me do it correctly.

Calculating denominator: 2 π² I = 2 * (pi^2) * I.

pi^2 is approx 9.8696. So 2 *9.8696=19.7392.

So 19.7392 * I (which is 1.2064e-46 kg·m²) = 19.7392 *1.2064e-46 = 23.816e-46 = 2.3816e-45.

So ΔE_rot = 4.390e-67 / 2.3816e-45 = (4.390 / 2.3816 ) * 1e-22.

4.390 / 2.3816 ≈ 1.843.

So ΔE_rot ≈ 1.843e-22 J.

Now, the energy of the photon should be equal to this, since the molecule is absorbing a photon to transition from J=0 to J=1.

So E_photon = 1.843e-22 J.

Now, the momentum p of the photon is given by E = p c, so p = E / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 1.843e-22 J / 3e8 m/s = 6.143e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are on the order of 1e-27 or 1e-28 N·s. Wait, kg·m/s is the same as N·s because 1 N = 1 kg·m/s², so 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

So 6.143e-31 kg·m/s is 6.14e-31 N·s. But none of the options are that small.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait. Let's compute I again. The reduced mass μ is (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) = (40)/(22) amu = 1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.81818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 = approximately 3.016. So 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

So that's correct.

Now, E_rot for J=1 is (1*2)* (ħ²)/(2I) = 2*( (h/(2π))² )/(2I) ) = 2*( h²/(4 π²) )/(2I) ) = ( h² )/(4 π² I ) ).

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct expression is E = (J(J+1) ) * (ħ^2)/(2I) ) = J(J+1) * (h²)/(8 π² I) ).

Wait, because ħ = h/(2 π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π^2). So E_J = (J (J+1) ) * (h²/(4 π² )) / (2I) ) = (J (J+1) h² )/(8 π² I) ).

So for J=1, E = 2 * h²/(8 π² I) ) = h²/(4 π² I).

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the energy difference.

So ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = h²/(4 π² I).

So ΔE_rot = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 * pi^2 * 1.2064e-46 kg·m² )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.390e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 4 * pi^2 * 1.2064e-46.

4 * pi² ≈ 39.478.

39.478 * 1.2064e-46 = 47.62e-46 = 4.762e-45.

So ΔE_rot = 4.390e-67 / 4.762e-45 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, that's 9.22e-23 J. Now, photon energy E = 9.22e-23 J.

Then, p = E / c = (9.22e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.073e-31 kg·m/s = 3.073e-31 N·s.

But the options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Wait, 3e-31 is way smaller than the options. So this must mean I made a mistake in choosing which transition is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the vibrational ground state with the rotational state at J=1, and the next state is J=2? No, because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so probably the next state is the first possible higher state, which could be either J=1 or n=1.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the combination of vibrational and rotational transitions. But the problem is in the fundamental state, which is n=0, J=0. The next state could be n=1, J=0 (vibrational excitation) or n=0, J=1 (rotational excitation). The one with the lower energy transition would be the rotational,
