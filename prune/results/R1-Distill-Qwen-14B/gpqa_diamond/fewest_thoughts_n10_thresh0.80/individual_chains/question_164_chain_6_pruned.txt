Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm kinda new to this, but let's try to work through it. Hmm, binary star systems... right, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass. The question is about comparing the masses of two systems, system_1 and system_2.

The problem says both systems exhibit eclipses, and the periods are given: system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Wait, the period refers to the time between two primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system. So the orbital period is the time it takes for both stars to orbit around their common center of mass once.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. In system_1, the stars have RV variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. Radial velocity amplitude refers to the maximum speed at which each star moves towards or away from us, right?

I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so its RV amplitude is smaller. Because the less massive star has to move more to keep the system balanced. So the star with the larger RV amplitude is the less massive one.

The mass ratio comes into play here. Let me think, the mass of each star is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitude. Because if star A has a mass m1 and velocity v1, and star B has mass m2 and velocity v2, then m1/m2 = v2/v1. Because the center of mass requires m1*v1 = m2*v2. So the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses.

Wait, so in system_1, the two stars have RVs 10 and 5. So their mass ratio would be 5/10, which is 1/2. So m1/m2= (v2)/(v1) = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half the mass of m2. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Star A has velocity v1, star B has v2. Then m1 * v1 = m2 * v2, so m1/m2 = v2/v1. So if v1 is 10 and v2 is 5, then m1/m2=5/10=0.5. So m1 is half of m2. So the mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = m2*(0.5 + 1) = 1.5 m2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, system_1: star A has velocity 10, star B 5. So m1 = (v2/v1) * m2. So m1 = (5/10) m2 = 0.5 m2. So the total mass of system_1 is 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly for system_2: their RVs are 15 and 10. So m1' = (10/15) m2
