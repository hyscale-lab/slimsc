Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions from the given options.

Let me start by breaking down the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Looking at their positions, the numbering is probably such that the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, wait, no: the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So it's a meta arrangement for the ethoxy and nitro groups, but with the tert-butyl in the adjacent position.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so the positions can be looked at in terms of their relative positions. Let me imagine the ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of directing groups and the order of substitution.

I remember that substituents on benzene can be activating or deactivating and can direct incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions. So the order in which the substituents are added will determine the positions.

So, benzene is the starting material. We need to add three groups: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Let's think about how each group is introduced and the directing effects.

Nitration (adding nitro group) is typically done with HNO3 in H2SO4. Nitro is a strong meta director. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para director because it's an electron-donating group (OCH2CH3). The tert-butyl group is a bulky substituent; it's a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it's an
