Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Astronomers are looking at a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, what do I remember about this? Oh right, this probably relates to the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the number of particles in different levels changes with temperature.

The Boltzmann equation in terms of number ratio is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is decreasing when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots. The ratio is n1/n2, I think. So when the temperature drops, what happens to this ratio?

Let me think: the transition wavelength is 1448 Ã…, which is in the near UV. Titanium lines in stellar spectra are often used as abundance indicators, and the ionization balance can tell us about temperature.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. So the effective temperature is lower when spots are present. But the question is about the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels. 

Wait, but the star's photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so each region emits according to its local temperature. But when spots are present, parts of the surface are cooler
