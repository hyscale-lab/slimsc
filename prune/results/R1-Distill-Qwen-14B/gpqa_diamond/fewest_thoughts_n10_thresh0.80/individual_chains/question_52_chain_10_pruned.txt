Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. So there's a star with certain parameters, and when spots cover part of its surface, the effective temperature changes. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Hmm. Let's break this down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses, but maybe those details aren't directly relevant here. The key things are the effective temperatures and the line formation related to Ti atoms.

When the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. I think this means that the star's average temperature has decreased because spots are cooler and emit less light.

The question focuses on the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio R = N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots. The problem is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes—so (R_no_spots) / (R_with_spots).

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots (Teff=5500K), R is lower. So the factor is (R_without_spots) / (R_with_spots) = factor.

In stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where E_i and E_j are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet, I think. But for the Boltzmann factor, the energy difference ΔE between the two levels is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So the energy difference E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Assuming E2 > E1, so ΔE positive. Then the ratio n1/n2 = exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, no. Let me get the exact equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two states is proportional to exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if level 2 is higher in energy than level 1, then E2 > E1. So the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T), but in the ratio n1/n2, it's exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T)).

Wait, correct formula: n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight. But in this problem, maybe the statistical weights are the same or not given, so perhaps we can ignore them for this ratio, or assume they're equal. So the ratio n1/n2 = exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = exp(-ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

But in this case, the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the Teff decreases, the ratio R = n1/n2 decreases. So when Teff is lower, R is lower.

Wait, but according to the formula, if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So R decreases when T decreases. That's consistent with the problem statement.

So when the star has spots, T_eff is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K.

So R = n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

We can write
