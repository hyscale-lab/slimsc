Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, the question says that a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on the VLT. I remember that the VLT is in Chile, at the Paranal Observatory. So the location might affect the visibility of the stars, but I don't know if that's relevant here. The question probably assumes that the stars are observable, so maybe I don't have to worry about that.

Wait, but some of the options give the star's RA and DEC as 0,0. RA 0 is right at the intersection of right ascension 0 and declination 0. So that's the point where the celestial equator and the prime meridian meet. Depending on the observatory's latitude, some stars might not be visible. But Paranal is at a high southern latitude, I think. Let me recall: Paranal is in the Atacama desert, southern hemisphere. So declination 0 is on the celestial equator, which should be visible from Paranal. So all these stars should be visible at some point. So maybe RA and DEC don't affect detectability here beyond that, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can ignore that for now.

The main factor is the S/N ratio. I think the S/N depends on the brightness of the star. So I need to calculate or compare the V magnitudes. Let me see the options again.

Option a) Canopus. I know that Canopus is one of the brightest stars, probably a V magnitude of around 0.7 or something. So very bright.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, I think it's about magnitude 2, maybe a bit brighter. Wait, no, I think it's about 2. Maybe a bit lower. Wait, no, I think it's around 2. But I'm not certain. Let me double-check: I think Polaris is about magnitude 2. So that's moderately bright.

Options c, d, e, f: All these stars have an absolute V magnitude of 15, but different distances. So their apparent magnitudes will vary based on distance.

Wait, absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude they would have at 10 parsecs distance. So for each, the apparent magnitude can be calculated with the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So let's calculate the apparent magnitude for each of these.

Option c: 10 pc. So d=10, so log10(10/10)=0. So m = 15 + 0 =15. That's very faint.

Option e: 5 pc. So d=5. d/10 = 0.5. log10(0.5)= -0.3010. So m=15 + 5*(-0.3010) = 15 -1.505 =13.495. So about 13.5.

Option f:50 pc. d=50. d/10=5. log10(5)=0.69897. So m=15 +5*0.69897 â‰ˆ15 +3.495=18.495.

Option d:200 pc. d=200. d/10=20. log10(20)=1.3010. So m=15 +5*1.3010=15+6.505=21.505. That's super faint.

So the apparent magnitudes:

a) Canopus: ~0.7 (very bright)
b) Polaris: ~2 (moderately bright)
c) 15 (extremely faint)
d)21.5 (extremely faint)
e)13.5
f)18.5

Now, the ESPRESSO spectrograph's performance depends on the brightness of the star. I need to find out what the S/N per binned pixel would be for each star. The question says S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

I think the S/N ratio is influenced by the star's flux, which is a function of its apparent magnitude. Brighter stars yield higher S/N. The formula for S/N ratio depends on exposure time, flux from the star, and noise sources (like background, readout, etc.), but I'm not exactly sure about the formula.

Wait, I remember that the signal-to-noise ratio for a star can be approximated by a formula that depends on the star's magnitude, exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. For spectroscopy, it's a bit more complicated, but maybe for this question, we can consider that higher apparent magnitude (fainter) stars will have lower S/N.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph is designed for high-resolution spectroscopy, so it's optimized for bright stars, I think. But I'm not sure about the exact magnitude limit.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the relation between apparent magnitude and S/N per pixel for ESPRESSO. Let me think: I think that for a given exposure time, the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time. Since the exposure is 1 hour
