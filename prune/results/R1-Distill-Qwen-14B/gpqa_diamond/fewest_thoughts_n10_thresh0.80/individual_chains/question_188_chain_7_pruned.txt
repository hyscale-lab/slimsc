Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography and interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes of atoms. The formula for interplanar distance depends on the type of crystal structure.

Wait, the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been skewed. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, but wait, does that refer to the edge length 'a' of the unit cell? I think so because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the edge length. So a=10 Angstroms here.

The angles are all 30 degrees. So alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees. That's important because the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral systems uses the angles.

The question is about the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h² sin² α + k² sin² β + l² sin² γ)/(a² sin² α) Hmm, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe the formula for rhombohedral systems is similar to hexagonal or something else. Let me think.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos γ) ) )

But wait, for a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma = θ. So in this case, θ is 30 degrees. So cos(alpha) = cos(30°) which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the formula simplifies to:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosθ - 2hl cosθ - 2kl cosθ )

Since it's the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.
