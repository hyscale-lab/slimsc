Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about two planets orbiting a star. Both planets have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, a radius of 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is a bit smaller: 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The question mentions some effects on the [OI] forbidden line. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. But I'm not sure how that's relevant yet. Wait, maybe it's about the Doppler shift due to their orbits affecting the star's spectrum. Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move.

But the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets. The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is what we're after. And they have the same albedo. So albedo is the reflectivity; same means the same fraction of light is reflected. 

Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the distance of the planet from the star, and the planet's own reflectivity (albedo). The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, actually, the equilibrium temperature equation is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( ( R_star^2 ) / ( (1 - albedo) * a^2 ) ) )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( ( R_star ) / ( 2 * a ) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(-1/4) )

Wait, maybe a better approach: The equilibrium temperature is determined by the energy balance. The planet absorbs energy from the star and radiates as a blackbody. The formula is:

T_eq = T_star * ( ( L_star / (16 * π^2 * σ * a^2) ) )^(1/4)

Wait, perhaps a different approach. The star
