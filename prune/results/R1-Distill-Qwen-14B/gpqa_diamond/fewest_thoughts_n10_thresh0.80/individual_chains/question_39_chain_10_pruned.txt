Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We've got a large number of identical systems—like 10,000 particles. Each particle has the same wave function described as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position of these particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Hmm, right. Remember, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. One of the main ones is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That looks a bit odd. Oh wait, wait a second. Maybe I'm misinterpreting this. The wave function is given as a function of x. Let me write it down properly.

The wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So it's a complex function. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, that can't be right. Because usually, the wave function is a function that can be written as a sum of real and imaginary parts. But in this case, the real part is a function of x, and the imaginary part is a constant. That seems a bit unusual, but maybe it's correct. Let's think about it.

Wait, but for a stationary state, the wave function is typically written as ψ(x) = A e^{i...} or something similar, but in this case, perhaps it's a standing wave or some other form.

But regardless, the probability density is given by |ψ(x)|². So I should compute that. Let me compute |ψ(x)|².

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i.

So the absolute square is [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

So |ψ(x)|² =
