Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting zero. The system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, right? Because the probabilities must add up to one. Oh wait, maybe I should check that first. Because if the vector isn't normalized, I'll have to normalize it before proceeding.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me calculate the norm squared. That's (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So I need to divide each component by sqrt(6) to get the normalized state. So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Next, the observable P is given. It's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

Wait, I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (the possible measurement outcomes) are real. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Looking at the elements:

First row: [0, 1/√2, 0]. The third column of the first row is 0, and the first column of the third row is 0, so that's symmetric. The second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]. The first element is 1/√2, which should match the (1,2) element. The third element in second row is 1/√2, which should match the (3,2) element. So yeah, P looks Hermitian because it's symmetric and all elements are real. So that's good, P is a valid observable.

Now, the problem is to find the probability of measuring 0 when P is measured. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P, find which eigenvalue is 0, and then find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue. Then, project the state |ψ> onto that eigenvector to find the probability amplitude, and square it to get the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way. I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated using <ψ| P |ψ>, but that gives the average value. But here, we need the probability of a specific outcome, which is 0.

Wait, but maybe the matrix P has 0 as one of its eigenvalues. Let me find the eigenvalues of P. Because the probability of measuring 0 is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenvector(s) corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

[ 0          1/√2       0        ]
[1/√2       0          1/√2     ]
[ 0          1/√2       0        ]

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to guess the eigenvectors. Let me think about possible eigenvectors.

Looking at the structure: The first and third rows are similar. Let's try to find eigenvectors.

Suppose an eigenvector v is [a, b, a]^T, because looking at the first row: 0*a + (1/√2)*b +0*c = eigenvalue * a. Wait, but if I assume v is symmetric, like [a, b, a], then when I multiply by P, I can see what happens.

Wait, maybe
