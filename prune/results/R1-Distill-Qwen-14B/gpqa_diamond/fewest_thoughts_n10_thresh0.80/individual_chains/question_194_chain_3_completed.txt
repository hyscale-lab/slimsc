Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about partition functions. Hmm... Let's see, the question is about three spins S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each state corresponds to a particular configuration of the spins. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. So I need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states and sum up the exponentials.

But calculating each one manually could be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the system. Each spin variable is ±1, so S_i S_j is 1 if S_i and S_j are the same, and -1 if they're different. So the term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be expressed as the sum of the products of each pair.

Let me denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So each term in H is ±1. Then the energy E is -J times H. So E = -J*(H), where H is the sum.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all possible spin configurations (each S_i = ±1) of exp(β J H), because E = -J H, so exp(-β E) = exp(β J H).

Wait, that makes sense. So Z = sum_{all S} exp(β J H), where H is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

But maybe I can find the possible values of H and how many configurations give each H. That way, I can group the terms and compute Z more efficiently.

So, let's find all possible values of H. Since each term in H is ±1, the sum can be... Let me think. The maximum H occurs when all pairwise products are +1, which would be when all spins are the same. Then H = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. The minimum would be when all are -1, so H = (-1)*3 = -3. But wait, that's not the case; let me check. If two spins are +1 and one is -1, how does H change?

Wait, perhaps it's better to count how many states give each possible H. Let me list all possible H values and the number of states that lead to that H.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of pairs that are aligned. Let me consider that each spin must agree or disagree with the others. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to enumerate all possible cases.

Wait, but that's 8 states, which isn't too bad. Let me list them.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so the possible combinations are:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1+1+1=3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1= -1.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1= -1.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1= -1.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1= -1.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1= -1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 -1 -1= -1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1+1+1=3.

Wait, so in this case, when all spins are +1 or all are -1, H is 3. For all other cases (which are 6 states), H is -1. So H can take two possible values: 3 and -1. 

So, for H=3, there are 2 states (all +1 and all -1). For H=-1, there are 6 states. 

Now, the partition function is Z = sum [exp(β J H)] for each state. But since multiple states have the same H, we can group them.

So, Z = (Number of states where H=3) * exp(β J *3) + (Number of states where H=-1) * exp(β J * (-1)).

So, Z = 2 * exp(3 β J) + 6 * exp( - β J ). 

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ)
Option B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ)
Option C) ... etc.

So according to my calculation, Z is 2 e^{3 β J} +6 e^{-β J}, which would be option B.

But wait, let me double-check. Each state contributes exp(β J H), right?

Yes. Because E = -J H, so exp(-β E) = exp(β J H). So, correct.

So the partition function is 2 e^{3β J} +6 e^{-β J}. That's option B.


To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(-\beta E),
\]
where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Substituting \( E = -JH \) (with \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \)), the partition function becomes:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(\beta J H).
\]

### Step 1: Determine the possible values of \( H \)
Each spin \( S_i \) can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so \( S_iS_j \) is \( +1 \) if \( S_i = S_j \) and \( -1 \) if \( S_i \neq S_j \). The sum \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can therefore take the following values:
- \( H = 3 \): All spins are aligned (either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)).
- \( H = -1 \): Two spins are aligned, and one is opposite.

### Step 2: Count the number of states for each \( H \)
- For \( H = 3 \), there are 2 states: all spins \( +1 \) or all spins \( -1 \).
- For \( H = -1 \), there are 6 states: any configuration where two spins are aligned, and one is opposite.

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum over all states of \( \exp(\beta J H) \). Grouping states by \( H \), we get:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3\beta J) + 6 \exp(-\beta J).
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 e^{-3J\beta} + 6 e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 e^{2J\beta} + 6 e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect coefficients).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 e^{2J\beta} + 2 e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect coefficients and signs).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
