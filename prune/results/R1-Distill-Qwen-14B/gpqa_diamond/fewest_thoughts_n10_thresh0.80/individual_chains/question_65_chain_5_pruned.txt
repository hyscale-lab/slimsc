Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I'll match them with the options provided.

First, Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, potassium hydride (KH), and then H+. I'm not exactly sure what's happening here. Let me think about each part.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol would have a five-membered ring and a seven-membered ring (since 3 + 5 + 1 = 9, but wait, the non indicates nine carbons. Hmm, maybe the spiro is between a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring? Or perhaps another configuration. Wait, no, the [3.5] part means two rings connected at one carbon: one is a 3-membered ring (so a cyclopropane) and the other a 5-membered ring, like cyclopentane. So the spiro is at carbon 1, which has a vinyl group (CH2CH2) attached as well. Wait, no, 1-vinyl would be a CH2CH2 group attached to the spiro carbon. So the structure is a spiro with a cyclopropane ring and a cyclopentane ring, both connected at C1, which also has a vinyl group (CH2CH2).

Reaction conditions: THF is a solvent, which is usually used for Grignard reactions or in organometallic reactions. KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. Then H+ is added, which probably protonates something after the base has done its job.

So, what's happening here? Maybe a elimination or a ring-forming reaction. Since the starting material has a spiro structure, perhaps an elimination leads to a bicyclic compound. Alternatively, maybe a conjugate addition or some sort of cyclopropane opening.

Wait, another thought: when a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, it can undergo elimination to form a new ring. For example, the spiro alcohol could lose a water molecule, forming a double bond and creating a bridge, thus forming a bicyclic compound.

So the starting material is 1-vinylspiro... So, the OH is on the spiro carbon (C1). When treated with a strong base like KH, which is a deprotonating agent, it could deprotonate the spiro alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs, leading to the formation of a new double bond, thereby creating a bridge. Let me think about the structure.

The molecule is 1-vinyl, meaning on the spiro carbon (C1), there's a CH2-CH2 group.
