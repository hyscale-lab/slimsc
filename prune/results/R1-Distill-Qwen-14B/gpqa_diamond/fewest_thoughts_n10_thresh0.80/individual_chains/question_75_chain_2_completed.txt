Okay, so I've got this question about creating a transgenic mouse model and some issues with protein overexpression. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that someone is trying to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They created a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress GADD45G. To do this, they modified the gene's coding sequence by adding a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Then, they transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The problem is that the sequence of the plus strand of their construct is provided, and they noticed something wrong. The options give possible explanations.

Looking at the sequence, I need to check if there's any issue that would prevent the correct expression of the protein. Let's think about each option.

Option A says the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That would mean a wrong amino acid is present, potentially disrupting the protein's function. But the question is about overexpression, not function. So maybe that's not the main issue here.

Option B suggests the ribosome stopped translating early. How? That would happen if there's a premature stop codon. Let me look for a stop codon in the provided sequence. The coding sequence starts with ATG (which is the start codon), and then continues. I need to see if there's a TAA, TAG, or TGA anywhere that would act as a stop.

Looking through the sequence, let's scan for those triplets. Hmm, let's see. The sequence is long, but maybe there's a stop codon early on. Let me look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA. The end of the sequence is ... GAGTGA3'. Wait, the last part before the end is 'TGA'. Oh, wait, but that's at the very end. Let me see: The last part is TGA3'. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop. But wait, the correct reading frame needs to be considered.

Wait, the sequence given is the plus strand, which is the coding strand. So the mRNA would be complementary to this. Wait no, the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T for U. So the start is ATG, and the end is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the construct has a stop codon at the end, which is correct. So the ribosome would stop there, which is normal. So that shouldn't be the issue. So option B might not be correct because the stop codon is at the end, not early. Unless there's another stop codon earlier.

Wait, maybe I should check the entire sequence for other stop codons. Let me look. Let's see:

Looking for TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking through, for example:

After ATG, the next codon is TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), then TAC (tyrosine), etc. Hmm, later on, I see GATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. 

I see TGA right at the end, and looking elsewhere, perhaps in the middle:

Looking for TGA, maybe in the middle? Let me check:

Looking at the beginning, after ATG, the codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, etc. Hmm, not seeing any TGA. Then, looking through, perhaps at GGCTGCGAGAAC..., wait, TGA is the very last triplet.

So the only stop codon is at the very end. So the construct seems correctly terminated. So why wouldn't the protein be expressed?

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. So the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. If the linker between HA and GADD45G is missing, maybe the protein is being recognized by proteases. Or perhaps the HA tag isn't being properly expressed. Alternatively, maybe the ribosome binding site is missing or incorrect, causing the mRNA not to be translated. But wait, the issue is overexpression—so if the construct isn't expressed, perhaps the problem is with the expression vector or the presence of a stop codon elsewhere.

Wait, but the given construct is the coding sequence with the HA tag. If the HA sequence is present but without a proper linker, maybe the HA is being cleaved or the protein is unstable. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to misfold, but that's more about function, not expression.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But in this construct, the stop codon is TGA, not UAA. Because in DNA, the stop codon would be TGA. So if in the mRNA, this translates to UAC (since DNA is T becomes U). Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the DNA is TGA on the plus strand. The mRNA is complementary, so it would be UAC? No, wait: The coding strand is the same as mRNA but with T instead of U. So the DNA sequence is TGA, which in mRNA would be UAC. Wait, no: the mRNA is complementary to the DNA non-coding strand. Let me think again. Suppose the DNA (coding strand) is 5' ATG... TGA 3'. The mRNA is made from the template (non-coding) strand, which would be complementary. So the non-coding strand would be 3' ... CAT ... 5', so the mRNA would be 5' ATG ... AUC ... 3' (since DNA non-coding is CAT, mRNA is AUG). Wait, no: the coding strand is the same as mRNA, but T instead of U. So, for the coding strand, the DNA is TGA, so the mRNA would have UAC? No, wait: if the coding strand is TGA, the template is CAT, so the mRNA would be AUG.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think carefully. The DNA coding strand is the same as the mRNA, except T for U. So for a DNA sequence of TGA on the coding strand, the mRNA would have UAC. Because the mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) DNA strand, which is complementary to the coding strand. So, if the coding DNA is TGA, the template is CAT, so the mRNA is AUG? No, wait:

Ah, no, wait. Let's imagine the coding DNA strand is 5' TGA 3'. The template strand is 3' CAT 5'. So when mRNA is made from the template, it's 5' AUG 3'. So the mRNA codon is AUG, which is a start, not a stop. Wait, no, that's not possible because TGA is a stop in DNA. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another approach: in mRNA, the stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. So if the DNA coding strand has TGA, the mRNA would have UGA. Because the DNA's TGA is on the coding strand, the mRNA is made from the template, so it's complementary. So DNA coding is TGA, so template is CAT, so mRNA is AUG? No, wait, DNA is TGA (coding strand). The mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) strand, which is complementary. So DNA template is CAT, so mRNA is AUG. But AUG is a start codon, not a stop. So wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the provided DNA sequence is the coding (sense) strand, and the mRNA is the same as that, with T replaced by U. So the DNA sequence is TGA, which would translate to UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. Oh! Because DNA is TGA, so mRNA is UGA. So the mRNA would have a UGA codon, which is a stop. So in the DNA, the construct ends with TGA, which in mRNA is UGA—a stop codon. So that's a problem because the ribosome would stop there.

Wait, but wait, the DNA is the coding strand, so in the mRNA, the sequence would be the same as the coding DNA but with T's replaced by U's. So the last part of the DNA is TGA, which in mRNA becomes UGA. UGA is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have a stop codon at the end, which is correct. So the ribosome would terminate there. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, but without a proper ribosome binding site. Or perhaps the HA tag is leading to a frame shift or a premature stop codon upstream.

Wait, looking at the sequence again. The HA tag is a single determinant, which is a short peptide. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes the HA sequence. Okay, but perhaps the HA sequence introduces a stop codon before the end.

Wait, the start is ATG, so the first codon is methionine. The next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), etc. So the HA tag is probably at the beginning, before the GADD45G coding sequence. So the HA would add a few amino acids before the GADD45G starts.

But the problem is that the entire protein isn't being expressed. So maybe there’s an issue with the HA tag causing a premature stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. How?

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, let me write the initial part:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, wait. Let me write the codons:

ATG (start)

TAC (Y)

CCA (P)

TAC (Y)

GAT (D)

GTT (V)

CCA (P)

GAT (D)

TAC (Y)

GCC (A)

AAA (K)

TGA (stop)

Wait a minute! So the DNA sequence after the initial ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA. Translating this, the codons are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.

Wait, but wait, wait.

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.

So the first codon is ATG (start). Then TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (aspartic acid), TAC (tyrosine), GCC (alanine), AAA (lysine), TGA (stop).

But wait, TGA is a stop codon. So the HA tag is perhaps introducing a stop codon after a few amino acids. Because after the HA tag, there should be the GADD45G coding sequence, but in this case, the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, which would truncate the protein.

Oh! So the HA tag is added, but the construct's coding sequence ends prematurely because the HA's sequence includes a stop codon. Wait, but the HA tag is just a short peptide, right? So perhaps the addition of the HA sequence introduced a stop codon early in the sequence.

Looking at the HA tag's DNA sequence, if the HA is introduced in frame, it should be a few amino acids followed by the GADD45G. But in the given DNA sequence, the HA's sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the HA is only a few amino acids, followed by a stop codon, which would prevent the rest of GADD45G from being expressed.

So the problem is that the HA tag's DNA sequence includes a TGA codon, which is a stop. Therefore, the ribosome stops early, so the GADD45G isn't expressed—only the HA tag's part is expressed, but then the protein stops.

So the issue is that the HA tag's coding sequence introduced an early stop codon, leading to a truncated protein, which is why the overexpression isn't happening as expected.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That fits. Because the HA tag's sequence includes a stop codon (TGA), which the ribosome would hit before the GADD45G sequence is translated.

Alternatively, option C is about a missing linker leading to proteolysis. But if the HA is present but the protein is not expressed, proteolysis probably isn't the issue here. The problem is that the protein isn't being made beyond the HA tag.

So the correct issue is that the HA tag's sequence includes a TGA stop codon, leading to early termination.

Wait, but why is the HA tag followed by TGA? Because the HA determinant's DNA sequence must have been inserted in a way that introduced a TGA. Let me think about how the HA tag is added.

The HA tag is a short sequence, such as YPYDHH, which is from the hemagglutinin of influenza. Its coding sequence would be, say, TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA (just making up some codons for example). If during the insertion, the DNA sequence includes a TGA, it would introduce a stop.

So in the provided construct, the HA tag's DNA ends with TGA, which is a stop codon, so the ribosome stops after the HA tag, and the rest isn't translated.

So the problem is that the HA tag's sequence introduced a stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. So option B is correct.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Missense mutation in HA.

B) Ribosome stopped early.

C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis.

D) No tRNA for UAA.

So in this case, the cause is that there's a stop codon in the HA tag's DNA, leading to early termination. So the issue is premature termination, which is option B.

Wait, but why couldn't the GADD45G be expressed? Because the HA tag's coding sequence includes a TGA, which is a stop codon, before the GADD45G starts. So when the ribosome translates, it starts with the HA, then hits the stop, so no GADD45G is made. So the overexpression fails because the protein isn't made beyond the HA.

So the correct answer is B.


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The provided DNA sequence includes a coding sequence for the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Upon analyzing the sequence, it becomes clear that the HA tag's coding sequence introduces a premature stop codon (TGA) early in the sequence. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length GADD45G protein from being expressed. 

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter the amino acid sequence of the HA tag but would not prevent the full-length GADD45G protein from being expressed. This is not the cause of the issue.
- **Option B**: The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the HA tag's coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein. This matches the observed issue.
- **Option C**: A lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis of the nascent protein, but this would not prevent the initial expression of the protein. The issue here is the lack of full-length protein, not proteolysis.
- **Option D**: The absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant because the stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA.

The root cause of the problem is the premature stop codon introduced by the HA tag's coding sequence, which prevents the ribosome from translating the full-length GADD45G protein.
