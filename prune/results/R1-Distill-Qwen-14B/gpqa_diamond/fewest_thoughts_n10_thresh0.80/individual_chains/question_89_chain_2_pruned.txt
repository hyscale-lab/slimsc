Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is. It involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'll need to go through each step to see what's happening.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. I'm thinking elimination reaction here because KOH is a strong base. So, when vicinal dihalides react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product after KOH would be adamantylene? Or maybe 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the double bond would form between carbons 1 and 3 if the Brs are on 1 and 3. So perhaps the product is 1,3-diene adamantane?

Wait, but the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR data shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is probably an -O- group. Because 4.79 is around where you see ether or alcohol protons. Wait, but KOH is a base and a good nucleophile. Oh wait, maybe it's an elimination with formation of an epoxide? No, wait, elimination to form a double bond would give an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. No, with excess KOH, more likely elimination. Wait, but the IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl group. So maybe the product is a ketone or an ester. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. KOH is a strong base. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming an alkene and releasing two equivalents of HBr. But then where is the carbonyl coming from? Oh wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH. So each Br is at adjacent positions. The reaction would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a diene? But wait, a diene would have two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic structure. So when you eliminate two HBr, you form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? Or maybe a conjugated diene? Alternatively, perhaps it forms a single double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR spectrum is showing a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So the product after KOH is not just an alkene but something else with a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. How could that form? Perhaps a Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement? No, that's more about epoxides. Alternatively, maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that usually requires peracids. Wait, maybe the base is causing elimination and then some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the dibromide is undergoing dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. No, epoxides usually form from vicinal dihalides with treatment with a base like NaOH, but that would form an epoxide. Wait, but in that case, the product would have an ether linkage. The IR would show the C-O stretch, which is around 1100-1250 cm^-1, but the question says 1720 cm^-1, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base is causing an elimination to form a ketone. Oh, wait! Perhaps the reaction is a double elimination with formation of a ketone. For example, a geminal dihalide would eliminate to form a ketone, but here the dihalide is vicinal, not geminal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder scenario? No, not with KOH.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), which is a sharp peak, maybe an AB system or a coupling between two equivalent protons. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests some CH2 groups in a ring. The 1.94 (2H) could be another set of protons, perhaps on a double bond or near an electronegative atom.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, maybe two elimination reactions occur to form a double bond and a carbonyl group. Wait, but two eliminations would require four substituents, but perhaps in the adamantane structure, elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead ketone. Wait, is that possible? Because adamantane has a rigid structure, so forming a ketone at a bridgehead might be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to the formation of a six-membered ring with a carbonyl group. Let me try to sketch the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, four cyclohexane rings in a chair-like arrangement. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on adjacent bridgeheads.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, forming a double bond. Wait, but in that case, it would form a diene, but the IR doesn't support that. So maybe one of the eliminations leads to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would be a substitution, which would require a different mechanism. But KOH is a strong base, so substitution would need a good leaving group. In that case, after two substitutions, we'd have a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Oh, but wait, if the diol is in a structure that can undergo oxidation, but that's not part of the first reaction.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the IR again. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester. So perhaps the product is a diketone? Or maybe a ketone along with another group, like an epoxide.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. For instance, when two adjacent dihalides eliminate, perhaps they form a bridged ketone. I'm not entirely sure, but let's say that product 1 is a ketone.

Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic ketone, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, perhaps heating with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3 could induce some kind of Claisen rearrangement or other pericyclic reaction. Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, the Lewis acid would catalyze ring-opening, but product 1's IR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step one by one.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH → product 1.

I think it's possible that the two Brs undergo elimination, and the product is an alkene. But the IR has a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps one Br is eliminated as HBr, and the other undergoes substitution. Wait, but KOH in excess would likely deprotonate and form an alkoxide, leading to elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then another reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to a Br, leading to formation of a carbonyl via elimination.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a region where you see protons adjacent to oxygen. Maybe it's an epoxide. If product 1 is an epoxide, then the IR would show the C-O-C stretching around 1200-1300 cm^-1. But the given IR is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl (C=O). So perhaps not an epoxide.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, and the 4.79 ppm is something else. Wait, 4.79 could be an AB system, like two equivalent pro
