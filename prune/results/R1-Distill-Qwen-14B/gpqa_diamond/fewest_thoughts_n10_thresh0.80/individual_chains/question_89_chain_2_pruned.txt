Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH to give product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to get product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

Hmm. Let me think about each step.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromines on two non-adjacent carbons. When it's treated with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it probably undergoes elimination. KOH is a strong base, so likely an E2 mechanism. The product would be an alkene, since two adjacent H's are removed along with the bromides.

Wait, but where? 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so if each Br is on a different carbon, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or wait, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate to form 1,3-diene? Or perhaps 1,2-diene? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe elimination occurs to form a less substituted double bond, but adamantane's structure is pretty rigid.

Wait, in the product 1, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). That suggests that product 1 isn't an alkene but maybe a ketone. Wait, so maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh wait, KOH could be causing an elimination reaction, but if the starting material is dihalide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. Alternatively, if the conditions are such that elimination and then some other reaction happens—wait, maybe it's a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. Since 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons (assuming 1 and 3 are adjacent in the adamantane structure?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, which would eliminate to form an alkene. But I thought vicinal dihalides eliminate to form alkenes with E2 mechanism. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, if the Brs are on the same face (anti), they could eliminate to form a double bond.

But then why the IR peak at 1720? That's a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing the reaction. Alternatively, maybe KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps elimination is more favorable. Wait, but if it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination would produce an alkene. But the IR has a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm
