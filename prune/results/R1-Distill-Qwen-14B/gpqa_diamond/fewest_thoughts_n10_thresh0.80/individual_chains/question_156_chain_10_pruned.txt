Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. 

The question is about two reactions involving mCPBA and oct-4-ene in both E and Z configurations. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columnsâ€”standard (achiral) and chiral. We need to determine how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used in epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation adds an oxygen across the double bond, forming an epoxide. So, when (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene react with mCPBA, each will form their respective epoxides.

Wait, but wait. What's the structure of oct-4-ene? Octene is an eight-carbon chain with a double bond. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5, and the substituents on either end are opposite each other. For (Z), they're on the same side.

When mCPBA adds an epoxide, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the epoxide's configuration. But wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic ring-opening. For trans addition, I think that the geometry of the alkene affects the epoxide's stereochemistry.

Wait, no. Let me recall: the epoxidation by mCPBA is a peracid reacting with the alkene. It's a concerted process where the peracid's oxygen adds across the double bond in a trans fashion. Oh wait, no. Wait, when the peracid reacts, the oxygen adds to the same face. Because the mechanism involves the peracid approaching from the same face as the alkene's substituents, leading to a cis addition. Or was it trans? Hmm, I might be getting confused.

Alternatively, thinking about it, the reaction adds an oxygen from the same face for each part. So for a trans-alkene, the epoxide would form with a certain configuration, and for a cis-alkene
