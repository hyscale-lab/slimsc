Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

So, there are two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, they did spectroscopic observations and found the radial velocity (RV) variations for each star in both systems.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. The question is by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. And the mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures their Doppler shifts as they move towards and away from us. The amplitude of the velocity is related to the mass, but I'm not exactly sure how.

Wait, I think the more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude. Because a more massive object would move less around the center of mass. So like, if one star is much more massive, it doesn't move much, while the less massive one moves a lot. So the velocity amplitudes would be inversely proportional to their masses.

So, let's denote the two stars in system_1 as M1 and m1, with velocities V1 and v1. Similarly, system_2 has M2 and m2 with V2 and v2.

The mass ratio would be (M1/m1) = (v1/V1). Because M1 * V1 = m1 * v1, so M1/m1 = v1/V1.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The center of mass requires M1 * V1 = m1 * v1. So M1/m1 = v1 / V1. Yes, that's right.

So the mass of the system is M_total = M1 + m1. But wait, how do we find the individual masses? Because we don't know the actual masses, just the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate the velocities to the masses. I recall that the mass function is involved here, but perhaps in this problem, we can use a simpler approach.

Another approach: The velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So for system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 km/s and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio M1/m1 would be 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is 0.5 times m1. So M1 = 0.5 m1. Then, the total mass of system_1 is M1 + m1 = 0.5 m1 + m1 = 1.5 m1.

Similarly, in system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10 km/s. So their mass ratio would be m2/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. Wait, because M
