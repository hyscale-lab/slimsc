Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves because the planet's gravity makes it wobble, right?

The problem says there are two stars with exactly the same masses as each other, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same host star masses, same planet masses.

They detected the planets using the RV method. For planet #1, the spectral line shifted by up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I remember is something about the velocity semi-amplitude, probably K. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) )) ) * sin(i) )^(something), but since e is zero here (they're circular orbits), sin(i) is 1 because we assume edge-on orbits for maximum Doppler shift.

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(P)), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Oh wait, the actual formula for K is K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune vs Sun, which is much bigger), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So it simplifies.

So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet / M_star^(2/3) ) )

But wait, maybe another approach. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity. The formula for the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is approximately v/c, where v is the velocity of the star. So, the measured shift (5 and 7 milliangstroms) would be proportional to the velocity K.

So, the velocity K is proportional to the Doppler shift. So K1 = 5, K2=7, in some units.

But wait, let me make this precise. The Doppler shift formula is Δλ / λ = v / c. So, K is v, the velocity. So, K1 = (5/λ) * c, but wait no, actually, the shift is in wavelength, so K is the velocity causing that shift. So, K = (Δλ / λ) * c. But since both are measured at the same wavelength (given in the problem, same spectral line), λ is the same for both. So K1 = (5 / λ) * c, K2 = (7 / λ) * c. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

So the ratio K2/K1 is 7/5 = 1.4.

But how does K relate to the orbital period P?

From the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) sqrt(1-e²)), but since e=0, it's K ~ (Mp / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, more accurately, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * [ (1) / ( (P (1 - e²))^(1/2) ) ]

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ (G M_p ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1) / ( sqrt(P) ) )

Wait, no, the formula is more precisely:

K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) ] * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (c)) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I'm trying to think. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v_star) ) = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (2 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But when e=0, sin i is 1 (edge-on), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )/(2 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe a better approach is to consider the ratio of K1 and K2.

Since both stars have the same mass (M) and both planets have same mass (m), but different orbital periods P1 and P2.

So, K1 = (some constants) * (m / M^(2/3)) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = same constants * (m / M^(2/3) ) / ( P2^(1/3) )

So, K1 / K2 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) )

Because when you take the ratio, the constants and m/M terms cancel.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

We have K1 = 5 and K2=7. Wait, no, actually, the problem says that the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom and planet #2 is 7. Since K is proportional to the shift, K1 =5 and K2=7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

Wait, no. Wait, the shift is directly proportional to K. So, K
