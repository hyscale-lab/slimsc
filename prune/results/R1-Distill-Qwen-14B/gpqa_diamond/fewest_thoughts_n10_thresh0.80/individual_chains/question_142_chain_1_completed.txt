Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this must be a mixed state because it's a convex combination of different states.

Wait, |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the standard basis states for a qubit. So each term in the matrix is a projector onto these states. The density matrix ρ is the average of these two projectors. Oh right, because the coefficients are 1/2 each, it's a completely mixed state. So this should represent a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, what about the geometrical position? I think density matrices can be represented as points in a higher-dimensional space. For a qubit, the state is a vector in a 3-dimensional space, right? Because the Bloch sphere is a 2-sphere embedded in 3D space.

Wait, the Bloch sphere describes pure states. For mixed states, the representation is a bit different. The density matrix must lie within the Bloch ball. The pure states are on the surface (the Bloch sphere), and the completely mixed state is at the center.

So the completely mixed state would correspond to the density matrix I/2, where I is the identity matrix. Let me check: for a qubit, the identity matrix is [[1, 0], [0, 1]], so I/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Comparing this with the given ρ, yes, exactly the same. So ρ is the completely mixed state.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3D vector. For the completely mixed state, I/2, that implies r must be zero because (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). Looking at the options, option C is (0, 0, 0), which should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Because sometimes the representation might have the density matrix as I/2 being the center, which is definitely the case here. So yeah, r is zero. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

The options are:
A) (1,1,0)
B) (0,0,1)
C) (0,0,0)
D) (1,1,1)

So the answer must be C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a 3D vector (the Bloch vector). For the completely mixed state, the density matrix simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which corresponds to \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the state lies at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) (1,1,0):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the completely mixed state.
- **B) (0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.
- **C) (0,0,0):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.
- **D) (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid density matrix for a single qubit.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
