Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and where they are positioned in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me remember what a density matrix is. Oh right, a density matrix describes the statistical state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, so it's a convex combination of projectors.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh yeah, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because each basis state (|0> and |1>) is present with equal probability, right?

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, where any pure state |ψ> can be represented as a point on the surface of a unit sphere. For mixed states, the point is inside the sphere.

Wait, but how does the density matrix translate to the Bloch vector? Oh, right! The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So r is (x, y, z), and each component corresponds to the expectation value of the respective Pauli matrix.

Let me write that down. For any 2x2 density matrix, ρ can be expressed as:
ρ = (1/2) (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z )

So, expanding that, since σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], and I is [[1,0],[0,1]].

Given that ρ in the problem is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1|.

|0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (1/2) * I.

Hmm, so ρ is (I)/2. Let's plug that into the general form. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So setting ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, and since ρ is I/2, that implies r·σ must be zero.

So r·σ = x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z = 0 matrix. The only way that's true is if x=0, y=0, z=0. Because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are all non-zero matrices. So the only solution is r = (0,0,0).

Wait, but what about the z-component? Let me think. Because σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so if x, y, z are all zero, then r·σ is zero. So the density matrix becomes (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches the given ρ. So yes, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that must be the answer.

Alternatively, thinking about it another way: the maximally mixed state has no preferred direction, so it should be at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere's surface represents pure states, and the center is the completely mixed state (for a qubit, it's the completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state with equal probabilities for |0> and |1>).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit, where the probabilities of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are equal. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. Any density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning all components of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero (\(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), \(z = 0\)). Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
