Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. Hmm, let's break it down. The problem gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that when a particle is produced, its mean decay length depends on how long it lives before decaying. The longer it lives, the farther it can travel before breaking apart. So the key here is to find the particle's lifetime and then calculate how far it travels at its production energy.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh right, the uncertainty principle! Or more specifically, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the energy uncertainty (which is the width Γ) to the lifetime. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy width and Δt is the lifetime. So maybe the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ ≈ ΔE. Therefore, the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, I should double-check the formula. I think the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense because a larger width (so more uncertainty in energy) implies a shorter lifetime, which aligns with Heisenberg's principle.

Once I have the lifetime, the next step is to find the velocity of the particle. Because the mean decay distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime. But wait, the production energy is given, so I can find the velocity from that.

The production energy is the total energy of the meson. So E_X is 8 GeV, and the rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Solving for p, the momentum: p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²) / c². Wait, let me get the units right. E and m are in GeV, but when I use them with Planck's constant, I need to convert them to consistent units, like joules.

Wait, maybe it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm not too confident. Alternatively, I can convert everything into SI units.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the momentum p of the meson using E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Wait, E is given as production energy, which is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV/c². So let's compute p.

E = 8 GeV = 8e9 eV
m = 1.2 GeV/c² = 1.2e9 eV/c²
c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

So E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So (pc)^2 =
