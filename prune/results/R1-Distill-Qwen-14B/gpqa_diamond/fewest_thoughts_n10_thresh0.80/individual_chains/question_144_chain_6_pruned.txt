Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance is related to how long they live on average before decaying. 

The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, I think the width is the decay width, which is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (which is the width Γ) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (the lifetime τ) should be on the order of ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. 

But wait, the exact relation is Γ = ħ / τ, right? Because the width is inversely proportional to the lifetime. Once I have the lifetime τ, I can find the mean decay distance. The mean decay distance L is the product of the velocity v of the particle and the lifetime τ, so L = v * τ. 

So first, I'll calculate the lifetime τ using Γ. Let me make sure about the units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units of GeV·s or something. I'll need to convert everything properly.

Wait, let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the
