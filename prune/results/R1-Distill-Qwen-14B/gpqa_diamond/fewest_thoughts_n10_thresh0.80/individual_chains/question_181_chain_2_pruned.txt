Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. But wait, I thought the neutrinos produced in the Sun take about 8 minutes to reach Earth because that's how long it takes light to travel from the core to the surface. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would just be arriving now, right? But the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands.

Hmm, the pp-III branch is one of the proton-proton chain reactions. I remember that in the Sun, the main source of energy is the proton-proton chain, which has a couple of branches. The pp-I branch produces a boron-8 isotope, which then decays into beryllium, and then emits a positron and two neutrinos. Oh wait, but isn't that the part where the neutrinos are emitted? So if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production?

Wait, no, the pp-III branch might be a different part of the proton-proton chain. Let me think. Oh, right, the proton-proton chain has two main branches: the dominant one (pp-I) and another (pp-II and pp-III). The pp-III branch is a minor contributor, I think. If the pp-III stops, then that specific neutrino production pathway would stop.

But wait, neutrinos are produced in different processes. The main solar neutrinos come from the decay of Beryllium-7, which comes from the pp-I branch. Oh, right, because in the pp-I process, two protons fuse to form deuterium, then another proton fuses to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 nuclei fuse into helium-4, producing two positrons and two neutrinos. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify: the dominant process is the pp-I branch, which produces a helium-4 nucleus and emits two neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III branches are less significant.

Wait, so perhaps the pp-III branch is a side reaction. If it stops, then any neutrinos produced by that branch would stop. But how does that affect the overall neutrino flux?

Wait,
