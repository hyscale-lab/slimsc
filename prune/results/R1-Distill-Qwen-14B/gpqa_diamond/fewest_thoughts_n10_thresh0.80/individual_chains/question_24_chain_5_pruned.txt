Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The problem says we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids cause bromine water to decolorize, which usually means they have unsaturated bonds like alkenes or alkynes. So, X is a mixture of two such compounds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction that forms another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids through a disproportionation reaction. Wait, what's a disproportionation reaction? Oh right, it's when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. But here, it's a mixture, so maybe each component undergoes a reaction where one is hydrogenated and the other maybe dehydrogenated? Or perhaps one becomes more saturated and the other less? Not entirely sure yet.

Importantly, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the components of Y are fully saturated—no double or triple bonds. Because if they had unsaturated bonds, bromine would add across them, causing decolorization.

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they each give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Wait, let me calculate that. If it's 14.28% H, that's approximately 1/7, right? Because 14.28 is roughly 100/7 ≈14.2857. So the mass fraction is 1/7, which implies that the molecular formula might have a ratio of H to the rest (C and H) such that hydrogen is 1/7.

Wait, but let's think about the molecular formula. Let's say the formula is CnHm. The percentage of H is (m/(12n + m)) *100 = 14.28. So m/(12n + m) = 0.1428. Let's solve for m.

Multiply both sides by (12n + m): m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428m

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572m ≈1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572: m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572) *n ≈2n.

Wait, 1.7136 is approximately 12*0.1428, which is 1.7136. So, 1.7136/0.8572 is approximately 2. So m ≈2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. Which is like ethylene (C2H4) or something similar. Wait, but ethylene is C2H4, which when hydrogenated becomes ethane (C2H6). Oh wait, no, because ethylene would add H2 to become ethane. But wait, their hydrogenation gives Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H.

Wait, but let me calculate the percentage for ethane. Ethane is C2H6. Molar mass is 2*12 +6 =30. Hydrogen percentage is (6*1)/(30) = 20%. That's higher than 14.28%. So perhaps Z isn't ethane.

Wait, trying another approach. Let's assume Z is an alkane because if it doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be fully saturated. So let's find an alkane where H is 14.28%.

For an alkane, CnH2n+2.

The percentage of H is (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2) *100 = (2n+2)/(14n +2) *100.

We need this to be 14.28. Let me set up the equation:

(2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator: 2n +2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Calculate the right side: 0.1428*(14n) = 2n, and 0.1428*2=0.2856.

So 2n +2 = 2n + 0.2856.

Subtract 2n from both sides: 2 = 0.2856. Wait, that can't be. So this suggests that perhaps Z isn't an alkane. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my assumption. Let me think again. Maybe Z is a different type of hydrocarbon, like a cycloalkane or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me calculate Z's molecular formula directly. The percentage of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7, as I thought before. So if the molar mass is 7 parts, with H being 1 part.

Wait, let's say the formula is CHx. Then, the mass of H is x/(12 + x) = 1/7.

So x/(12+x) = 1/7 → 7x =12 +x →6x=12 →x=2. So the formula is CH2.

But that doesn't make sense because CH2 is not a stable molecule. So perhaps the formula is larger.

Wait, maybe the formula is CnH2. Let's see: (2)/(12n +2) =1/7 → 2*7=12n +2 →14=12n+2 →12n=12 →n
