Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So the magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field. Initially, the field is pointing in the +Z direction, same as the magnetic moment.

Then, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the initial field is B in +Z, then it's turned off, and a new field B in +Y is applied. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, the average oscillates. So I'm thinking about what causes oscillations in such a system. Oh right, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The spin precesses around the new magnetic field direction.

Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz because the magnetic field is along Z. When the field is switched to Y, the system's Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y instead of S_z. Since the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, it starts to evolve over time, causing oscillations in expectation values.

The magnetic moment in the z-direction oscillates. The average <mu_z> would vary sinusoidally over time, I think. The frequency of this oscillation would come from the energy difference between the spin states in the new field.

The energy levels for a spin in a magnetic field are given by E = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma * S, and B is along Y, the energy becomes proportional to S_y. But wait, for spin-1/2, the possible eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energy difference between the two states would be proportional to the difference in these S_y values.

Wait, the energy levels when the field is along Y would be E_+ = (gamma)(ħ/2) * B and E_- = (-gamma)(ħ/2) * B. So the energy difference Delta E is E_+ - E_- = gamma * ħ * B.

The oscillation frequency in the expectation value comes from the energy difference divided by Planck's constant. The frequency omega is (Delta E)/ħ. Let's compute that: (gamma * ħ * B) / ħ = gamma * B.

Wait, but wait a second. The options have some gamma*B terms. Option B is gamma*B, option A is gamma*B/2, etc. But wait, what about the spin's precession frequency? Oh, when you have a spin under a magnetic field, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma * B. So does that mean the oscillation frequency is the same as the Larmor frequency?

Wait, but when the field changes from Z to Y, the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. The state after the field change will evolve under the new Hamiltonian proportional to S_y. The time evolution of the expectation value of S_z would involve terms oscillating with frequency based on the energy difference.

Let me think about the time evolution more carefully. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. When the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y, the state will evolve according to the new H.

The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ). For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. The initial state |+z> can be expressed as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

The time evolution would then cause each component to acquire a phase factor. The energy for |+y> is E_+ = (gamma B) (ħ/2), and for |-y> it's E_- = (-gamma B)(ħ/2). So the time evolution would lead to phases exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) and exp(-i E_- t / ħ), which are exp(-i gamma B t/2) and exp(+i gamma B t/2), respectively.

So, the state after time t is a combination of |+y> and |-y> with these phase factors. When calculating the expectation value of S_z, which is the operator with eigenvalues ± ħ/2 in the z basis, we can compute <S_z> as follows.

Wait, the expectation value of S_z in the state after time t would involve interference between the |+y> and |-y> components, leading to oscillations. Let me model this.

Let me write the initial state as |+z>. The expansion in terms of |+y> and |-y> can be done using the standard spin rotations. The |+y> state can be expressed as (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and the |-y> state as (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2).

So the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). Because when you plug in |+y> and |-y> into |+z>, you get |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2). So the initial state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

After time t, the state becomes:

( |+y> exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) + |-y> exp(-i E_- t/ħ) ) / sqrt(2)

Plugging in E_+ and E_-, which are gamma B (ħ/2) and -gamma B (ħ/2):

E_+ t
