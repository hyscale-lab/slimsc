Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. Wait, normalization? Oh right, wave functions need to be normalized so that the total probability is 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, that's a bit unusual. Oh, wait, the question says each particle can move along a tube, which I think means it's one-dimensional, so x is the position.

The setup says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is defined as this expression only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Because if the particles aren't found outside that range, the wave function must be zero there. So the actual wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3.

So the wave function ψ(x) is zero when x <1 and x>3. So for 1 ≤ x ≤3, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that's a complex function. Oh, right, wave functions can be complex. But for normalization, I think I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1.

Wait, but wait, the wave function is given as a function that's the same for all particles, but each particle's position is measured and found between 1 and 3. So the wave function is non-zero only in that interval, and zero outside. So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So how do I square the magnitude of a complex number? Oh right, |a + bi|² = a² + b². So ψ(x) is a complex number where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split the integral into two parts: the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x), so this becomes a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2) because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is ln(2). Wait, wait, no: wait, 1+3 is 4, 1+1 is 2. So the integral is a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² ln(2), because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and 2 ln(2) minus ln(2) is ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² =
