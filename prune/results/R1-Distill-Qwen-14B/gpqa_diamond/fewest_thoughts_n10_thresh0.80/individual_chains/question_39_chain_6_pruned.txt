Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function, given that when particles are measured, their positions are only found between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's the wave function ψ(x), right? But wait, the wave function in quantum mechanics should satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. Oh, right, the integral of the probability density must equal 1.

So, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of ψ. Since ψ has a real part and an imaginary part, the absolute square would be (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))².

Let me write ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because (Imaginary part) squared is (0.5)^2, right?

Wait, no, the absolute square is (Re)^2 + (Im)^2. So ψ*ψ is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, since the imaginary part is -0.5i, its square is (-0.5)^2.

Wait, actually, ψ is written as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ is a complex function, Re = a/sqrt(1+x), Im = -0.5.

So, |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because the square of the imaginary part is (0.5)^2 regardless of the sign.

But wait, the wave function is supposed to be zero outside of x=1 to x=3, because when they measured, particles are only found between 1 and 3. But the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't look like a wave function that's zero outside of some region. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function as given is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Oh, but the wave function as written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that's a function that's non-zero for all x where 1+x>0, so x > -1. But the measurements only found particles between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the given ψ is only valid in that region, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe the given ψ is the part that's non-zero between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. I think that's the assumption.

So, the wave function is non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise. So, when calculating the normalization integral, I should integrate from x=1 to x=3, and the rest contributes nothing.

So, the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Wait, but wait, another thing. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So, it's a complex function. But in reality, the wave function must satisfy the Schrodinger equation, but perhaps the given form is just a specific solution in that region.

But perhaps I should proceed with the normalization. So, the probability density is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, that would be the case if Re(ψ) squared plus Im(ψ) squared is the probability density. So yes, correct.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, let me compute that integral. Let
