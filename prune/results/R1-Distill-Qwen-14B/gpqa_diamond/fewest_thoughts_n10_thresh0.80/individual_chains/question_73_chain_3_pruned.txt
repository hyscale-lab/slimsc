Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through this.

The question says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and the other 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Because when objects are moving close to the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, that's the one where you can't just say v_rel = 0.6c - 0.5c because that would give 0.1c, which is probably not the right approach here.

So the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Let me write that down. Here, u is the speed of one astronaut relative to the other... Wait, actually, I think I should be careful about the reference frames. Let me clarify: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait no, actually, the problem asks for the relative speed between them. So I think you can compute the relative speed using that formula. Let me confirm. So u is the velocity of B in the frame where A is at rest? Or is u the velocity of A as seen from B's frame? No, wait, in the given scenario, both are moving in the same direction relative to the lab frame. So from the lab frame, A is at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So the relative speed of B with respect to A would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate that.

Wait wait, no. Wait, no, the formula is (u' - v) / (1 - u' v /c²), where u' is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the original frame. So in this case, if I'm in the frame of A, which is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab, then B's velocity in the lab is 0.5c. So from A's frame, B's velocity u' is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ). Let me compute this.

So numerator: 0.5c minus 0.6c is -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 -0.3=0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.14286 c. Since speed is positive, it's 0.14286 c. So about 0.14c. But wait, the options have 0.14c as an option, so that's one part.

Wait, but the problem says "relative speed", so direction matters in sign, but the question just asks for the speed, so the magnitude would be 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that narrows it down to C or D.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². Since they're moving at high speeds, I can't just use classical kinetic energy; I have to use E = gamma m c².

So astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Let's calculate gamma for A. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v=0.6c, so (v/c)^2 is 0.36. 1 -0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma for B: (v/c)^2 is 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)= approx 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 1.1547 times 3 is about 3.4641. So E_A is 2.5 m c² and E_B is about 3.4641 m c². So the total energy is 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c². Hmm, looking at the options:

Option C: E=5.96 mc^2.

Option B: E=4.96 mc^2.

So seems like option C is matching the relative speed of 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc^2. So the correct answer would be option
