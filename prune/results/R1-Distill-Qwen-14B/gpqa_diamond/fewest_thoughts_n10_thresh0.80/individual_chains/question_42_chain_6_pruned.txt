Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3, which have circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects this problem. Maybe it's just background info.

The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So the temperatures are T1:T2 = 1.4, and T2:T3 = 2.3. Wait, so T1 is higher than T2, and T2 is higher than T3. So Planet3 is the coldest, Planet1 the hottest?

Mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So mass-wise, Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more than Planet3.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So, Period3 / Period1 = ?

All planets have the same albedo of 0.3, like Earth. So albedo isn't a varying factor here. Albedo affects how much light is reflected, but since it's the same for all, it doesn't come into the equation directly, I think.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its orbital period. Also, Kepler's third law comes into play when determining orbital periods based on distance and mass.

Let me think about the equilibrium temperature formula. The equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet is given by:

Te = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star.

But since all three planets are around the same star, L and σ are constants. The albedo a is given as 0.3 for all, so that cancels out when taking ratios of temperatures.

So for two planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would be proportional to the inverse square root of the ratio of their distances cubed? Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more carefully.

Wait, no. Let me write the formula correctly.

The equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by:

Te = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

So if we take the ratio of Te1 and Te2:

Te1 / Te2 = [ (D2²) / (D1²) ) ]^(1/4) * [L/(L)]^(1/4) * [ (1 - a)/(1 - a) ]^(1/4)

But since L, a, and σ are the same for all, the ratio simplifies to:

(Te1 / Te2) = (D2 / D1)^(1/2)

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because D squared in the denominator, and when you take the fourth root, you get D^(1/2) in the denominator. So:

Te ∝ 1 / sqrt(D)

So if Te1/Te2 = 1.4, then (D2/D1)^(1/2) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 → 1.96.

Wait, no. Wait, Te1/Te2 = (D2
