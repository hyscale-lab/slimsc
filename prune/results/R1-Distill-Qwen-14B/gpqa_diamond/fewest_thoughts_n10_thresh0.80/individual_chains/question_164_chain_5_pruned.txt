Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass. The question is about determining the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2.

The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period here is the time between two primary eclipses. Oh right, the orbital period of the binary system is the same as the eclipse period because the stars have to lap each other for the eclipses to happen again.

Then, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh, and the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars. So the total mass for each system is the sum of their individual masses.

I think I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star orbits with a smaller velocity. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the star with lower mass moves faster in its orbit.

So the RV amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The more massive star has a lower K. Like, K1 is lower than K2 if star 1 is more massive than star 2.

Wait, but how do we find the mass ratio? I think the mass ratio q is (M2)/(M1), and the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. So if star 1 has velocity K1 and star 2 has K2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So q is the mass ratio, which is (M2/M1) = (K1/K2). So q = K1 / K2.

Oh, but wait, I think the RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. So if the two stars have velocities K1 and K2, then M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, let me think again. The system's total mass is M = M1 + M2. The center of mass is at a point where M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are the orbital radii. The orbital period is the same for both.

The velocity of each star is 2πa1 / P and 2πa2 / P. So K1 = (2π a1)/P, K2 = (2π a2)/P. Since M1 a1 = M2 a2, then a1 = (M2/(M1)) a2. So K1 = 2π (M2/(M1) a2) / P. K2 is 2π a2 / P.

So K1 = (M2/M1) * K2. So K1/K2 = M2/M1 = q. So the mass ratio q is K1/K2.

But wait, M1 is the mass of the star with
