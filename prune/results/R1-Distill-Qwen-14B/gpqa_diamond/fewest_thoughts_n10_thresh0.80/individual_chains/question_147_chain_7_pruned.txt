Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and it's about particle annihilation. Hmm, I remember that when particles and their antiparticles collide, they annihilate each other, right? So the process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, wait, I think I should double-check the notation. Oh right, the p is a proton and the p̄ is an antiproton. So when they annihilate, they produce these A⁺ and A⁻ particles.

The question says that the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, 'slowly' probably means that its speed is much less than the speed of light, so maybe non-relativistic? Or perhaps it's just that it's moving at a certain speed that we need to calculate. But wait, the problem gives the rest mass energy of A as mA c² = 300 MeV. So each A particle has that rest mass energy.

I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are given as fractions of the speed of light, so the answer will be in terms like 0.96c or something.

Let me think about conservation laws here. Since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, their rest masses are important. Wait, the proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², same as the antiproton because they're just matter and antimatter. So when they annihilate, the total energy and momentum are conserved.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So its kinetic energy is low compared
