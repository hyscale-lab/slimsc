Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease called anthracnose. The question involves some knockout mutants and their resistance levels. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out the gene interactions based on the given data.

The setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The resistance percentages are compared to the wild type, which is 100%. So a higher percentage means more resistance.

The results are:
- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely resistant)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very low resistance)
- g2g3: 0% (also no resistance)
- g1g2: 0% (no resistance)

The question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So maybe one of them is a master regulator.

Wait, the options refer to transcription factors, pleiotropy, epistasis, and gene redundancy. Let me think about what each term means.

Epistasis comes into play when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene B can only be seen when gene A is functional. So if a double mutant has the same phenotype as a single mutant, perhaps one gene is epistatic.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But here, all are about the same trait—resistance to anthracnose. Not sure if that's relevant.

Gene redundancy is when two or more genes can perform the same function. So if mutants in both genes have a worse phenotype than either single mutant, that suggests redundancy. Wait, no—if you have redundancy, knocking out both might not make things worse because each can compensate. Hmm, maybe the opposite.

Looking at the data, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero. That's a big effect. So G2 seems crucial. Also, the double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also have zero resistance. Hmm.

Let me think about each gene's effect:

- g2: 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant is completely susceptible. That suggests G2 is necessary for resistance. Maybe it's a transcription factor that activates other genes needed for resistance.

Now, looking at the other single mutants:

g1: 75% resistance. So without G1, resistance is reduced but not gone.

g3: 50% resistance. So without G3, the resistance is halved.

So G1 and G3 each contribute some level of resistance when knocked out, but not as severely as G2.

Now, double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. Since g2 alone is 0%, that's the same as the double. So perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1? Because the presence of a non-functional G2 masks any effect of G1.

g1g3: 10% resistance. So without both G1 and G3, the resistance is even lower than either single. Wait, the single knockout of G3 gives 50% and G1 gives 75%. So together, it's much worse. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be providing some additive or redundant functions. Or maybe they're in parallel pathways.

g2g3: 0% resistance. So same as g2 alone. Again, because G2 is knocked out, the effect of G3 is masked.

So let's think about the hierarchy. G2 is the most critical. Without G2, everything fails. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, or other downstream genes. Alternatively, G2 could be in a pathway upstream of both.

Looking at the double mutants:

In g1g3, the resistance is lower than either single, so 10% is worse than either 75 or 50. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in parallel pathways. For example, if G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, then knocking both out would result in lower resistance than either alone.

But wait, why is the double mutant only 10%? That's worse than both. So if G1 contributes 25% (since without it, 75% is 25% loss?), and G3 contributes 50% loss. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of gene function. Let's imagine that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then, knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. So, in the single mutants:

g2: G1 and G3 not expressed → resistance is 0% (so both are necessary for resistance).

But wait, in the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, but G2 and G3 are functional. So perhaps G3 is still contributing. Similarly, g3 has 50% resistance, so G1 is still contributing.

So maybe G1 and G3 are downstream targets of G2. Without G2, both are off, so no resistance. Without G1, G3 is still on, contributing some resistance. Without G3, G1 is still on, but less (50% is more than 75% resistance? Wait, the numbers: 75% is higher than 50%. Wait, the higher the percentage, the more resistant. So in g1, 75% resistance. Without G1, the plant is 75% as resistant as the wild type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance.

Similarly, g3 is 50% → so knocking out G3 reduces resistance more than knocking out G1.

Wait, but if G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. Similarly, in g3 mutant, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed.

But in the double mutants:

g1g3: Both G1
