Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. This caused a mixture of gases to form. The gases were passed through three tubes:

1. Tube №1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, and its weight increased by 3.60 grams.
2. Tube №2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution, but its weight didn't change.
3. Tube №3 has red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80 grams (CuO formed).

After that, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I think the salts A and B must be decomposing when heated, producing various gases. The gases then reacted with the substances in each tube.

Given that tube 1 gained mass, it probably absorbed some moisture or something. Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, so maybe it absorbed water? Or perhaps some other gas that reacts with it. Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can absorb water vapor. So if the gas from the salts contained water vapor, tube 1 would gain mass.

But wait, the salts are heated without air, so maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Let me think about what kind of salts decompose on heating. For example, nitrates decompose into nitrites and oxygen, or maybe carbonates decompose into carbon dioxide and a metal oxide.

But let's think about the first tube. The weight increased by 3.60 grams. If Mg(ClO4)2 is absorbing water, which is H2O, then the mass gained would be the mass of H2O. The formula for Mg(ClO4)2 is Mg(ClO4)2. It reacts with water: Mg(ClO4)2 (s) + H2O (g) → Mg(ClO4)2·H2O (s). So the mass increase would be equal to the mass of H2O absorbed.

So the mass gain is 3.60g, which would be the mass of H2O. Let's verify that: H2O has a molar mass of 18 g/mol. So moles of H2O = 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

Hmm, okay. So 0.2 moles of H2O were present in the gas mixture.

What about the third tube? Tube 3 has red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80g. The reaction is probably CO or some other reducing gas reacting with copper. Wait, if the gas is CO, it would react with CuO. Let me think: CO is a reducing agent. So maybe the gas is CO, which reduces CuO to Cu and forms CO2.

Wait, but in this case, the copper is red-hot. So perhaps the gas is H2, which reacts with CuO. Let me think. The reaction for H2 and
