Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, it's a two-dimensional metric because it's only involving dx and dy. So, I'm dealing with a 2D surface.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature. I think in two dimensions, it's called the hyperbolic plane, but a pseudosphere is a specific shape in 3D that has constant negative curvature.

Wait, but the metric here looks a bit like something from a hyperbolic geometry. Let me see. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which reminds me of the metric for a hyperboloid. Because for a hyperboloid of one sheet, the metric can have terms like 1/(sqrt(1 + x² + y²)) but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. The general form for a metric in 2D is ds² = E dx² + G dy² + cross terms maybe. Here, it's (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So it's conformally flat, since it's just a scalar function times the flat metric.

I think the area of a surface in such a metric can be found by integrating the area element. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in this case, since it's diagonal, the determinant is just the product of E and G. Here, E = G = 32/(4 -x² - y²). So the determinant g would be E*G = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2. So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, no, sqrt(g) is the square root of the determinant. Since the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2, because the metric is diagonal with both E and G equal. So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, no. Wait, the metric is written as ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are:

g_{xx} = 32/(4 -x² -y²)
g_{yy} = same as g_{xx}
All other components are zero.

So the determinant g is g_{xx} * g_{yy} = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. That would be sqrt( (32/(4 -x² -y²))^2 ) dx dy. The square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

So the area of the entire surface would be the integral of this over all x and y where the metric is defined. So the domain is where 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² < 4. That's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area would be integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but this might diverge. Let me see. The integral is ∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, switching to polar coordinates. Because x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r dr / (4 - r²) ) ].

Let's compute the radial integral first. Let me make a substitution: u = 4 - r². Then
