Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance formula involves some parameters like lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Let me think.

Wait, a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same. But wait, no, actually, in a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, but the angles between them (alpha, beta, gamma) are equal as well. Oh right, the question says alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral or cubic system? No, wait, cubic is a special case of rhombohedral where all angles are 90 degrees. So here, since the angles are 30, it's definitely rhombohedral.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms, which in a crystal structure is the same as the lattice parameter 'a' if it's a simple cubic structure. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but given that it's rhombohedral, a = b = c. So the interatomic distance is equal to a. So a = 10 Angstroms.

Now, the interplanar distance formula for a crystal plane with Miller indices (hkl) is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

Wait, is that correct? Or is there another version? Oh right, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with a rhombohedral lattice is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, no, wait. The formula I think is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So the formula simplifies.

Let me plug in the numbers. The plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1² + 1² +1²) - 2*(1*1 cos 30° + 1*1 cos 30° + 1*1 cos 30°) )

Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, the numerator of the sqrt is:

1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the second part is:

2*(cos30 + cos30 + cos30) = 2*(3 cos30) = 6 cos30°.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 6 cos30°).

Wait, but wait, the formula is h² + k² + l² minus 2*(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α). Since α, β, γ are all 30°, each term is cos30°, and each of the three terms is 1*1 cos30, etc.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 - 6 cos30°).

Compute cos30°: it's sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 = 5.196.

So 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Wait, that can't be right because the square root of a negative number is not a real number. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

I think I might have mixed up the formula. Another version I recall is that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Since in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal to θ (which is 30° here).

So let me try that formula.

So h=1, k=1, l=1.

So:

h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 3.

hk + hl + kl = (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) = 3.

So the denominator inside the sqrt becomes 3 - 2*(3)* cos30°.

So 3 - 6 * cos30°.

Again, same as before. Which leads to the same problem: 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have used the formula with cos(180 - θ) somewhere? Because in some crystal systems, the angles used in the formula are the supplementary angles. Let me think—rhombohedral systems can be either acute (angles <90) or obtuse (angles>90). The formula might require using 180 - theta for the angle in some cases. Oh wait, I think that in the interplanar distance formula, the angles used are the angles between the lattice vectors, which for rh
