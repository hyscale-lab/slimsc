Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my geometry here, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the lattice parameters are equal (a = b = c), and all the angles between them are the same, so α = β = γ. In this case, each angle is 30 degrees. So the unit cell is like a cube that's been deformed a bit, but all edges are the same and all angles are equal.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 angstroms. I think that refers to the edge length of the unit cell, right? So a = 10 A. Because in a rhombohedral crystal, a, b, c are all the same. So a = 10.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh right, the formula for the interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) )

Wait, but wait, that formula is more general for orthorhombic or cubic systems. Wait, no, maybe I should recall the correct formula for a rhombohedral system. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the Miller indices and the unit cell parameters.

Alternatively, I remember that in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But since this is a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of hexagonal? No, wait, rhombohedral is part of the trigonal class, but the unit cell is a cube with all sides equal and angles possibly different. Oh wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, the angles can be different, but in our case, all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, but I'm confusing with hexagonal systems. Hmm. Let me get the formula right. The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα)/(a²)

Wait, no, maybe it's adjusted for the specific angles. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is a bit complicated. But since in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c and all angles are equal, perhaps the formula simplifies.

Yes, because a = b = c = 10 A, and α = β = γ = 30°, so we can plug those into the formula. So the formula for d becomes:

d² = a² / [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) ]

Because in rhombohedral, all the angles are the same, so cos α = cos β = cos γ.

So for the (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

Plugging in the numbers:

d² = (10)^2 / [ (1 + 1 + 1) + 2( (1*1) cos30° + (1*1) cos30° + (1*1) cos30° ) ]

Let's compute the denominator first.

Denominator = 3 + 2*( (1 + 1 + 1) * cos30° )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2*(hk cosα + hl cosα + kl cos alpha) becomes 2*( (1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 ) * cos30° )

So that's 2*(3 * cos30° )

Wait, because hk is 1*
