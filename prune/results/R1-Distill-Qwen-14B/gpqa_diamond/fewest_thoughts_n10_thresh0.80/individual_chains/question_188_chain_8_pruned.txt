Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and the lattice parameters.

Alright, let's start by recalling what a rhombohedral crystal is. I think it's a type of crystal system where all the lattice vectors are of equal length, but the angles between them can be different. Oh wait, no, wait. In a rhombohedral system, the three vectors a, b, c are equal in length (so a = b = c) but the angles α, β, γ can vary. Oh but wait, the question says all angles are 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral system with α=β=γ=30°, and each interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a? I think so because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be equal to a, but in a rhombohedral, if a is the edge length, then the atoms are along the edges maybe.

Wait, but the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. So the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom. So a = 10 Å.

We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance (d) is calculated using the formula derived from the Miller indices. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)( (cos α)/(cos β) ) + ... ) Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, there's a formula that involves the reciprocal of the plane's indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system. The formula I remember is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk)(cos γ) + 2(hl)(cos β) + 2(kl)(cos α)}}}

Wait, no, I might be getting this wrong. Another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system can be given by
