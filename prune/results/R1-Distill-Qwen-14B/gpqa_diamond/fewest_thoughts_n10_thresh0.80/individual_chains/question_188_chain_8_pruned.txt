Okay, I'm trying to solve this crystallography problem. So, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that for crystals, interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral. I think a rhombohedral crystal system has all edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees each. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance... does that refer to the lattice parameter 'a'? I think so. Because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a cube that's been skewed, so each edge is the same length 'a'. So here, a = 10 Angstrom.

The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2 hk cos α + 2 hk cos β + 2 hl cos γ) ))? Wait, no, I think it's different. Oh wait, no, the formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) )) }

Wait, wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For a cubic system, it's simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But for a rhombohedral, which is a special case where a = b = c and α = β = γ, the formula must be adjusted.

Wait, I've heard about the Miller indices and the formula involving the reciprocal of d squared. Maybe the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2 hk cos α)/(a²) + (2 hl cos β)/(a²) + (2 kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so α = β = γ. So in this problem, each angle is 30 degrees.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So let me plug in those values. Let me rewrite the formula correctly:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) * (1/a²) + (2 hk cos α)/(a²) + (2 hl cos β)/(a²) + (2 kl cos γ)/(a²)

But since α = β = γ = 30 degrees, and a=10.

So substituting:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

1/d² = [ (1 + 1 + 1) ]/(10^2) + [ 2*(1*1)*cos(30) ]/(10^2) + [ 2*(1*1)*cos(30) ]/(10^2) + [ 2*(1*1)*cos(30) ]/(10^2 )

Wait, because for each term hk, hl, kl, each product is 1*1=1, so each term is 2*1*1*cos30 / a².

So, since we have three terms each with 2hk cosθ, and each hk is 1*1, each term is 2*1*1*cos30/(10²).

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute (h² +k² + l²) = 3, so 3/(10²) = 3/100 = 0.03.

Next, each of the three cross terms (hk, hl, kl) contributes 2*1*1*cos30/(10²).

cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So each of the three terms is (2 * 0.8660) / 100 = (1.732) / 100 = 0.01732.

Since there are three such terms, total cross terms contribute 3 * 0.01732 = 0.05196.

Adding the two parts together: 0.03 + 0.05196 = 0.08196.

So 1/d² = 0.08196.

Therefore, d² = 1 / 0.08196 ≈ let's compute that.

Wait, 0.08196 is approximately 1/12.2, since 1/12 is about 0.08333. Hmm, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1/0.08196 ≈ 12.202.

So d = sqrt(12.202) ≈ 3.492 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and the (111) plane's interplanar distance should be smaller than a, right? Because planes closer together have smaller d.

Wait, wait, wait a minute. I must have made a mistake here. Because the formula I used seems to give d as 3.49 Angstroms, but the options are in the 8-10 range. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me think again. Another formula comes to mind involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters in a more general setting. Oh wait, maybe I should use the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (a^2) ) + 2(hk a^2 cos α) + 2(hl a^2 cos β) + 2(kl a^2 cos γ) )} } ?

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me get the correct formula. Oh, perhaps the correct formula is:

d^2 = [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ ] / (a² (1 + ... something?)).

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, another approach. In a rhombohedral system, the metric tensor is used. The interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d^2 = \frac{1}{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)} 

Wait, but wait, that would be for a system where a = b = c and angles are α, etc. So perhaps in this case, since a = b = c, and all angles are 30 degrees, the formula becomes:

d^2 = 1/(a²) * 1/[ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) ]

Wait, but wait, because in a rhombohedral system, α = β = γ. So, substituting that, the equation becomes:

d² = [1/(a²)]
