Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns. I need to find out how many peaks they observe in each case.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.
Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

After both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC column. I need to find out the number of peaks in each.

Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I should figure out what each reaction does.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the ketone group at position 3 will become an alcohol. The structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5.

So when it reduces, the ketone (C3) becomes a CHOH group. So the product of Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5? Or wait, the starting material is (S) at which carbon?

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no. Let me draw it correctly.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(O)-(CH2)2-CH3. But with a methoxy group at position 5.

Wait, hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, numbering from the other end? No, n=6, so positions 1 to 6. Hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps I should structure it as:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2 ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the ketone is on carbon 3, and the methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2?

Wait, no, that's five carbons. Wait, hexan means six carbons. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, that can't be because hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So with the methoxy on carbon 5, which is the fourth carbon from the ketone.

Wait, but wait, positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So position 3 is the ketone, position 5 is two carbons away. So structure is:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C(O)-
4: CH2-
5: CH(OCH3)-
6: CH3.

So the structure is: CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH3.

So when reduced with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride), which is a strong reducing agent, it will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. So the product will be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. When the ketone is reduced, the configuration at C3 would be a new stereocenter? Because the ketone is a planar carbonyl, so the reduction could lead to a racemic mixture, but wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer because it's (S)-configured. So when the ketone is reduced, the new hydroxyl will have a specific configuration.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the configuration at C5 is S. When you reduce the ketone at C3, you add two hydrogens, and because the carbonyl is planar, the attack of the hydride can happen from either side, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, no, wait. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so when the ketone is reduced, the configuration at C3 will depend on the starting structure.

Wait, no, the ketone at C3 is a carbonyl group, which is not a stereocenter. So when you reduce it, you form a new stereocenter at C3.

Wait, the original molecule is (S) at C5, but C3 is a carbonyl, so not a stereocenter. After reduction, C3 becomes a CHOH group, so a stereocenter. So the product will be a secondary alcohol with a new stereocenter at C3, but what's its configuration?

Wait, but since the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction of the ketone at C3 is an addition reaction, will the configuration at C3 be determined by the starting structure? Hmm, possibly not. Because LAH is a strong reducing agent and the reaction is done under certain conditions. But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, when the ketone is reduced, the resulting alcohol's configuration depends on the approach of the hydride. Since the starting material is chiral (S), the reaction could lead to a specific diastereomer. Alternatively, maybe it leads to a racemic mixture, but since the starting material is chiral, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer? Wait, no, because the reduction is at a different position.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer. Let me think. Let's imagine the molecule: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

The structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol, but no, only the ketone is being reduced.

Wait, no, the other groups are not being reduced. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with an OH group on C3.

But since the starting material was S configuration at C5, does that affect the configuration at C3? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the product's configuration depends on the reaction conditions. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically gives the most stable alcohol. But in this case, the ketone is in a specific environment. So the reduction could lead to a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces a racemic mixture, but since the starting material was chiral, the product would be a single enantiomer. Wait, but no, because the reduction is at a different carbon. Let me think. The starting molecule is chiral at C5, but the ketone is at C3. So when you reduce the ketone, the product would have a new stereocenter at C3. The configuration there could be either R or S, but since the starting material is chiral, maybe the product is a single enantiomer? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the reduction is stereospecific. Wait, perhaps the reduction is not stereoselective because the ketone is planar. So the hydride can attack from either side, leading to a racemic mixture at C3. But wait, the starting material is S at C5, which is a different position. So the configuration at C3 would be a new stereocenter, which could be either R or S.

Wait, but wait, no. Since the starting material is S at C5, but C3 is a carbonyl, the reduction would create a new stereocenter at C3 with possible R or S configuration, but the starting material's configuration at C5 might influence the approach of the hydride. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product has two stereocenters: the original at C5 (S) and the new at C3 (either R or S).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the reaction again. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically gives high yields of the alcohol. When you reduce a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol. The configuration at the new stereocenter depends on the reducing agent and the reaction conditions. Since LAH is a bulky reducing agent, perhaps it leads to some selectivity, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5, the product would have two stereocenters: C3 (R or S) and C5 (S). So the molecule would be either (S,S) or (R,S) at those positions. Or wait, the C5 is a methoxy group, which is an ether, so maybe that's not a stereocenter. Wait, wait, no. The methoxy is on C5, so in the starting material, is C5 a stereocenter?

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So yes, C5 is a stereocenter because it has four different groups: the methoxy, two CH2 groups, and the adjacent carbonyl? Let me check.

Wait, C5 is attached to:

- CH(OCH3): so the groups are:

- CH2 (from C4, which is adjacent to the ketone at C3), maybe a CH2 group, but wait, the structure is: 

At C5, the substituents would be:

- A methoxy group (-OCH3),

- Two CH2 groups (from C4 and C6),

- And the OH group from the reduction? Wait, no, no, wait, the starting material is before the reduction. So in the starting material, C5 is attached to:

- A CH2 group (from C4, which is connected to the ketone at C3),

- A CH2 group (from C6, which is the end of the chain),

- A methoxy group (-OCH3),

- And what else? The C5 is connected to C4 (which is CH2-C(O)-), C6 (CH2-), and has a methoxy group. Wait, no, wait, the structure is:

Carbon 3: C=O,

Carbon 4: CH2,

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3),

Carbon 6: CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me number the carbons correctly.

Hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at C3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CO-

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3.

Wait, but the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so on carbon 5, there's a methoxy group. So, the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CO-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

Wait, but in this case, carbon 5 has:

- CH(OCH3),

- CH2 (from C4),

- CH3 (from C6),

- And a hydrogen (since it's CH). So, does that make it a stereocenter?

Yes, because four different groups: CH(OCH3), CH2-CO, CH2- (from C4), and CH3 (from C6). Wait no, the groups would be:

- OCH3 attached to C5,

- CH2 group from C4 (since C4 is a CH2 connected to the carbonyl),

- CH2 group from C6 (since C5 is connected to C6, which is CH2-CH3),

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me write the structure more clearly.

The starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH2CH3.

Wait, no, wait, if it's hexan-3-one, then carbon 3 is the carbonyl. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Oh wait, hexan is six carbons. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CO-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

So, the structure is:

CH2(CH2)2COCH(OCH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me write the full structure.

So, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3.

But with a methoxy group on carbon 5 (the fifth carbon from the end). So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CO-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

So, the fifth carbon is connected to:

- CH2 (from C4),

- CO (from C3? No, C3 is CO, so C4 is CH2 connected to C3),

- CH3 (from C6),

- OCH3 (methoxy),

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, that does make it a stereocenter because it has four different groups: CH2-CO (from C4?), CH3 (from C6), OCH3, and H. So yes, C5 is a stereocenter with configuration S.

So after the reduction, the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The ketone at C3 becomes a CHOH group. So the new structure has:

Carbon 3: CH(OH)-

And C5 remains as CH(OCH3).

Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) at C5, so the product would have a new stereocenter at C3. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with a stereocenter at C3 and another at C5. So the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5.

But wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, you get a secondary alcohol with a new stereocenter, which can be R or S. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer (S at C5), would the reduction affect the configuration at C3 in any specific way? Or would it form a racemic mixture at C3, leading to a mixture of diastereomers.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used in conditions that don't favor any particular configuration, leading to racemization. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product would have a certain configuration at C3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the configuration at C3 could be a racemic mixture, leading to two possible stereoisomers at C3, each of which would combine with the existing configuration at C5.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think again. The starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, the product will have OH at C3, which is a new stereocenter. So if the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, then the product would have two possible configurations at C3: R and S. Each of these would combine with the existing S configuration at C5, leading to a pair of diastereomers.

Wait, but no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction could be stereoselective.

Wait, perhaps the hydride attack occurs from the same face as the S configuration at C5, leading to a specific configuration at C3. But I'm not certain about the stereochemistry here. Alternatively, the reaction might lead to retention or inversion, but I think LAH tends to form alcohols without any preference, leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone with a strong agent like LAH, the attack of the hydride can be from either face, so the product would be a racemic mixture. So in Reaction I, you start with one enantiomer, and the product would have two new stereocenters: C3 and C5. So the product would have two possible stereoisomers at C3, each with the same configuration at C5.

Wait, but the starting material's configuration at C5 is S. So when the ketone is reduced, the product would have OH at C3, and the configuration at C3 would be either R or S, but since the starting material is S, perhaps the new configuration at C3 is determined based on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. LAH would reduce the ketone to the corresponding secondary alcohol, and the configuration of the new OH group would be a racemic mixture if no other factors are at play. But the presence of another stereocenter (C5) in the starting material might influence this.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer because the hydride attack is influenced by the existing configuration at C5. So the product would have a specific configuration at C3, making it a single stereoisomer. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product after reaction I is a single stereoisomer. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single diastereomer. Or perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but given that the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product ends up as a single diastereomer. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the product from Reaction I is a single compound with two stereocenters, making it a single diastereomer. So after the reduction, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has S configuration at both C3 and C5. Or perhaps the configuration at C3 is R and C5 is S.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a specific configuration because the starting material is a single enantiomer. Let me think about the structure. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So when you reduce the ketone, the hydride comes from the same face as the existing groups. For example, if the S configuration at C5 has the OCH3 group in a certain position, the hydride might attack from the same face, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a single diastereomer, giving a single peak on a chiral HPLC.

Wait, but perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer. Let me move on and think about Reaction II.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4, followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH2, I think. Structure: (CH3CO)CH2COCH3. Wait, no, wait. Pentane-2,4-dione would have two ketone groups on the same carbon chain.

Wait, pentane is five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are the ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait: 

Structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione would be:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Pentane-2,4-dione: the positions are 2 and 4.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3,

Carbon 2: C=O,

Carbon 3: CH2,

Carbon 4: C=O,

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, no, that would be four carbons between the two ketones, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, that's four carbons in total. No, wait, pentane is five carbons. So the structure must be:

CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

So positions 2 and 4 are ketones. So when treated with NaBH4, which is a weaker reducing agent compared to LAH, but in this case, it's used in excess.

Wait, but NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters or amides, but it does reduce ketones. So in pentane-2,4-dione, there are two ketones. So each would be reduced to an alcohol.

Wait, but NaBH4 is a selective reducing agent. It can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So when pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4, both ketones are reduced.

So the product would be 2,4-pentanediol. Structure: HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, the structure after reduction would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's 2,4-pentanediol. Wait, no, let me correct. The original structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3?

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be four carbons in a row with the two ketones. Let me think again.

Wait, pentane has five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are where the ketones are.

So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3,

Carbon 2: C=O,

Carbon 3: CH2,

Carbon 4: C=O,

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, that's not possible because that would be a four-carbon chain with two ketones, which isn't pentane.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

CH2=C(O)CH2C(O)CH2CH3? No, that's six carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me see: pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in a row, with ketones at positions 2 and 4.

So when reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol. Structure:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, because the original structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. So after reduction, each ketone becomes an OH group.

So the product is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain with OH groups at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, but that's the same as 2,4-pentanediol. Now, the question is about the product of Reaction II. So after treatment with excess NaBH4 and acidic workup, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, 2,4-pentanediol has two secondary alcohol groups on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, in 2,4-pentanediol, the OH groups are on C2 and C4, which are separated by two CH2 groups.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3?

No, that can't be right because that's six carbons. Wait, no, perhaps:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Yes, that's five carbons. So, it's (HOCH2)2CHCH2CH3? No, wait, that's 2,4-pentanediol. So the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's six carbons. I'm getting confused. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH3,

Carbon 2: CH(OH),

Carbon 3: CH2,

Carbon 4: CH(OH),

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that's 2 and 4 positions. So yes, 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, the question is: when pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4, which is a strong enough agent to reduce both ketones, leading to 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, does this product have any stereocenters?

Well, in 2,4-pentanediol, each OH group is on a secondary carbon (C2 and C4). So each of these carbons is a stereocenter.

Wait, C2 is connected to:

- CH3 (C1),

- OH,

- CH2 (C3),

- and another CH2 (from C3).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, C2 has:

- a CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- CH2 (from C3),

- and what else? At C2, the groups are: CH3, OH, two CH2 groups (from C3 and C1? No, perhaps not. Let me clarify.

At C2, the groups are:

- CH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- CH2- (which is connected to C3),

- and another CH2 group (from C3) or perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, if C2 is CH(OH), then the structure is CH2(OH) attached to C2, which is connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH2). So the groups at C2 are:

- CH3,

- CH2 (from C3),

- OH,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, C2 is CH(OH) connected to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH2). So the groups at C2 are:

- CH3,

- CH2 (from C3),

- OH,

- and a hydrogen.

So, four different groups: CH3, CH2 (from C3), OH, and H. Therefore, C2 is a stereocenter. Similarly, C4 is connected to:

- CH2 (from C3),

- CH(OH),

- CH3 (from C5),

- and a hydrogen.

So, C4 is also a stereocenter.

Therefore, 2,4-pentanediol has two stereocenters at C2 and C4, each with possible R and S configurations.

Now, when you reduce a diketone with NaBH4, which is a strong enough agent to reduce both ketones, but does it lead to a racemic mixture at each stereocenter, or a specific configuration?

Wait, NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, it's achiral. So when you reduce each ketone, each would form a racemic mixture. So the product would be a mixture of four possible stereoisomers: (R,R), (R,S), (S,R), and (S,S).

But wait, when you have two symmetrical ketones, would the product have fewer stereoisomers?

Wait, the original molecule pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical. Because the two ketones are in positions 2 and 4, and the molecule is symmetric around the center (C3).

So when you reduce each ketone, each forms an alcohol. But due to the symmetry, some of the stereoisomers might be the same.

Wait, let me think. If the molecule is symmetrical, then the two ketones are mirror images. So when you reduce both, the product could have stereocenters that are either both R, both S, or one R and one S. But because the molecule is symmetrical, (R,R) and (S,S) would be the same as each other because of the plane of symmetry. Similarly, (R,S) would be the same as (S,R) because of the symmetry.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, in a symmetrical molecule, if you have two stereocenters, each on symmetric positions, their configurations would lead to certain diastereomers.

Wait, for example, if both are R, that's one diastereomer. If both are S, that's another. If one is R and the other S, that's a third diastereomer. But because the molecule is symmetrical, the R,R and S,S would be enantiomers of each other, and the R,S and S,R would be the same, but wait, no, perhaps because of the symmetry, R,S and S,R are actually the same compound.

Wait, wait. Let me imagine the molecule.

The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

The two stereocenters are at C2 and C4. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through C3. So if C2 is R and C4 is R, that's one configuration. If C2 is S and C4 is S, that's another.

Alternatively, if C2 is R and C4 is S, then due to the symmetry, that's the same as C2 being S and C4 being R. So the (R,S) and (S,R) configurations would be the same because the molecule can be mirrored.

Wait, no. Because each stereocenter is in a symmetric position, the (R,S) configuration would be the same as the (S,R) configuration because the molecule is symmetrical. So the possible stereoisomers are:

1. Both R (C2 and C4 are R).

2. Both S (C2 and C4 are S).

3. One R and one S (but due to symmetry, this is a single stereoisomer).

Wait, that can't be right. Because each stereocenter is independent. So in a symmetrical molecule, if you have two stereocenters that are mirror images, then the possible stereoisomers would be:

- Both R: resulting in one stereoisomer.

- Both S: another stereoisomer (enantiomer of the first).

- One R and one S: but because of symmetry, this would be a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So in this case, the (R,S) and (S,R) configurations would be the same due to the symmetry, resulting in a single meso compound.

So the product of Reaction II is a mixture of three stereoisomers: two enantiomers (the R,R and S,S forms) and one meso form (R,S/S,R). So the product is a mixture of three possible stereoisomers.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. For a molecule with two stereocenters and a plane of symmetry, the possible diastereomers are:

- The meso compound (R,S and S,R, which are identical due to symmetry).

- The two enantiomeric forms (both R and both S).

So in total, three stereoisomers.

Wait, but wait, pentane-2,4-diol would have two stereocenters, and with the molecule being symmetrical, the number of stereoisomers would be 2^(n) where n is the number of stereocenters, but adjusted for symmetry.

In this case, n=2. So 2^2=4 possible stereoisomers. But because the molecule is symmetrical, some of these are identical.

Specifically, the (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, and the (R,S) and (S,R) are the same due to the symmetry, so they are a single compound, the meso form.

So the product from Reaction II is a mixture of three stereoisomers: two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and one meso (R,S/S,R).

But wait, when you reduce a symmetrical diketone with NaBH4, would you get all possible stereoisomers? Because NaBH4 is a non-chiral reducing agent, so each ketone would be reduced to form a racemic mixture. So each ketone's reduction would produce R and S configurations at their respective positions.

But in the case of a symmetrical molecule, the product would consist of:

- 50% (R,R),

- 50% (S,S),

- 25% (R,S),

- 25% (S,R).

But because (R,S) and (S,R) are the same due to symmetry, the mixture would be 50% (R,R + S,S) and 50% (R,S). But wait, that's not correct because (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, so they each are present in 25% each, and (R,S) is present in 50% (since R,S and S,R are the same).

Alternatively, perhaps after reduction, the product is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) and the meso compound (R,S).

Wait, but let's think about the mechanism. Each ketone is reduced independently. So for each ketone, the reduction leads to a 50:50 R and S configuration.

But because the two ketones are symmetrical, the product would have configurations that are combinations of R and S at C2 and C4.

So the possible combinations are:

1. C2 R, C4 R → (R,R)

2. C2 R, C4 S → (R,S) → which is the same as (S,R) due to symmetry → meso.

3. C2 S, C4 R → (S,R) → same as (R,S) → meso.

4. C2 S, C4 S → (S,S)

So each of the four possible combinations is equally likely, but (R,S) and (S,R) are the same, so the product is a mixture of three compounds: (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) (meso).

But wait, considering that the reduction is done in excess NaBH4, perhaps all the ketones are reduced, but the stereochemistry is a mixture. So the product would be a 25% (R,R), 25% (S,S), and 50% (R,S) (meso).

Wait, but let me think about this. Each reduction of a ketone leads to a 50:50 R and S configuration. So for each ketone, the chance is 50% R and 50% S.

The combinations would be:

- Both R: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%

- Both S: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%

- R and S: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%

- S and R: 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%

But due to symmetry, R and S is the same as S and R, so the total for (R,S) is 50%.

So the product is 25% (R,R), 25% (S,S), and 50% (R,S).

So, in Reaction II, the product is a mixture of three stereoisomers: two enantiomers (each 25%) and the meso form (50%).

But wait, the meso form is a single compound, so when you run it on a chiral HPLC, it would appear as a single peak, while the enantiomers would each give a peak. So in total, three peaks on a chiral column.

Wait, but wait. If the product is a racemic mixture of (R,R) and (S,S) plus the meso form, then when run on a chiral HPLC, the (R,R) and (S,S) would be enantiomers and elute as two separate peaks. The meso form, being achiral, would elute as a single peak because it's not separated by the chiral column. So in total, three peaks: two from the enantiomers and one from the meso.

But wait, no. The meso form is achiral, so on a chiral column, it would not be separated. So it would appear as a single peak, while the enantiomers would be two separate peaks. So Reaction II's product gives three peaks on a chiral HPLC.

Wait, no, no. The (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, so they would be separated into two peaks on a chiral column. The meso form would be a single peak because it's not chiral. So in total, three peaks.

But wait, if the meso form is present in the product, and the other two are enantiomers, then yes, three peaks.

Now, combining the products from both reactions.

Reaction I: product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let me think about its structure again. After reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So let's consider whether this product has any stereocenters.

Wait, earlier I thought that Reaction I's product has two stereocenters: C3 (from reduction) and C5 (from starting material). But wait, the starting material's C5 was a stereocenter with S configuration, and after reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So the product would have two stereocenters, making it a diastereomer with possible four stereoisomers. But wait, if the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, then the product would have two stereocenters, leading to four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer.

Wait, maybe the product is a single diastereomer because the starting material's configuration at C5 affects the attack of the hydride at C3, leading to a specific configuration at C3. So the product would be a single stereoisomer with two stereocenters.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the product after Reaction I is a single stereoisomer because the starting material's configuration leads to a specific configuration at C3 upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but the starting material's configuration makes that the product has two stereocenters. So in any case, the product of Reaction I would be a single diastereomer, leading to a single peak on a chiral column.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH. The ketone is at C3, and the starting material is S at C5.

When the ketone is reduced, the OH is added to C3. The configuration at C3 would depend on the approach of the hydride. Since the starting material is chiral, perhaps the product's configuration at C3 is determined in a way that leads to a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, LAH is a strong reducing agent that leads to the formation of the most stable alcohol, which might lead to a specific configuration at C3.

But perhaps, regardless of the starting material, the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, giving a product with two stereocenters (C3 and C5). So the product would be a diastereomeric mixture of four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps only two diastereomers are formed, each with a specific configuration.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Let's assume that Reaction I gives a single stereoisomer. So the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters.

Then, the products from both reactions are combined.

So, product from I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two stereocenters → single compound (assuming only one diastereomer is formed).

Product from II: 2,4-pentanediol with three stereoisomers (25% R,R; 25% S,S; 50% R,S (meso)).

Wait, no, in Reaction II, the product is a mixture of three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) (meso). So when the products from I and II are combined, the total mixture includes:

From I: 1 compound (single stereoisomer?).

From II: three stereoisomers.

So when run on a chiral HPLC, each stereoisomer would give a separate peak. So the total number of peaks would be 1 (from I) + 3 (from II) = 4 peaks on chiral HPLC.

But wait, the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two stereocenters. So on a chiral HPLC, it would appear as a single peak because it's a single compound. The product from Reaction II has three stereoisomers. So in the combined mixture, there are 1 + 3 =4 stereoisomers.

Wait, no. Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer, so one peak on chiral HPLC. Reaction II's product has three stereoisomers: two enantiomers (each giving a peak) and one meso (giving one peak). So Reaction II contributes three peaks. So combined, they have 1 (from I) +3 (from II) =4 peaks on chiral HPLC.

Now, what about the normal-phase HPLC?

Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity, typically separating compounds based on their elution strength. The number of peaks here depends on the number of distinct compounds, regardless of their chirality.

So, how many distinct compounds are in the combined product?

From Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a single compound.

From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol. But the product is a mixture of three stereoisomers (two enantiomers and one meso). But in terms of structure, all are 2,4-pentanediol, so they would elute as a single peak on normal-phase HPLC because the column doesn't distinguish between stereoisomers.

Wait, no. On normal-phase HPLC, all stereoisomers of the same compound would have the same retention time because the column doesn't separate enantiomers or diastereomers. So from Reaction II, all three stereoisomers are the same compound, 2,4-pentanediol, so they would appear as a single peak.

So, the combined products are:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1 compound, one peak on normal-phase HPLC).

- 2,4-pentanediol (1 compound, one peak on normal-phase HPLC).

So in total, two peaks on normal-phase HPLC.

So, the chiral HPLC would show four peaks, and the normal-phase would show two peaks.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → No, I thought 4 and 2.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → No, I thought 4 and 2.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC → Yes.

D) 3 peaks in both → No.

So the answer would be option C: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.


To determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms, we analyze the products of the two reactions and their behavior on both chiral and normal-phase HPLC columns.

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup  
- The starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5.  
- LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.  
- The reduction introduces a new stereocenter at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer (S configuration at C5), the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters (C3 and C5).  
- On a chiral HPLC, this product appears as a single peak because it is a single stereoisomer.  
- On a normal-phase HPLC, all stereoisomers of the same compound elute at the same retention time, so this product also appears as a single peak.

  1. **(R,R)** and **(S,S)**: Enantiomers, each appearing as separate peaks on a chiral HPLC.  
  2. **(R,S)** and **(S,R)**: Identical due to symmetry, forming a single meso compound that appears as one peak on a chiral HPLC.  
- On a chiral HPLC, the three stereoisomers (two enantiomers and one meso compound) produce three peaks.
