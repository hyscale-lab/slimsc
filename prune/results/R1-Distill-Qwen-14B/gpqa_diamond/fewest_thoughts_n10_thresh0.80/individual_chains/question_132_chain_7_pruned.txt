Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me read the question carefully again.

The problem says that a solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different pairs of compounds, and I need to figure out which pair is correct.

Hmm, let's break this down. The molecular formula is C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees, which likely means one benzene ring (3 degrees) plus one double bond or a ring, but since it's an aromatic compound, probably a benzene with substituents.

Looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except one option which is diethyl. Wait, let's check each option.

Wait, the options are:
A) 1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzenes
B) 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-
C) 1,2,3,5- and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-

Wait, let me think. The first part is about the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm). Since the solution is a 1:1 mixture, two singlets suggests that each compound has one type of aromatic proton environment, and the other compound contributes the other singlet.

Wait, more accurately, if each compound in the mixture contributes a certain number of aromatic protons, but the NMR shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but each compound might have multiple equivalent aromatic protons. Let me think about the substitution patterns.

Option C includes 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, 1,4-diethyl would have a benzene ring with two ethyl groups attached at positions 1 and 4. For the aromatic protons, if the substitution is such that all the remaining hydrogen are equivalent, then each compound's aromatic region would show a singlet.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. In a para-substituted benzene, if you have two substituents, say ethyl groups at para positions, the remaining positions are ortho and meta. But wait, 1,4-diethyl would have two ethyl groups opposite each other. The other positions (2,3,5,6) are all ortho and meta to each substituent. But in such a case, are the aromatic protons equivalent?

Wait, for 1,4-diethylbenzene, the structure would be two ethyl groups opposite each other on the benzene. So the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Are the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent? Similarly, 3 and 5. Because of the symmetry, the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent. So the aromatic region would have two sets of protons. But wait, the NMR in the question only shows two singlets in the aromatic region, each as a singlet. So if a compound has two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, it would show two signals. But that's in the aromatic region. Wait, but the question says two singlets at 6.7 ppm each, in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the mixture, each compound would contribute their own signals. If each compound has only one type of aromatic proton (i.e., all equivalent), then each would give a singlet. So if in the mixture, you have two compounds each with a singlet in the aromatic region, then the NMR would show two singlets, each integrating for the number of protons in each compound.

But the problem states that the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, each compound contributes equally. So each aromatic singlet must have the same number of protons. Or not? Wait, the integration ratio is 1:1 for the two signals. So each aromatic signal has the same number of protons.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose each compound has some aromatic protons. If each contributes a singlet, and the ratio of the integrals is 1:1, that would mean each compound has the same number of aromatic protons. Or perhaps each has the same number of protons in their respective singlets.

Looking at the options, let's consider each pair:

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

Wait, the first compound, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the substituents are in positions 1,2,4,5. Let me draw the benzene ring. Positions 1,2,4,5 are substituted. So substituents are at adjacent positions (1 and 2), then 4 and 5 are adjacent. So the structure would have substituents at ortho positions and another pair of ortho positions across the ring, maybe.

Wait, but the positions are 1,2,4,5: that's like a 1,2-dimethyl and 4,5-dimethyl on a benzene. So the structure might be symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of equivalent protons.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So the remaining positions are 3 and 6. Are the protons at 3 and 6 equivalent?

Wait, in this structure, the ring is symmetric. Let me imagine the structure: substituents at 1 and 2, and 4 and 5. So, the ring has a substituent every other position, but in such a
