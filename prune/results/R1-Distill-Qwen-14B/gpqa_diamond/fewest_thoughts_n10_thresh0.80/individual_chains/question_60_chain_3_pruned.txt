Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation, right? Oh right, because when you travel at a high speed, especially close to the speed of light, time works differently.

So the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They built a super fast spacecraft that travels at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years, which is 150 years. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip would take from their perspective.

Wait, the question says from the astronaut's point of view. So this is about the proper time, right? Because proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference, which in this case is the astronaut's ship.

First, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I recall that the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and it's about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is roughly 163,000 light-years. 

But wait, the problem says "approximately," so maybe I can round that. Let's say about 163,000 light-years for the distance (d).

The spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. That's extremely close to the speed of light. So we'll need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time.

In special relativity, the relationship between proper time (τ) and the coordinate time (t) is given by the time dilation formula:

τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

But wait, to find τ, I probably need to relate it to the distance and the speed as observed from Earth. Or wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the distance and speed as measured in the ship's frame.

Wait, no. Let me think again. From the Earth's frame, the distance is 163,000 light-years, and the speed is v. So the time it takes
