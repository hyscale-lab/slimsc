Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's see. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that maybe. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options given are A to D, with some numbers in exponents.

Wait, okay. So, since the system is isolated, I think the energy here refers to the electrostatic potential energy between the charges. Because potential energy in an isolated system can't be zero unless all the charges are infinitely apart, which isn't the case here.

So, I remember that the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But in a system with multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh wait, right, because each pair contributes.

So, the setup here is that the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from the central charge, and each of them is also a certain distance away from each other.

Wait, but the problem says they are "constrained to stay at 2 m from P." So, their positions are all on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But since each has negligible mass, perhaps the exact positions relative to each other don't matter for the energy calculation? Or maybe they do because the distance between them affects their mutual potential energy.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are all on a sphere of radius 2 m. But each of them is a point charge, so the distance between any two of them will be the chord length of that sphere. Hmm, but perhaps I need to calculate both the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, the problem says it's the minimum energy. So maybe I'm supposed
