Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should break this down into steps. Let me outline the steps I need to take.

Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution with water.
Step 2: Determine the equivalence point volume of NaOH needed.
Step 3: Find the pH at 25% of the equivalence point.
Step 4: Determine the pH at the equivalence point.

Let me start with step 1. 

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters.

The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2.

M2 = (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, that makes sense because when you double the volume, the concentration halves. 0.05 to 0.025, yes.

Now, step 2: equivalence point. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

So moles of NaOH needed at equivalence = 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so Volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, so the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of that volume would be 2.5 cm³ added.

Wait, no. Wait, in the titration, the 25% would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, let me think about that. The total volume needed is 10 cm³ for equivalence. So 25% of that would be 2.5 cm³. So I need to calculate the pH when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to approach each part step by step.

First, for the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added.

Moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After adding NaOH, some of the acetic acid will have been neutralized to acetate ions.

Reaction: CH3COOH + OH^- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining = initial moles - moles NaOH added = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed = 0.00025 mol.

So now, the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

But first, what's the total volume of the solution at 25% titration?

We have the original 40 cm³ (20+20) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

Concentration of CH3COOH is 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate is 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Alternatively, using the ratio of the concentrations in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log ( [A^-]/[HA] )

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.732.
