Alright, I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let's try to work through it step by step. So, the scenario is about a chemically synthesized small peptidic compound. The NMR and LC-MS analyses are showing some unexpected peaks. Hmm, what could be going on?

Okay, let's parse the question. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except for two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, something is causing a split in the signal for that proton. But the coupling pattern isn't an issueâ€”so it's not spin-spin coupling. Wait, why wouldn't it be coupling? Maybe because the coupling would lead to more complex splitting, but in this case, the integrals add up to 1H.

Then there's the LC-MS analysis. They ran it at elevated temperature and saw two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So, the same molecular weight but two separate peaks. That suggests maybe two different species with the same mass but different structures. Oh wait, but same mass and same molecular formula would mean they're either enantiomers, diastereomers, or maybe something else.

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have a lower mass. But the question says both LC-MS peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule. So A is probably not it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular mass and their NMR would show the same because they're mirror images. But in NMR, if it's a racemic mixture, the signals might not split because the environments are identical for each enantiomer. Unless... wait, but in the NMR, the alpha-proton is showing two peaks. Enantiomers would have the same NMR signals because they have the same environment. Unless there's some diastereotopicity? Not sure. But they ruled out coupling as the reason, so maybe it's not enantiomers.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, not sure what that term means. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, like in an EDC coupling or something, perhaps some side product forms. But wait, if it's a coupling issue, would that lead to two separate molecules? Or maybe some residual starting material? Or maybe some other byproduct. But LC-MS shows the same mass, so it's not a different mass.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC-MS. Their NMR signals would split because the environments are different. So for the alpha-proton, each diastereomer would have their own set of protons. So each would have a peak for the alpha proton, but the shifts might be similar if the environments are almost the same. Wait, but the integral adds to 1H. So each diastereomer would have one alpha proton each, but their signals are overlapping or something?

Wait, the N
