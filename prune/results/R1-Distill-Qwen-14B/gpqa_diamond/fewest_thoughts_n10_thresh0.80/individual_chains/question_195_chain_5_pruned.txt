Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, we need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, so bigger than the first. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

The key here is that the second planet should exhibit both transit and occultation events. Hmm, transits happen when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, and we don't see its light anymore. For both events to occur, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that its orbital period is longer than the first's because if it were shorter, it would just lap the first planet and maybe not align for both events every time.

Wait, but how do their orbital periods relate? Oh, right, in order for both transits and occultations to occur, the second planet must be farther from the star than the first. Because if it's closer, it would orbit faster (due to Kepler's laws), so it would lap the first planet, and the alignment for transits would happen more often. But for occultation, I think the second planet has to be the one that can pass behind the star as seen from Earth, which requires that at least once per orbit, it's on the far side. So the orbital periods must be such that their orbital periods are in a ratio that allows for mutual events.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Hill sphere or orbital resonances. Or perhaps more straightforwardly, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that it's in a 2:1 resonance with the first, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's about the time between when the first planet transits, and the second planet would be in a position to both transit and be occulted.

Wait, another approach: For a planet to transit, the planet's orbital plane must be aligned such that it crosses our line of sight to the star. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star from our perspective. So the orbital periods must be such that the second planet's orbit is longer than the first's, so that it doesn't lap the first planet too quickly, allowing both events to happen.

Wait, the problem states that the second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, to have a transit, the planet must pass in front of the star, and to have an occultation, it must pass behind. For both to happen, the orbital period of the second must not be such that it's in a 1:1 resonance, because then it would always be opposite or something. Hmm, perhaps it's more about the duration and when the events happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the second planet's orbital period must be such that the orbital period is such that the two planets can both line up for transits and
