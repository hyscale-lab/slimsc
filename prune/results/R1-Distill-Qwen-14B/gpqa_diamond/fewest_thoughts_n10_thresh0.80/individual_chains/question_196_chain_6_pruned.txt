Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point, usually because of a restoring force like Hooke's law. But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess I can't just use the classical formulas here because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me read the details again. The mass is m, maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. Oh, right, Hooke's law is F equals negative k times displacement x.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA², and this converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0). So the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so that's probably not the answer here because at high speeds, you have to consider gamma and all that.

So I have to think about relativistic energy. The total energy in relativity is gamma times mc². But for a harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but maybe that's not relevant here; the question is about maximum speed, so perhaps we're treating it classically but considering the relativistic expressions.

Wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy
