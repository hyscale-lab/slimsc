Okay, so I've got this problem where a chemist found an unknown white solid, and I need to figure out what it is based on the spectral data provided. Let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%. The other peak at 158 is 32%. I'm thinking maybe this is a molecular ion with some kind of isotopic peak. Chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope (about 75% for Cl-35 and 25% for Cl-37). So a molecular formula with Cl might show two peaks differing by 2 (since Cl-35 and Cl-37 have a mass difference of 2). The molecular ion is at 156, and the 158 peak is 32%, which is about a third. Hmm, 32% is roughly 32% of the total being Cl-37. Wait, but if the molecule has one Cl atom, the isotopic peaks would be at m/z 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37). The intensities would be approximately 75% and 25% of the molecular ion. So in the mass spec, the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), but the 158 peak is 32%, which is about (25% * 100%) / 75% = approx 33%. Wait, maybe that's how it works. So that suggests that the molecular formula includes one Cl and the molecular weight is 156 (since Cl-35 is 35). So if the molecular weight is 156, but the Cl is 35, then the rest is 121. Let me think about that.

The IR shows a broad peak between 3500 and 2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But since the NMR shows some peaks, maybe it's O-H. But let me check the other peaks. There's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). So 1720 is in the range for a carboxylic acid (maybe higher), or an ester, or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes are around 1700-1720, but carboxylic acids are usually lower since they're hydrogen-bonded, maybe around 1700 but can vary. But wait, benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1720. So the 1720 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester?

Looking at the 1H NMR: There's a peak at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H). That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes can be higher. Wait, but 11 is very high. Carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. But then why is it a singlet? Or maybe it's a phenolic OH, but that's usually a broad peak, but in the problem, the IR mentions a broad peak, but the NMR shows a singlet. Wait, the NMR shows 11.0 as a singlet, which is more in line with a carboxylic acid's -COOH proton. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding, but in D2O or if it's exchange broadened, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, 11 ppm is a bit high for an aldehyde, which is typically around 9-10. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, the NMR also shows 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split each other into doublets. So the coupling would be between two protons on adjacent carbons, but in para positions, each H is coupled with the H on the opposite carbon, leading to a doublet. So the two doublets are likely the two sets of protons on the benzene ring, perhaps ortho to substituents.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a substituent that has a carbonyl group. Let's consider the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure: Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at position 1. Wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The NMR would show the aromatic protons. If the aldehyde is at position 1, then the substituents are in positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). Wait, but in that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 4 and 6. So the protons at 4 and 6 would be equivalent because of the substituents. The aromatic protons would be two doublets if they're adjacent
