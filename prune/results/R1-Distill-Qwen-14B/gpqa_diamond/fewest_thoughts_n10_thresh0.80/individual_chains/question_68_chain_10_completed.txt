Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Oh wait, right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. 

The situation is that the magnetic field is initially pointing along the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, it's turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. After this change, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is about finding the oscillation frequency.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field direction changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B, right? But wait, I think the actual formula is H = -γ S · B, but wait, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma S_z. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is usually given by mu = gamma S, where S is the spin angular momentum operator. So in that case, the Hamiltonian H would be proportional to S·B, but with a negative sign because the energy is lower when the moment is aligned with the field. So H = - mu · B = -gamma (S · B). But wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Wait, the question states mu equals gamma times S_z. Oh, so mu isn't in the direction of the spin vector, but specifically in the z-component. Hmm, that's a bit different. So maybe the magnetic moment is quantized along the z-axis? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, maybe mu is the magnitude, but then it would be mu = gamma times the component in the direction of the magnetic field. Hmm, the question says mu equals gamma S_z, so perhaps when the magnetic field is along the z-direction, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. But when the field is in the y-direction, the magnetic moment would involve S_y? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the initial state is such that the spin is aligned along the z-axis, and then the field changes to y, causing the spin to precess.

Wait, the spin is initially aligned with the magnetic field, which is along +Z. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Then the magnetic field is turned off along Z and turned on along Y. So the Hamiltonian after the switch would be H = - mu · B', where B' is along Y. But since mu is given as gamma S_z, then H would be - gamma S_z times B in the Y direction? Wait, no, because the magnetic field is along Y, the dot product would involve S_y, right? Because H = -gamma (S · B), and if B is along Y, then mu = gamma S_z is more confusing.

Wait, perhaps I got the definition wrong. Let me re-read the question. It says mu equals gamma S_z, so mu is a vector with only the z-component. Hmm, that seems a bit off because in a magnetic field, the magnetic moment would align with the field direction. But if the magnetic moment is only along z, then when the field is along Y, the interaction would be different.

Wait, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S, the vector. Oh, but the question says "mu = gamma * S_z", which is a scalar? Wait no, S_z is an operator, so mu would be a vector operator. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe mu is the magnitude, but that would be mu = gamma sqrt(S(S+1) ħ^2), but that's a different expression.

Wait, perhaps the question is using mu as a vector where each component is gamma times the corresponding spin component. So mu = gamma S_x x-hat + gamma S_y y-hat + gamma S_z z-hat. So the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. If that's the case, then when the magnetic field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = -gamma B S_z. Then when the field is turned off and turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but that's a possibility. So initially, the Hamiltonian was H1 = -gamma B S_z. The eigenstates of this are |+z> and |-z>. The system is in an eigenstate of S_z, so its energy is definite.

After the field is changed to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H2 = -gamma B S_y. Because S_y and S_z don't commute, the state will no longer be an eigenstate of H2. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the moment. The average of the z-component, <mu_z>, which is gamma times <S_z>, so we can focus on <S_z> oscillations.

The time evolution of the state is determined by the new Hamiltonian. So let's model this. The initial state is |+z>, since the particle's moment is aligned with the initial magnetic field along Z. After the field is turned to Y, the state evolves under H2.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H2 t / ħ). So H2 is proportional to S_y.

H2 = - gamma B S_y. Let me write H = (gamma B) S_y times a negative sign, so H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the actual expression would be H = - mu · B, and since mu is gamma S, when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y. So yes, H = -gamma B S_y.

The energy eigenstates of H will be the eigenstates of S_y. The initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

Let me write |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, actually, wait. The exact expressions depend on the phase. Alternatively, it's:

|+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|+z> + i |−z> )

Wait, maybe I should check the formulas. The eigenstates of S_y are given by:

S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>

Expressed in the |+z>, |-z> basis:

|+y> = (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

Similarly,

|-y> = (|+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

But I might have the signs and i's wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + |-z> ), but that can't be right because S_y is Hermitian, so the eigenstates must be orthogonal. Let's not get too bogged down here; perhaps I can proceed without the exact coefficients.

The initial state is |psi(0)> = |+z> .

Expressed in the eigenbasis of H (which is S_y), the state can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y> with certain coefficients.

The time evolution under H will cause the state to precess, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The time evolution of |psi(t)> is given by:

|psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |psi(0)>

But H is proportional to S_y, so we can write:

H = ω S_y, where ω is the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. Because H = - gamma B S_y, so ω = gamma B, but perhaps with a negative sign. Wait, let's define H as H = - gamma B S_y.

But in any case, the time evolution operator is:

U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B) S_y t / ħ )

Wait, let me compute H in terms of angular frequency. The spin precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. So perhaps H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the energy levels are E = - gamma B ( ± ħ/2 ) = ± ( - gamma B ħ / 2 )? Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting signs wrong. Let me think again.

The Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, and B is along y, H becomes H = -gamma B S_y.

So H |+y> = - gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> ?

Wait, the eigenvalue for S_y |+y> is ħ/2, so H |+y> = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ) |+y> → E = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2 for the |+y> state, and E = (gamma B ħ ) / 2 for the |-y> state?

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when the magnetic field is along y, the energy should depend on the spin in the y-direction. But regardless, the point is that the time evolution will cause the state to oscillate between the |+y> and |-y> states.

The state |psi(t)> will be a superposition of |+y> and |-y> with time-dependent phases.

The expectation value of S_z (and hence mu_z) will oscillate sinusoidally because of this superposition.

The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the two eigenstates.

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = [ (-gamma B ħ / 2 ) ] - [ (+gamma B ħ / 2 ) ] = -gamma B ħ.

Wait, no. Wait, H |+y> = - gamma B ( ħ/2 ) |+y>, so E_+ is -gamma B ( ħ/2 ), and H |-y> = gamma B ( ħ/2 ) |-y>, so E_- is +gamma B ( ħ/2 ).

So the energy difference is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) - (gamma B ħ/2 ) )= - gamma B ħ.

Wait, but the energy difference between the two states is [E_+ - E_-] = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) - (gamma B ħ/2 ) )= - gamma B ħ.

But the frequency is given by (E_+ - E_-) / ħ, which is (-gamma B ħ ) / ħ = - gamma B. However, the oscillation frequency is the magnitude, so the absolute value, so gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The time evolution of the expectation value is determined by the difference between the phases of the two states. The general formula for the expectation value of an observable O is given by:

< O(t) > = < psi(0) | exp(i H t / ħ ) O exp(-i H t / ħ ) | psi(0) >.

But in this case, the initial state is |+z>, and we're looking for <S_z>.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to compute the time dependence of <S_z>.

The state can be written as |psi(t)> = a |+y> exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) + b |−y> exp( -i E_- t / ħ )

Since the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed in terms of |+y> and |−y>:

|+z> = ( |+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2 ), assuming the coefficients don't have i's, but perhaps it's with a factor of i. Wait, earlier I thought |+y> is (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 ), but that's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express |+z> in the |+y> and |-y> basis.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the coefficients a and b.

We have |+z> = ( |+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2 ) ?

Wait, no. Let's think about the exact expression. Because |+y> is (|+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 ), then |+z> can be written as |+y> - i |−y> all over sqrt(2 ).

Wait, let's see:

|+y> = ( |+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )
|−y> = ( |+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )

So solving for |+z>:

|+z> = |+y> + i |−y> ?

Wait, let me compute:

Add the two equations:

|+y> + |−y> = [ |+z> + i |-z> + |+z> - i |-z> ] / sqrt(2 )
= [ 2 |+z> ] / sqrt(2 )
=> |+z> = ( |+y> + |−y> ) * sqrt(2)/2 * 2 ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try inverting the equations.

Let me write:

|+y> = ( |+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )

|−y> = ( |+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )

If I add these two equations:

|+y> + |−y> = (2 |+z> ) / sqrt(2 )

So |+z> = ( |+y> + |−y> ) * sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write |+z> as (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2 ), but that doesn't include the i. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is written as a linear combination of |+y> and |−y> with coefficients 1/sqrt(2) each, but I'm not sure about the phases.

But perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact coefficients. Let me assume that |+z> can be written as ( |+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2 ), which might not be correct, but perhaps it's a starting point.

Then, the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = ( |+y> exp( -i E_+ t/ħ ) + |−y> exp( -i E_- t/ħ ) ) / sqrt(2 )

The expectation value <S_z> would then be:

= [ < +z | psi(t) > ]^* [ S_z psi(t) ] ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute <S_z> directly.

Wait, S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2) |-z>.

The expectation value <S_z> is the expectation of the operator S_z in the state |psi(t)>.

So:

<S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>

But |psi(t)> is the evolved state. Let's compute this.

But perhaps it's easier to note that the time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y will cause the spin state to precess around the Y-axis. The frequency of precession is determined by the energy difference between the states.

The energy levels are E_+ = (-gamma B)(ħ/2 ), E_- = (+gamma B)( ħ/2 )

The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B (ħ/2 )) - (gamma B ( ħ/2 )) ) = - gamma B ħ.

The oscillation frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (- gamma B ) * ( ħ ) / ħ = - gamma B.

But since frequency is positive, it's gamma B. But wait, that's just the Larmor frequency. But wait, in the previous step, the energy difference is (E_+ - E_- ) = - gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = - gamma B.

Wait, but the oscillation frequency is the magnitude, so it's gamma B.

But when the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates, the time evolution causes the phase difference between them, leading to oscillations in expectation values. The frequency of these oscillations is given by (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ.

Wait, but in this case, the energy difference is (E_+ - E_- ) = (-gamma B ( ħ/2 )) - (gamma B ( ħ/2 )) ) = - gamma B ħ.

So the difference is - gamma B ħ. Then, the frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = - gamma B. The negative sign indicates the direction of rotation, but the magnitude is gamma B.

So the average of the z-component's moment, which is proportional to <S_z>, oscillates at this frequency.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is gamma B, option D is gamma B / sqrt(2). Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the initial state. Let me double-check.

The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field changes to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y, so the state evolves in time.

The expectation value of S_z will oscillate because the state is a superposition of eigenstates of S_y, which have different S_z components.

The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy splitting between the two states. The energy difference is 2*(gamma B * ħ/2 ) = gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking back at the options, option B is gamma B.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, the vector, so mu_z = gamma S_z. So the average of mu_z is gamma times the average of S_z. So the frequency would still be gamma B.

Wait, but looking for the average of the z-component of mu: mu_z = gamma <S_z>.

But the time dependence of <S_z> would be the same as before, so the frequency is gamma B.

Alternatively, perhaps the precession frequency is omega = gamma B, but the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is 2 omega?

Wait, what's the time dependence of <S_z>? Let's think in terms of Rabi oscillations.

When a spin is subjected to a magnetic field, the expectation value of the spin component in the direction perpendicular to the field oscillates with frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state is along Z, and the field is turned to Y. So the spin precesses around the Y-axis, causing the expectation values of S_x and S_z to oscillate. The oscillation frequency in this case is the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B.

So the average of <S_z> (and thus mu_z) oscillates at a frequency of gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The Larmor frequency is the frequency of precession, which is indeed gamma B.

So the correct answer should be option B, gamma B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment **μ = γS_z**, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude **B**. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, **⟨μ_z⟩**.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of **S_z**, corresponding to the magnetic field along +Z. The Hamiltonian for the system is given by **H = -μ·B**, where the magnetic moment **μ = γS** (a vector proportional to the spin). When the magnetic field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is **H₁ = -γB S_z**. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of **S_z**.

2. **Change in Magnetic Field**:  
   When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes **H₂ = -γB S_y**. The eigenstates of **H₂** are now the eigenstates of **S_y**, denoted as **|+y⟩** and **|-y⟩**. These are superpositions of the original **|+z⟩** and **|-z⟩** states:
   \[
   |+y⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z⟩ + i|-z⟩), \quad |-y⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z⟩ - i|-z⟩).
   \]

3. **Time Evolution and Oscillations**:  
   The initial state **|+z⟩** is no longer an eigenstate of **H₂** after the magnetic field is switched. The state evolves over time as a superposition of **|+y⟩** and **|-y⟩**, with time-dependent phases determined by the energy eigenvalues of **H₂**. The energy eigenvalues are:
   \[
   E_+ = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}, \quad E_- = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}.
   \]
   The energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E = E_+ - E_- = -\gamma B \hbar.
   \]
   The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference:
   \[
   f = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \gamma B.
   \]

4. **Oscillation of ⟨μ_z⟩**:  
   The z-component of the magnetic moment is **μ_z = γS_z**. The expectation value **⟨μ_z⟩** oscillates due to the time evolution of the state, with a frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, which is **γB**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (γB/2)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of 2.
- **Option B (γB)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency matches the Larmor frequency derived above.
- **Option C (√2 γB)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of √2 in the oscillation frequency.
- **Option D (γB/√2)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of √2.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is **γB**.

**Answer: B**
