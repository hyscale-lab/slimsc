Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X.

The given data are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

I remember that the mean decay distance of a particle is related to its lifetime and velocity. Oh wait, right! The formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma times beta, but wait, let me get that straight. The mean proper lifetime (tau) is h-bar over the width (Γ), because the width is the inverse of the lifetime. So tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is the decay width. 

Wait, no, actually, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the energy width, and the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, so Δt is about ħ/(ΔE), and Γ is the uncertainty in energy. So yeah, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But then, the mean decay length is speed times lifetime. Oh, but the lifetime we just wrote is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So the actual lifetime observed is gamma times tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the total time is gamma tau. And then multiply by the velocity beta times the speed of light, so the distance L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Putting it all together: L = (gamma beta c) * (ħ / Γ). 

Wait, but gamma beta can be written as (E / m c²) * (p c / E) ), because E = gamma m c² and p = gamma m v, so beta is v/c = (p c)/(gamma m c²). Hmm, perhaps there's a more straightforward way.

Wait another approach: the decay length is given by L = (c * tau) * gamma * beta. Because tau is the proper lifetime, so the observed lifetime is gamma tau, and the velocity is beta c, so distance is (gamma tau) * beta c. So L = gamma beta c tau
