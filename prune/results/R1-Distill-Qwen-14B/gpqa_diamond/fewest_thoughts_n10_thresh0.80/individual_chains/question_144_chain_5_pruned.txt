Okay, I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about meson resonance decay, and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with various distances in meters, so the answer should be in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or mean proper decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βγ, since for relativistic particles, the gamma factor is significant). But wait, the proper lifetime τ is the mean lifetime, which is related to the decay width Γ. Oh right, the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But since these are high energy particles, the units might be tricky.

So step by step. First, I need to calculate the lifetime τ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s, right? Because I remember that ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.
