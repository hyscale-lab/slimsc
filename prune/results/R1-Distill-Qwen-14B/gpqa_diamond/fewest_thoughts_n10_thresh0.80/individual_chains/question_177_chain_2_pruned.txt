Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. We're supposed to compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm, so first, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars are black bodies, that should apply here.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

So, going back to Luminosity, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since T is the same for both stars, the luminosity depends on the radius squared.

Star_1 has radius R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1 is 1.5 times R2.

So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴ = 4π R2² σ T⁴ * (1.5)^2.

Which is 1.5 squared times L2, because L2 is 4π R2² σ T⁴.

Calculating 1.5 squared: 1.5 * 1.5 is 2.25. So
