Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about some mixtures undergoing reactions, and we need to find the number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Hmm. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Right, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, when a liquid decolorizes bromine water, that usually means it has double bonds because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine. Since it's a mixture, each component probably has a double bond.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes some reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, so if Y doesn't react with bromine, that suggests that the double bonds in X were hydrogenated or something similar. Oh, because if you hydrogenate alkenes, you get alkanes, which don't have double bonds and thus wouldn't decolorize bromine water. So maybe X underwent hydrogenation to form Y? But the problem says it's a result of a disproportionation reaction. Hmm.

Wait, what's a disproportionation reaction? That's when a substance is both oxidized and reduced. So in X, perhaps one of the components is getting hydrogenated (adding H2, which is a reduction) and another is getting dehydrogenated (losing H2, which is oxidation). But wait, if X has two liquids, and Y has two other liquids, maybe each component in X is undergoing a change. For example, maybe one is adding H2 and another is losing it. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance, Z. And Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. That fraction sounds familiar. Let me calculate what that implies.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So if the molecular weight is 100g/mol (just an example), the hydrogen would be 14.28g, so the number of H atoms would be (14.28/1)/(1.008) ≈14. Let me see, 14.28 is exactly 1/7 of 100, so maybe the molecular formula is such that the hydrogen contributes 1/7 of the mass.

Wait, let's calculate it more accurately. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is 0.1428. That's approximately 1/7 because 1/7 is about 0.142857. So, if the molecular formula is such that the sum of all atoms' masses equals the mass, and H contributes 1/7, then:

Assume the formula is CnH2m.

Wait, maybe it's ethylene or something similar. Let me think. Let me find the molecular formula for Z.

Let’s denote the molecular formula as CnH2m.

The mass of H is (2m * 1.008)/(12n + 2m *1.008) ) = 0.1428.

Let me set up the equation: (2m *
