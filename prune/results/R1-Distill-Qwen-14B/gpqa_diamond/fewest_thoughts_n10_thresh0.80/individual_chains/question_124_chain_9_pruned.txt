Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector, producing new particles that decay quickly. These new particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. 

The problem states that, on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. But the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two thirds of them reach the walls? The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is equal to E/(m cÂ²), and it's also related to time dilation and length contraction. But in this context, I think it's about how far a particle travels before decaying. Because the decay time would affect whether it reaches the detector's wall or not.

Let me think. The particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius, which is 30 meters. But if they decay quickly, only some of them make it to the wall. The fraction that reach the wall depends on how long they live, which depends on their speed (Lorentz factor) because of time dilation.

In the lab frame, the lifetime of the particle is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So the lifetime in the lab is tau * gamma. The distance the particle travels before decaying is its speed multiplied by its lifetime. Since speed at ultra-relativistic speeds is approximately c, the distance is approximately c * tau * gamma.

But wait, the particles are produced at the center, so the distance to the wall is 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the wall, the distance it travels, which is v * t, must be at least 30 meters. But since v is close to c, maybe we can approximate v as c. So the condition is c * tau * gamma >= 30 meters.

But wait, the fraction that reach the wall depends on whether the particle's lifetime is sufficient for it to reach the wall. So the probability P that a particle decays before reaching the wall is equal to 1 minus the exponential decay probability. Alternatively, the number of particles that reach the wall is related to the mean decay length compared to the detector's radius.

Wait, the problem states that for gamma ~20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So when gamma is 20, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is 1/3. But we want the probability to be 2/3. So we need to find the gamma where this probability is higher.

Wait, no, actually, higher gamma would result in a longer mean lifetime. So if gamma increases, the mean path length increases, meaning more particles reach the wall. So when gamma is higher, more particles reach the wall.

In the original case, gamma is 20, and only one third reach the wall. Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. If gamma is higher, the particles live longer, so more should reach the wall. So if gamma was 20 and only a third reach, perhaps the mean path length is such that on average, only a third make it, implying that the mean lifetime is such that the decay length is about equal to the detector radius. Because if the average decay length is equal to the radius, then about 1/e (~37%) of the particles would make it. Hmm, actually, the fraction that survive (don't decay before reaching the wall) is exp(-L/(c tau gamma)), where L is the distance (30m), c is speed of light, tau is proper lifetime.

Wait, the survival probability is exp(-L/(c tau gamma)), right? Because the decay follows an exponential distribution. So if the mean decay length is lambda = c tau gamma. Then the probability of surviving beyond L would be exp(-L/(lambda)).

So in the initial case, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So exp(-30/(c
