Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with something called reagent A, resulting in 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (and H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible combinations for A and B.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but let me think. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add NaCN, which is a source of CN- ion, I think it undergoes a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, ketones can react with cyanide ions in an addition reaction to form a cyanohydrin.

So the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. But wait, what reagents are needed to facilitate this? I think that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the reaction proceeds. Because the ketone's carbonyl is first protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and after deprotonation, water leaves, forming the nitrile and an alcohol.

So for that, the reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+ (which is an acid catalyst, like H+ from H2SO4 or HCl). Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+; options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is an acid source but in a different context, maybe for sulfonation or something else.

Wait, but wait. In the cyanohydrin formation, the reaction is typically done in a solution with an acid catalyst. So A is likely H3O+. So options A and B are possible for the first part.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical ways are either acidic or basic hydrolysis. Let me think about the conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, you usually use H2O with an acid catalyst, like HCl or H2SO4, under high temperature and maybe pressure. Alternatively, under basic conditions, like using NaOH and heat.

But in the problem, the second reagent B is used with H2O. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Looking at the product, it
