Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on certain criteria. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out for each option whether the S/N meets or exceeds 10.

First, I should probably understand what ESPRESSO is capable of. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph installed on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Chile. It's used for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method. High spectral resolution usually means it can detect smaller velocity shifts, which requires a good S/N.

I think the key here is the S/N per pixel. For a star to be detectable, each binned pixel should have a S/N of at least 10. The factors that affect S/N are the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, and the efficiency of the instrument.

So each of the options gives me some information about the star. Let's process them one by one.

Option a) Canopus. I know Canopus is a very bright star, one of the brightest in the sky. Canopus is a star with apparent magnitude around -0.7. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I thought Canopus is about magnitude -0.7 or maybe 0? Wait, no, Canopus is actually in the southern sky and is one of the brightest. So I think its apparent magnitude is about -0.7 or so. Because Sirius is about -1, so Canopus is slightly less bright. Let me think, can't remember exactly. But it's very bright.

So for a very bright star, the S/N would be high, right? Because more photons mean higher S/N. So if Canopus is bright, like around magnitude 1 or lower, the S/N should easily be above 10. So a) is probably detectable.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, right? It has an apparent magnitude of about 2.0. So a bit dimmer than Canopus. But wait, I thought Polaris is actually a binary system, and the primary star is a giant. Anyway, apparent magnitude of around 2. So, is that bright enough?

Wait, the S/N depends on how bright the star is. I think that for a star with magnitude around 10, it's about the limit for some ground-based telescopes, but ESPRESSO is a high-performance spectrograph. Wait, but how does the magnitude translate to S/N?

I remember that S/N increases with the square root of the exposure time and the number of photons. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux / noise) * sqrt(exposure time). For a star's flux, the flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), where m is the apparent magnitude. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact relation here.

Wait, another approach: the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity. I should recall what its S/N capabilities are. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N ratios, especially for bright stars. It can reach S/N levels needed for precise radial velocity measurements. For example, for a star with V=10, it can reach S/N=100 per pixel in an hour with a high-resolution mode. But wait, that's for certain modes.

Wait, but the spectrograph's resolution affects how much light is spread out into each pixel. Higher resolution means each spectral feature is spread over more pixels, but each pixel has lower S/N. So when the question says "binned pixel", perhaps they mean after some binning to reduce the spectral resolution, making each pixel
