Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators, both classical and relativistic.

In the classical case, a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. So F = -kx. The motion is periodic, and the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, meaning all the energy is kinetic. The maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m), where A is the amplitude. That formula is one of the options here—option C. But wait, the question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator, so things might be more complicated.

Relativistic effects come into play when the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, I guess we can't use the classical formulas directly. Instead, I should think about relativistic mechanics, where momentum is gamma*m*v, and energy includes relativistic terms.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator. So, the motion is along a single axis, which simplifies things a bit.

In the relativistic case, the energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but actually, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But I'm a bit confused about the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator.

Wait, in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², but something else. Oh right, in relativity, the total energy is gamma*m*c², which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy.

Wait, but the oscillator has potential energy as well as kinetic. So perhaps the total energy is the sum of both. Wait, no, in relativity, the potential energy might not be the same as the classical case. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, the potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kx², but when you're moving at relativistic speeds, does that change? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the system is treated with a relativistic equation of motion.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the conservation of energy. Let's think about that.

At the maximum displacement, the mass comes to rest for an instant, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the speed is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic. So, in the classical case, E_total = (1/2)kA², and at x=0, E = (1/2)mv². So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m).

But in the relativistic case, when the system is at maximum amplitude, the energy is purely potential. But wait, how is the potential energy defined relativistically? In the classical case, it's (1/2)kA², but maybe in relativity, the potential energy is the same, but the kinetic energy is different.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is the same as in the classical case? No, that might not be right because relativistic effects change the kinetic energy.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the energy. The total energy E of the oscillator in the relativistic case would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, but at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA² + m c²? No, wait. Wait, in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which includes both kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the potential energy might be a separate thing. Or perhaps the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kA², just like classical, but the kinetic energy is gamma*m*v² - m c²? No, wait, relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, putting it together: At maximum displacement x = A, velocity v = 0, so all energy is potential. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A².

Wait, but in the classical case, E = (1/2)k A². But in relativity, do we have the same? Or does the potential energy change?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the approach is to set up the equation of motion. For a harmonic oscillator in relativity, the equation might be different. The force is F = -k x, but F = d(momentum)/dt. Momentum p is gamma m v. So F = d/dt (gamma m v) = m gamma v' + m v (gamma') v', where gamma' is derivative of gamma with respect to v.

Wait, that sounds complicated. Let me try writing it down.

Force F = -k x. So,

d(p)/dt = -k x.

p = gamma m v.

So,

d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x.

But x is the position, and v is dx/dt. So this is a differential equation.

Alternatively, perhaps using energy is easier. At maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so all energy is potential: E = (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic: E = (gamma - 1) m c² (since kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c²).

Wait, that might be the key. So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But we're looking for v, the maximum speed. So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

(1/2)k A² = [ (1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) - 1 ] m c².

Let me rearrange this equation.

Multiply both sides by 2:

k A² = [ 2 (gamma - 1) ] m c².

Wait, but maybe it's better to write:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

Let me solve for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

Hmm, because:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let u = v^2/c^2.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - u) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - u) = 1 + alpha.

Then,

sqrt(1 - u) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Squaring both sides,

1 - u = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

u = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which we can write as:

u = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

u = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, unless alpha is small, but if the amplitude A is such that (k A²)/(2 m c²) is not negligible, then we can't ignore alpha squared.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of a relativistic oscillator, the equation for the maximum speed is derived from this, and we can solve for v.

But let's substitute alpha back in.

So,

u = v^2/c^2 = [ 2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps we can find an expression for v.

Another approach: Let me square both sides of the earlier equation.

Wait, the equation after substitution was:

1/sqrt(1 - u) = 1 + alpha.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - u) = (1 + alpha)^2.

Then,

1 - u = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

u = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is the same as:

u = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

u = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor alpha in numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, but perhaps another approach. Let me write u as v^2/c^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

= c^2 * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so let's substitute that:

v^2 = c² * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2.

Let me simplify this expression.

First, let's compute the terms.

Let me denote beta = k A²/(2 m c²). So, alpha = beta.

Then, v^2 becomes:

c² * [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v^2 = (c² beta (2 + beta)) / (1 + beta)^2.

Let me factor beta:

beta (2 + beta) = beta (beta + 2) = beta² + 2 beta.

So,

v^2 = c² (beta² + 2 beta) / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this differently. Let me write the denominator as (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta².

So,

v^2 = c² [ beta² + 2 beta ] / (beta² + 2 beta + 1 )

Wait, maybe factor numerator:

Numerator: beta (beta + 2) = beta² + 2 beta.

Denominator: (beta +1 )^2.

So,

v^2 = c² [ beta (beta + 2 ) ] / (beta + 1 )^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's better to express this as:

v^2 = c² [ beta (beta + 2) ) ] / ( beta^2 + 2 beta +1 )

But perhaps we can write this as:

v^2 = c² [ beta (beta +2) ] / ( (beta +1)^2 )

= c² [ (beta^2 + 2 beta) ] / ( (beta +1)^2 )

But (beta^2 + 2 beta) = beta (beta + 2 ), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the numerator as (beta +1)^2 + (beta -1).

Wait, let me compute (beta +1)^2 = beta² + 2 beta +1.

But the numerator is beta² + 2 beta = (beta +1)^2 -1.

So,

v^2 = c² [ ( (beta +1)^2 - 1 ) ] / (beta +1)^2.

= c² [ 1 - 1/(beta +1)^2 ].

Wait, that's interesting.

So,

v^2 = c² [1 - 1/(beta +1)^2 ].

Taking square root,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(beta +1)^2 ).

Hmm, let me check that step again.

Wait,

v^2 = c² [ (beta^2 + 2 beta) ] / (beta +1)^2.

= c² [ (beta^2 + 2 beta +1 - 1 ) ] / (beta +1)^2.

= c² [ ( (beta+1)^2 - 1 ) ] / (beta+1)^2.

= c² [ 1 - 1/(beta+1)^2 ].

Yes, that's correct.

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(beta +1)^2 ] ).

But beta is (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 )

So,

beta +1 = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Thus,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

= c sqrt( 1 - ( 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see.

Option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches this expression.

Wait, option D is:

D) v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I've derived.

Alternatively, let me check option B.

Option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²)) )

No, that doesn't match.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))² ) ?

Hmm, no, because denominator is (1 - kA²/(2 m c²)).

So from the earlier steps, the correct expression is option D.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all the energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is expressed as \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at maximum displacement and maximum velocity:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \beta.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \beta)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options do not align with the derived relativistic energy considerations.

**Answer: D**
