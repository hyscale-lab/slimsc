Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I have to calculate and choose between them.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, the initial solution: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, it's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right?

Wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So the new concentration would be 0.025 M. Let me check: M1V1 = M2V2. 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = M2 * 40 cm³. M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid before titration. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). The initial volume was 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. 

Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Before dilution, so moles would be 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ water, the volume becomes 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M as I had before.

So for the titration, each mole of acetic acid will react with one mole of NaOH. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted. So how much NaOH is needed?

Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles
