Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a charge is moving, it creates both electric and magnetic fields. And these fields can be described using scalar potential and vector potential. Right, the scalar potential V and vector potential A.

The question is asking about the expressions for V and A at a point r and time t, considering that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). The time tr is when the field was generated, and since t > tr, we're looking at the fields at a later time.

Wait, the setup mentions that d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So, the distance between the charge's position at tr and the field's observation point r is d. Oh, and the velocity v is at the time tr. So, the charge's velocity when it generated the field is v.

I think I should recall the expressions for the potentials in the case of a moving charge. Let me think. The scalar potential V is usually due to the charge itself, and the vector potential A is due to the motion of the charge, right?

For a stationary charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, there's a correction term because of the motion. Wait, no, in the static case, V is just that, but when considering retarded time or the like, perhaps the expressions change.

Wait, but in the context of retarded potentials, we have to consider the time it takes for the field to propagate. So, the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, specifically tr, which is the retarded time.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that the velocity v is at the field-generating instant tr. So, perhaps I can model this using the retarded time approach.

The scalar potential V is given by the same formula as a static charge but evaluated at the retarded position. Wait, no, the scalar potential is just due to the charge itself, but the vector potential involves the velocity. So, perhaps the scalar potential is (q)/(4πε₀) times 1 over the distance at the retarded time. But the distance here is d, since d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So, |d| would be the distance.

Wait, but in the options, I'm seeing terms like (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Oh, right, because when you have a moving charge, you have to account for the time it takes for the field to propagate. So, the denominator might involve terms that factor in the relative motion.

Let me think about the general form. The scalar potential V is typically (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r')] where r' is the distance from the charge's position at time t - (r/c), because the field takes time to reach the point. So, r' would be sqrt( (d)^2 ), but perhaps in terms of the vector d and the velocity.

Wait, but wait. The retarded time concept: the potential at time t is determined by the charge's position and velocity at time tr, where tr is t - r/(c), with r being the distance between the charge and the observation point at time tr. But in this problem, the observation point is r, and the vector from the charge's position at tr to r is d. So, the distance is |d|, and the time delay is |d|/c, so tr = t - |d|/c.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, I recall that when a charge is moving with velocity v, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some function of the vector d and the velocity.

Wait, let me think about the exact expressions. The scalar potential for a moving charge is V = q/(4πε₀) * [1/(d - (v t')/c²)] where t' is the time variable, but perhaps that's more from the Liénard equations.

Alternatively, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity. For a point charge, the scalar potential V and vector potential A can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q / (4πε₀)) * [1/(d - (v t))],
A(r, t) = (μ₀ q / (4π)) [ (v) / (d - (v t)) ] 

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused between the terms. Let me think step by step.

In the case of a point charge moving with velocity v, the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(r - (v t)/c^2)] 

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the position at the retarded time. So, let me denote the position of the charge at time tr as r', and the observation point at time t is r. The vector from r' to r is d, so d = r - r'. The time tr is such that tr = t - (r - r')/c, but perhaps I should think in terms of the expression for the potentials.

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1 / (|d| - (d · v)/c)] because the denominator involves the distance minus the projection of the velocity multiplied by time. Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's 1/(d - v*(t - tr)), but I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, let me think about how the potentials are derived, perhaps using the Lienard equations. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1 / (r - (r·v)/c)], but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are given by integrals over the charge's history. But maybe I should look for the expressions that match the given options.

Looking at the options:

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + d·v)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c + d·v)).

Wait, so the denominators in options C and D are (dc - d·v) and (dc + d·v) respectively. Let me see.

Wait, the denominator in V's expression for a moving charge would involve (d c - v t), but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the denominator would be (d c - (d · v)), because d·v is the projection of v along d, so that's (v cosθ) times |d|, where θ is the angle between d and v.

Wait, but in the denominator, for the scalar potential, I think it would be (d c - (v · d)), but I need to get the correct expression.

Alternatively, let me think about the expression for the scalar potential. The potential at a point due to a charge moving with velocity v is given by:

V = (q)/(4πε₀) * [1/(d - (v t) ) ]

Wait, but t here is the time variable, but perhaps I should express this in terms of the retarded time.

Wait, no, the correct expression for V is (q)/(4πε₀) * [1/(d - (v (t - tr)) ) ] but perhaps that's not the right way to approach it.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential V for a charge moving with velocity v is given by (q)/(4πε₀ ε) where ε is a term involving the relative motion. Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the standard expressions for potentials due to a moving charge.

In the Coulomb gauge, the potentials are often expressed using the charge density and current density. The scalar potential comes from the charge density, and the vector potential from the current.

But perhaps that's more than I need. Alternatively, the potentials can be written as:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ρ(r', t') / |r - r'| ] d^3 r' dt'

But since the charge is a point charge moving along a trajectory, ρ is a delta function in space and time. Similarly for the current.

Alternatively, using the retarded time approach, the fields are determined by the charge's position and velocity at time tr = t - |r - r'(tr)| / c, where r'(tr) is the position of the charge at tr.

Wait, but in the problem, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr (so r'(tr)) to the observation point r. So d = r - r'(tr). The distance is |d| = r - r'(tr).

So, the scalar potential V at time t would be due to the charge at r'(tr) at time tr, so:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀ |d|) * [1 / (1 - (v · d)/(c |d|)) ) ]

Wait, because the charge is moving, you have to account for the time it takes for the field to reach the observation point. So, the denominator includes a term (1 - (v · d)/(c |d|)) ), which can be rewritten as (|d| c - v · d)/ (|d| c). So, the denominator becomes (|d| c - v · d) / (c |d|). Wait, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, I think the correct expression for V is q/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)/c ). Because when a charge is moving, the denominator would be (distance * c - v·d), right?

Wait, let's compute it:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀ |d|) ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v · (d/|d|)) / c ) ]

Because the denominator is 1/(1 - β·d̂ ), where β is v/c and d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

So, 1/(1- β·d̂ ) is approximately 1 + β·d̂ + (β·d̂)^2 + ... for small β, but perhaps for the general case, it's [c |d| ] / (c |d| - (v · d) )

Wait, because (v · d) = v |d| cosθ, where θ is the angle between v and d.

So,

V = (q)/(4πε₀ |d| ) * [ c |d| / (c |d| - v·d) ) ]

Because 1/(1 - β·d̂) = [c/(c - v·d̂ ) ] when β is in terms of v and d.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. The scalar potential's denominator is (d c - v · d) divided by c. Wait, that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d) multiplied by 1/c. Because the denominator in the expression I saw before is (c |d| - v·d ), and |d| is the distance. So, the denominator is (d c - v·d ), where d is a vector? No, because d c would be a vector, which doesn't make sense in the denominator. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - v·d), which is a scalar.

Wait, if d is a vector, then |d| is the magnitude. So, the denominator is (c |d| - (v · d)).

So, |d| = sqrt(d · d). But perhaps when we write the denominator, it's (c |d| - v · d ) divided by c, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option C has the denominator as (d c - d·v) multiplied by 4π ε₀. Since d is a vector, but the denominator in the options is written as (d c - d·v), which would be a scalar because d·v is a scalar and d c is a vector multiplied by the speed of light, which is a scalar.

Wait, that can't be right, because that would make d c a vector and d·v a scalar, so their subtraction would not make sense—units wouldn't match. So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, maybe the denominator involves (d c) · d, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the denominator is written as (d c - (v · d)) as a scalar. So perhaps it's (c |d| - v · d), because d c is |d| c, and v · d is (v)(|d| cosθ), so the denominator is a scalar.

But looking at the options, in option C, the denominator of V is (d c - d·v). So, if d is a vector and c is a scalar, d c is a vector, and d·v is a scalar. So their subtraction would be vector minus scalar, which isn't possible. That suggests that perhaps the options have a typo, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in the options is actually (c |d| - (v · d)), which is a scalar. So in the options, perhaps (d c) is intended to mean |d| c, the magnitude times c.

So, if I take that interpretation, the denominator in option C would be (c |d| - (v · d)).

So, then V would be (q c)/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - (v · d)) ), which can be written as (q c)/(4π ε₀ |d| ( c - (v · d̂ )) ), where d̂ is the unit vector in d's direction.

Hmm, but that's not matching what I remember. Let me think again. The usual expression I've seen for the scalar potential when considering motion is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( |r - r'(tr)| ) ] * (1/(1 - (v · r̂ )/c )) 

where r̂ is the unit vector from r'(tr) to r.

Expressed as:

V = (q)/(4πε₀ |d|) * [ c / (c - (v · d̂ )) ]

Because 1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) = c/(c - (v · d̂ )).

So, that would make V = (q c)/(4πε₀ |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) )

But |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) is |d| c - (v · d̂ ) |d| ) = c |d| - (v · d) because d · v = v · d = v |d| cosθ = (v · d̂ ) |d|.

So, that expression becomes (q c) / (4πε₀ (c |d| - (v · d)) )

Which is the same as (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v ·d )) ), but wait, no: because c |d| is the same as |d| c, not d c. Because d is a vector, but |d| is a scalar multiplied by c.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - v ·d ), so the entire denominator is a scalar.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v))

Option D: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + d·v))

Wait, in option C, the denominator is (d c - d·v), which, if d is a vector, doesn't make sense, but perhaps it's a typo and they meant (c |d| - d·v ). So, with that in mind, option C would have the correct denominator.

Then, the vector potential A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π (c |d| - d·v )) ), which is option C's A.

So, putting it together, option C has V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - d·v )) and A = (μ₀ q v c)/(4π (c |d| - d·v )) )

Wait, but looking at option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v), which as a vector minus scalar doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the denominator in the options is a scalar, and the expression is (c |d| - (v · d)) as the denominator. So, if the options have (d c - d · v ), perhaps it's a misprint, and the intended denominator is (c |d| - (d · v )).

Assuming that, then option C would have V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - (d · v )) ), and A would be (μ₀ q v c)/(4π (c |d| - (d · v )) )

Wait, but looking at option C's A, it's written as (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v )). If the denominator is (c |d| - d · v ), then it would match.

So, considering that, option C would correctly represent both potentials.

Another way to think: the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v )/(4π ) times 1/(c |d| - (d · v )) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The potentials for a moving charge are:

V = (q)/(4πε₀ |d|) * [1/(1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) ]

Which is (q c)/(4πε₀ |d| ( c - (v · d̂ )) )

And since (v · d̂ ) is v cosθ, so (c - (v cosθ )) is the denominator.

So, V becomes (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - (v · d )) )

Which matches the V in option C, if the denominator is (d c - d · v ), but again, the problem is that d c is a vector and d · v is a scalar. So, perhaps in the options, d c is a typo for |d| c.

Assuming that, then option C is correct.

As for the vector potential A, the expression is:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4π (c |d| - (v · d )) )

Which is exactly what option C presents for A: (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d · v )). Wait, but option C has (d c - d · v ), which, if d c is |d| c, then the denominator is correct.

Wait, but in option C, the A is written as (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - d·v )). So, assuming that d c is |d| c, then the denominator is (c |d| - d·v ), which is correct.

Thus, option C would be the correct choice.

So, the answer is option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) at a point \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \), we consider a point charge \( q \) moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The potentials are influenced by the charge's motion and must account for the time delay due to the finite speed of light.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential is derived from the charge \( q \) and depends on the distance \( |\vec{d}| \) and the relative motion between the charge and the observation point.
   - The denominator includes a correction term due to the motion of the charge, which is proportional to \( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \). This arises from the time delay in the propagation of the field.
   - The correct expression for \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) is:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})}.
     \]
   - This matches the form given in **Option C**, where the denominator is interpreted as \( c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \), assuming a possible typographical adjustment in the options.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and depends on the same denominator as the scalar potential, \( c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \).
   - The correct expression for \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) is:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})}.
     \]
   - This matches the form given in **Option C**.

3. **Other Options:**
   - **Option A** and **Option B** do not account for the motion of the charge correctly and are inconsistent with the retarded potential formalism.
   - **Option D** has an incorrect sign in the denominator, which does not align with the standard expressions for retarded potentials.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, assuming the denominator is interpreted as \( c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \). This accounts for the motion of the charge and the time delay in the field propagation.
