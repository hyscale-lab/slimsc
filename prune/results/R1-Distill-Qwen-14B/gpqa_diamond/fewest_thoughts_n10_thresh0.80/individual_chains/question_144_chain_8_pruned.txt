Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance called X. The question is asking for the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mean decay length involves the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?

Let's see, the given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. Oh right, particles decay, and the distance they travel before decaying is called the mean decay length.

First, I think I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. I remember that τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Wait, but Γ is the total decay width, right?

Wait, let me think again. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Because the width Γ is related to the particle's decay rate. Since Γ has units of energy, ħ has units of J·s. So when I divide ħ by Γ, I get time.

But wait, let me check the units. Γ is given in MeV. I know that 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. But to use SI units, I need to convert this into Joules.
