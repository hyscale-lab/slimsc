Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. The given data includes the production energy (E_X = 8 GeV), the mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), and the width (Γ_X = 320 MeV). The options are all different distances in meters, so I think I need to calculate how far the meson travels before decaying.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't stay around forever. It decays after some time. The mean lifetime is related to the particle's width, which is a measure of its instability. The formula I think I need is something like the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by the total decay width Γ. Oh wait, Γ is the decay width, right? So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check. Γ is the width, which is energy, so using it in the denominator makes sense because a larger width (more unstable) would mean a shorter lifetime.

But wait, sometimes I see width written as Γ, sometimes as Γ_total. I think that's the same thing. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the mean lifetime, I can find out how far the meson travels on average before decaying. That would be the product of the velocity v and the lifetime τ. So distance d = v * τ.

But to get v, I probably need the relativistic expression. Since the meson is produced with some energy, and its mass is given, perhaps I should calculate its velocity. Alternatively, maybe use the energy to find the momentum and then the velocity.

Wait, the production energy is 8 GeV. But the mass of the meson is 1.2 GeV, so that's much less than the production energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the production energy is the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps E_X is the total energy, including rest mass. Because in particle physics, when they say energy, it's usually the total energy.

So E = γ m c². So the total energy is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the kinetic energy would be E - m c², but maybe that's not directly necessary.

Wait, but when calculating the velocity, I can use the relativistic energy equation. The energy of a particle is E = γ m c², where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, the momentum p is sqrt( (E c)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

The relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)². So solving for p, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c². Wait, no, let me get the units right. Let me write it as E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c². Wait, no, the units don't make sense. Wait, E is in GeV, m c² is in GeV as well, because m is in GeV/c². Let me correct this.

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / (c^2) ? Wait, no, if E is in GeV, then (p c) would be in GeV, so p = (sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 )) / c. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units, but perhaps it's easier to compute everything in natural units where c=1. So, in natural units, E² = p² + m².

So for natural units, p = sqrt( E² - m² ). But E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV. Let me compute that: 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p is sqrt(62.56) GeV. What's the square root of 62.56? Let's see, 7.9^2 is 62.41, and 7.91^2 is 62.5681. Oh, so p is approximately 7.91 GeV/c. Wait, but wait, because if we're using natural units, and c=1, then p would be in GeV/c. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the velocity beta (β) as β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Because in that case, E is the total energy, which is γ m c². So E = γ m c², and β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, so β = sqrt(1 - (m c²)^2/(E^2)).

Plugging in the numbers: m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So (m c²)^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.

(E)^2 = 64 (GeV)^2.

So 1 - (1.44)/(64) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

That makes sense, as a high-energy particle would be moving very close to the speed of light.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Let me make sure of the units here. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

But ħ is in units of GeV·s. Wait, natural units again. Hmm, sometimes it's easier to compute in terms of GeV and seconds.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then τ = ħ / Γ.

So Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.

Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25
