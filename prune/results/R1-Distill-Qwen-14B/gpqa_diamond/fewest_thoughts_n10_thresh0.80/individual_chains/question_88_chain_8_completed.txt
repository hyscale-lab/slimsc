Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, I need to figure out what process is happening based on the observations. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the experiment: they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. So, these proteins are probably on the inside, maybe involved in the structure or replication. Then, they delivered them to mice via oral gavage. I remember that oral delivery is common for studying gut pathogens because the stomach and intestines are where they'd naturally be.

The results: some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, the stomach has a lot of acid, which can break down proteins. So the GFP, which is attached to these proteins, might denature or get digested there. But some of them made it past the stomach acid and then got entangled in the intestinal mucus. Mucus can trap things, so maybe the proteins stuck there didn't make it to the lymphoid organs.

But then they were able to identify fluorescent Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are these small structures in the intestinal wall that are part of the immune system. They're like little pockets where immune cells can sample antigens from the gut. So the GFP-tagged proteins must have gotten to these patches.

They isolated the proliferating cell population from the Peyer's patches. Proliferating cells are likely immune cells that are dividing, maybe B cells or T cells that have been activated. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene of these cells and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions usually points to some kind of diversification process.

Wait, what processes lead to variability in the heavy chain? There's VDJ recombination, which happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. That's the process where different V, D, and J segments are joined to create the unique variable region of the B cell receptor. But that happens early on, when B cells are developing, not necessarily during a response.

Then there's somatic hypermutation, which occurs during the immune response, especially in lymphoid tissues, to increase the diversity of the B cell receptors. This happens after the initial diversification, allowing for fine-tuning of the antigen-binding sites. This process is crucial for generating high-affinity antibodies.

Class switching recombination is about changing the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) and is regulated by signals from other cells, like cytokines. But this doesn't directly create variability in the variable regions, just changes the type of antibody produced.

Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking pathogens, not directly about generating variability in immune cells' receptors.

So in this case, the GFP-tagged proteins (antigens) reached the Peyer's patches, which are sites where immune cells sample antigens. The cells that are proliferating here are probably B cells that have been activated by the antigen. The high variability in their variable heavy chain genes suggests that they underwent a process that diversifies these regions. Since they're in the lymphoid tissue and during an immune response, this sounds like somatic hypermutation.

VDJ recombination is done when the B cells are in the bone marrow, during their development, so it's probably not the case here. So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reached the Peyer's patches, where they were isolated from proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells revealed high variability, indicating a diversification process.

Key processes that generate variability in the variable heavy chain include:

1. **VDJ Recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are rearranged to create unique variable regions. However, this process happens early in development, not during an immune response.

2. **Somatic Hypermutation**: This process occurs during the immune response, particularly in lymphoid tissues like Peyer's patches. It diversifies the variable regions of B cell receptors to improve antigen binding and generate high-affinity antibodies.

3. **Class Switching Recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not directly increase variability in the variable regions.

4. **Complement Activation**: This involves the complement system attacking pathogens and is unrelated to receptor diversification.

Given that the experiment involved an immune response in the Peyer's patches and high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response to diversify B cell receptors.
