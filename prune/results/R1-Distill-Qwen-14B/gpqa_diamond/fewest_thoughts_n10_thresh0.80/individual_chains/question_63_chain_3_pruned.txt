Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diatomic molecule switching states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 as well, since that's the ground state for rotation). So when it absorbs a photon, it'll transition to the next higher state. But what's the next lowest possible? I think it depends on whether it's a pure vibrational transition or a rotational one. But since the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, maybe it's the first excited vibrational state, v=1, with J staying at 0? Or could it involve a change in both rotation and vibration?

Wait, no, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which for the rotation-vibration model is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be the first excited state, which is when it either increases v or J. But the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, wait, the next state would be the lowest possible energy higher than the current. So the lowest possible next state would be the first excited vibrational state, v=1, with J=0? Because vibrational energy changes contribute more to energy than rotational for diatomic molecules. Or maybe it's a change in J with v=0? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem states it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model. Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor model includes both rotational and vibrational energies. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule are given by the combination of vibrational and rotational states.

In the rigid rotor approximation, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and the vibrational levels are quantized as well. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next lowest state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v
