Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator. But wait, this is the rotation-vibration model, maybe a non-rigid rotor? Or is it the rigid rotor with vibration considered?

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I have to calculate which one is correct.

Let me jot down the given data:
- Mx, mass of X = 20 amu
- My, mass of Y = 2 amu
- R, bond length = 2 angstroms
- w, angular frequency = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, the question is about moving from the fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what does that mean? The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, but I think in the rotation-vibration model, the states are a combination of both.

So the molecule is currently in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0 or J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid rotor). But I'm a bit confused about the selection rules here. In the rigid rotor model, the rotational quantum number J can change by ±1. And for the harmonic oscillator, the vibrational quantum number n changes by ±1.

Wait, but the problem says it's the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for a diatomic is n=0 and J=0 (for vibration and rotation). Or is the fundamental state just the lowest vibrational state, regardless of rotation? Hmm, sometimes the term fundamental refers to the lowest vibrational state, and the rotational states are considered separately.

Wait, in spectroscopy, the absorption of a photon usually causes a transition from the ground state (n=0, J) to an excited state (n=0, J+1), or maybe (n=1, J). But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So maybe it's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. 

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule needs to reach the
