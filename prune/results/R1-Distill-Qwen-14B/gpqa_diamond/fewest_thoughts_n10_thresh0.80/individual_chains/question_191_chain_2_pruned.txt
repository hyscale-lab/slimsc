Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what happens step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (like -CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2?), wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent would be the part from the double bond. So prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2-CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw this.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let's think. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 in propene, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the substituent is attached to the middle carbon. So, structure is CH2=C(CH2 something?)... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-? No, wait, substituent is attached to the second carbon, right? So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between 1 and 2. So, when it's attached to the cyclohexane, the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's isopropenyl group. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl. So, that group is CH2-C(CH2? No, wait. Isopropenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait. The structure is CH2=C(CH3)-. So, the substituent is CH2 attached to the cyclohexane, then the double
