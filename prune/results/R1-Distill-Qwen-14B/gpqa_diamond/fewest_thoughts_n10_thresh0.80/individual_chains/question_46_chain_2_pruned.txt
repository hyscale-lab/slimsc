Okay, so I have this problem about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the catalyst breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is especially good for ring-closing metathesis and for breaking more substituted alkenes, maybe.

The compound here is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count. Pent has five carbons. 1-ene is double bond between 1 and 2. 3-methyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons? Let's check: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, but racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. But in this case, does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a chiral center? Let me see: the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The double bond is at the beginning, so the third carbon (CH(CH3)) is connected to four different groups? Let me see: what's attached to the third carbon? It's connected to CH2=CH-, a methyl group (CH3), and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let me look again. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the third carbon is attached to a CH2CH2 group? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me number: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). So the third carbon has groups: CH2CH2? No, wait.
