Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So, there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as mu = gamma * S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After that, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is asking about the oscillation frequency of this average.

Hmm, I remember that when you change the direction of the magnetic field, the particle's spin will precess around the new field direction. But I need to think about how this affects the expectation value of S_z, the z-component of the spin.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. Oh wait, wait—is that correct? Or is it mu = gamma times the spin in the direction of the magnetic field. Because in a magnetic field, the energy is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the field. So, the Hamiltonian would be something like H = -mu · B.

Right, for a magnetic field B in the +Z direction, the Hamiltonian would be H_initial = -gamma S_z * B. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the spin-up and spin-down states along Z. So, the initial state of the particle is an eigenstate of S_z. But when the field is switched to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes.

When the field is along +Y, the new Hamiltonian H_final would be proportional to S_y. So, H_final = -gamma B S_y. Wait, but wait—since mu is gamma S_z, but now the magnetic field is in Y, so the interaction is with S_y. So H = - mu · B, which would be - (gamma S_z) · B. Wait, no, the magnetic dipole moment is proportional to the spin, but in the direction of the spin, and the magnetic field is along Y. So actually, the magnetic moment is a vector, mu = gamma S, where S is the spin operator vector (S_x, S_y, S_z). So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B =
