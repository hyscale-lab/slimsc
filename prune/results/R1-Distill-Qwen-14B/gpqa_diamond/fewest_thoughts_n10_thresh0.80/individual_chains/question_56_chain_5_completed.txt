Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct transition route and the probability.

Wait, I remember that in hydrogen, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules. Dipole transitions, right. The selection rules for dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, but for the s state, l=0, so the transitions from l=0 would have to go to l=1, right?

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is an s orbital. It decays to |1,0,0⟩, another s orbital. Wait, but in dipole transitions, you can't go from l=0 to l=0 because Δl must be ±1. Oh wait, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions. So it must go through an intermediate state, maybe l=1 in the first step, then another l=0.

Hmm, let's think. So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. To go to n=1, l=0, m=0, it must make two steps. Each step is a dipole transition, so each must follow the selection rules.

First transition: from |3,0,0⟩. So possible transitions are to states where l is 1, since Δl=±1. So from l=0 to l=1. Also, m can change by 0, ±1. So m=0 can go to m= -1, 0, or +1. So for the first step, the possible states are |2,1, m⟩ where m is -1, 0, +1. Because the next step would be from there to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0, so again Δl = -1. And for each of these, m can change by 0, ±1.

But wait, the initial step is from |3,0,0⟩. So the possible first steps are to |2,1, m⟩, m = -1,0, +1. Then, each of those can transition to |1,0, m'⟩ where m' is m ±1 or same.

Wait, but the target is |1,0,0⟩. So, let's see. Let's take each possible first transition and see if the second transition can reach |1,0,0⟩.

First case: First transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩. Then, from |2,1,1⟩, the next dipole transition can go to |1,0, m'⟩. Since Δl must be -1, that's correct. Now, from m=1, what are the possible m' in the next step? They can be m' =0, 1, or 2? Wait, no. Wait, for dipole transitions, the change in m is 0, ±1. So from m=1, the next m can be 0,1, or 2? No, wait, the m can change by 0, ±1, but the next state is in l=0, which can only have m=0. So from |2,1,1⟩, the possible m in the next state would have to be m' = 1 -1 =0, or 1, but wait l=0 can't have m=1 or 2. So the only possible is m' =0. So the transition from |2,1,1⟩ would have to go to |1,0,0⟩. So that's possible.

Wait, but wait, does that mean that |2,1,1⟩ can transition to |1,0,0⟩? Because m changes from 1 to 0. That's Δm = -1, which is allowed. So yes, that's a possible path.

Similarly, let's look at the other possible first steps. Let's say the first transition is to |2,1,0⟩. Then, from |2,1,0⟩, the next transition must go to |1,0, m'⟩. Since m can change by ±1 or 0, so m' can be -1, 0, or +1. But since the next state is l=0, m' must be 0. So from |2,1,0⟩, can we go to |1,0,0⟩? Yes, because m can stay the same. So that's another possible path.

Similarly, the first transition could be to |2,1,-1⟩. Then, from here, the next transition could go to |1,0,0⟩, since m changes from -1 to 0, which is a Δm of +1. So that's allowed.

So all three first transitions (m= -1, 0, +1) are possible, and each can lead to |1,0,0⟩ in the second step.

But wait, the question says the transition route and the corresponding probability. Also, the options only show certain routes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0 with probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0 with 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0 with 1/4.

Option D: 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0 with 2/3.

Wait, but the problem is that the question says the state decays via two dipole transitions. So the possible routes are three different possible intermediates (m= -1, 0, +1), each leading to the final state. So the probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path.

But wait, the options here are giving each possible route along with a probability, but the question says 'the corresponding probability' of the route. Or is it the total probability? Hmm, I think each option is presenting a possible route and its probability. So maybe the correct route is one of these, and the probability is the product of the transition probabilities for each step.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition has certain allowed or forbidden probabilities based on the selection rules and other factors, like the matrix elements.

Wait, but each transition's probability depends on the square of the dipole matrix element. The dipole transition moment is proportional to ⟨f| r |i⟩, where r is the position operator.

In hydrogen, the matrix elements for dipole transitions are non-zero only when the angular part involves Y_{l',m'} being connected by the spherical harmonics of Y_{1,m} (since r is proportional to Y_{1,0} perhaps? Or wait, no, wait, the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, m}, with m=-1,0,+1, corresponding to the x, y, z directions.

Wait, the dipole operator components are proportional to Y_{1, m} where m = -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ is allowed if m' = m + q, where q is -1, 0, +1. So for each dipole transition, the change in m is either -1, 0, or +1.

So for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩, which has m=0, the possible m' in the next state would be 0-1=-1, 0, +1. So the first transition can go to m' = -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second transition must take m'' from that to m=0, because the final state is |1,0,0⟩, m=0.

So, taking each possible first step:

Case 1: First transition to |2,1,1⟩ (m=1). Then the second transition must go to m=0. So m changes by -1. How likely is that? The probability is the square of the matrix element for that transition.

Case 2: First transition to |2,1,0⟩. Then the second transition must stay at m=0. So m doesn't change.

Case 3: First transition to |2,1,-1⟩. Then the second transition must go to m=0, which is a change of +1.

Now, the probability for each path is the product of the probabilities of each transition.

But how do we calculate those probabilities? The matrix elements for dipole transitions depend on the overlap integrals, which involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the transition probability is proportional to |⟨f | e r | i⟩|². For hydrogen, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the integral involving the initial and final states' wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator component.

In terms of angular parts, the integral over angles is ⟨Y_{l',m'} | Y_{1, q} Y_{l, m} ⟩, where q is the component (-1, 0, +1) of the dipole operator.

This integral is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. For example, when adding angular momenta, the integral is non-zero if l' = l ±1, and m' = m + q.

So, for the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ (l=0, m=0) to |2,1, m'⟩, the dipole operator component must contribute q such that m' = m + q. So m' can be 0 + q, so q can be -1, 0, +1, leading to m' = -1, 0, +1.

The angular integral for each transition is:

⟨ Y_{1, m'} | Y_{1, q} Y_{0, 0} ⟩

Wait, no. Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, q}, so the matrix element for the dipole transition involves integrating Y_{l',m'}* Y_{1, q} Y_{l, m}.

But since the initial state is l=0, m=0. So the integral is Y_{l', m'}* (Y_{1, q}) Y_{0,0}.

Wait, Y_{0,0} is a constant, so this becomes the integral of Y_{l',m'}^* Y_{1,q}.

Using the properties of spherical harmonics, this integral is non-zero only if l' = 1 (since 0 +1 =1), and m' = q.

Wait, because Y_{1,q} is part of the dipole operator. So the integral for each transition would be non-zero only if the conditions are met.

Wait, for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m'⟩, the dipole operator must have a component q such that m' = m + q. Since m is 0, m' = q. So q can be -1, 0, +1, leading to m' = -1, 0, +1.

The angular integral for each is:

⟨ Y_{1, m'} | Y_{1, q} ⟩ * something, but wait, actually when you have the product Y_{1 q} Y_{0 0}, which is just Y_{1 q} because Y_{0,0}=1/(sqrt(4pi)). So the integral becomes:

∫ Y_{l', m'}^* Y_{1 q} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But since Y_{0,0} is 1/(sqrt(4pi)), this reduces to:

1/(sqrt(4pi)) ∫ Y_{l', m'}^* Y_{1 q} dΩ.

But for this integral to be non-zero, it must satisfy the selection rule for addition of angular momenta. Specifically, the product Y_{1 q} can contribute to Y_{l', m'}, so we have l' = 1, m' = q.

Wait, that's because the integral is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l' m' | 1 q ⟩ 0 0, but since the initial state is l=0, the only possible l' is 1. So for each m', the integral is non-zero only if m' = q.

So for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m'⟩, the possible m' are -1, 0, +1, each corresponding to q = -1, 0, +1.

So each of these transitions is allowed, and the matrix element for each will have a certain value.

So the first transition's probability is proportional to |⟨ Y_{1, m'} | Y_{1, q} ⟩|^2, but wait, q is m' in this case, so it's |⟨Y_{1, m'} | Y_{1, m'}⟩|², which is 1. Hmm, but that's not considering the radial parts.

Wait, no, because the radial parts also contribute to the matrix element. The dipole matrix element is proportional to the integral of the radial wavefunctions multiplied by the angular part. So perhaps the radial parts are the same for each of the m' states, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the radial integral for each transition (3s→2p) would be the same for all m' states because m doesn't affect the radial part. So the radial factor is the same for all three possible m' states. Therefore, the probability for each of the three transitions (m'=-1, 0, +1) would have the same radial part.

The angular part, as we saw, would be proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or overlap, which in this case is non-zero and the same for each m' because the initial state has m=0.

Wait, but the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding l=0 and l=1 would be ⟨1 m' | 1 q; 0 0⟩. Since the initial state is m=0, and the dipole operator contributes q=m'.

So the angular integral is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨1 m' | 1 m'⟩, which is 1 for each m'.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps each of the three possible m' states (m'=-1, 0, +1) has the same transition probability for the first step because the radial part is the same, and the angular part is the same for each m' due to symmetry.

If that's the case, then each of the three possible first steps has equal probability. So each has a probability of 1/3.

Then, for the second transition, each of these states (m'=-1, 0, +1) would transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

Now, the second transition is from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Again, using the selection rules, this is a dipole transition. So l changes by Δl = -1 (from 1 to 0), and m changes by Δm = 0, ±1. So for each m', the possible m'' in the final state would be m' ±1 or m'.

But the final state has m''=0. So for each m' in the intermediate state, what m'' can we reach?

Case 1: m' = 1.

We need to reach m'' = 0. So Δm = -1. So the dipole operator must have q = -1.

The probability of this transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which would have an angular part involving Y_{0,0} and Y_{1, -1}, and the initial Y_{1,1}.

The angular integral for this second transition would be:

∫ Y_{0,0}^* Y_{1, q} Y_{1,1} dΩ.

Which is non-zero when q = -1, because to get from l=1, m=1 to l=0, m=0, the q must be -1 (since m'=1 + q =0 → q=-1).

So the angular part for this transition is non-zero.

Similarly, the radial integral for this transition is from n=2 to n=1. The dipole matrix element for 2p→1s.

But I'm not sure about the exact values, but assuming that radial parts are the same for each m, perhaps the probability for each transition (from each m') depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the angular part.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0 0 | 1 -1; 1 1⟩. Wait, no, the CG coefficient for combining two angular momenta.

Wait, the integral for the angular part when going from |1, m'| to |0,0⟩ via a dipole transition (q) would involve integrating Y_{0,0}^* * Y_{1, q} * Y_{1, m'}.

This is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨0 0 | 1 q; 1 m'⟩.

Which is non-zero only if m' + q = 0. So q = -m'.

In our case, for the second transition, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each m':

- m'=1: q must be -1 → m' + q =0.
- m'=0: q must be 0 → m'=0 + 0=0.
- m'=-1: q must be +1 → m' + q=0.

So for each m', the only allowed q is -m'.

So each second transition's angular part is proportional to CG coefficient for the specific m' and q.

The CG coefficients for ⟨0 0 | 1 q; 1 m'⟩ where q = -m'.

So let's compute these CG coefficients.

For each case:

Case 1: m' =1, q = -1.

The CG coefficient is ⟨0 0 | 1 (-1); 1 1⟩.

The CG coefficient for combining l=1, m=-1 and l=1, m=1 to get l=0, m=0.

Wait, no, wait: the CG coefficient is given by:

⟨ l' m' | l1 m1; l2 m2 ⟩

In our case, l1=1 (from the dipole operator), m1 = q.

l2=1 (from the initial state), m2 = m'.

We want l' =0, m' =0.

So the CG coefficient is ⟨0 0 | 1 q; 1 m'⟩.

We can look up some CG coefficients.

The CG coefficient for ⟨0 0 | 1 1; 1 -1⟩ is zero because m1 + m2 = 1 + (-1) =0, which matches m'=0. Wait, but l would have to add to 0.

Wait, no, the sum of angular momenta l1 and l2 (each 1) must be >= l' =0. So l1 + l2 =2, and l' can be 0,1,2. So it's possible.

But in our case, the CG coefficient for ⟨0 0 | 1 q; 1 m'⟩ where q =-m' (since m' + q=0).

So for each scenario:

- m' =1, q=-1.

CG coefficient is ⟨0 0 | 1 (-1); 1 1⟩.

Which is zero because the total m is 1 + (-1) =0, which is the same as m' =0, but the total l would have to be 0. But the CG coefficient for ⟨0 0|1 m; 1 m'⟩ when m +m' =0.

Wait, perhaps the correct CG coefficient is zero unless certain conditions are met. Let me think.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact values. Alternatively, perhaps the square of the CG coefficients for each case determines the probability.

The CG coefficients for ⟨0 0 | 1 m; 1 m'⟩ where m + m' =0.

For m=1, m'=-1: the CG is zero because the only way to combine two l=1 states to get l=0 is if the m's cancel. But for l=1, m=1 and l=1, m=-1, their sum can give l=0, but wait, no, because the sum of two l=1 states can give l=0,1,2. So specifically, the CG coefficient ⟨0 0|1 1; 1 -1⟩ is sqrt(1/6). Because when you combine l=1 and l=1, the l=0 state has m=0, and the CG coefficient is sqrt( ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) / (4π) * ( (j - m)! (j + m)! ) / ... )) but I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the CG coefficient for combining two l=1 states to get l=0 is zero for m=0, but wait, let's think of the possible combinations.

Wait, for two l=1 states, combining to l=0: the possible m's must add to zero. So m1 + m2 =0.

So for m1=1 and m2= -1:

The CG coefficient is ⟨0 0 | 1 1; 1 -1⟩.

Wait, actually, the CG coefficient for combining l1=1, m1=1 and l2=1, m2=-1 to get l'=0, m'=0 is sqrt( ( (2*1 +1) ) / ( (2*0 +1) (2*1 +1) )) ) * something... Maybe it's sqrt( (2) / ( (1)(3) )) ) = sqrt(2/3).

Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps another approach is better.

The number of ways to combine l=1 and l=1 to get l=0 is 2*(2l1 +1) = 2*3=6? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the square of each CG coefficient for each possible transition is the same, leading to equal probabilities.

Wait, but according to selection rules and symmetry, perhaps the transition probabilities from each intermediate state (m'=-1,0,+1) to the final state are different.

Wait, when the intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩, the second transition's Δm is 0. So the dipole operator component would have q=0. So the matrix element for this transition would involve Y_{1,0}, which is proportional to cosθ.

But for the other cases, when m' is 1 or -1, the q needed is -1 or +1, respectively.

So, the probability for each second transition may not be the same.

In particular, the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ would have a higher probability because Y_{1,0} is symmetric and can have a larger overlap with Y_{0,0}.

But I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the transition through m'=0 has a higher probability than the others.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The CG coefficients for each case:

Case 1: m'=1, q=-1 → CG is √( ( (1)(1) ) / ( (1)(3) ) ) ) × something.

Wait, another approach: when l1=1, l2=1, l'=0.

The CG coefficients for m1 + m2 =0 are:

For m1=1, m2=-1 → CG coefficient is sqrt( ( (1 +1 +0 +1)! ) / ... ) Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I recall that the CG coefficients for combining two p orbitals (l=1) to get an s orbital (l=0, m=0) are zero except when the m's sum to zero. And the coefficient is sqrt( ( (2l1 +1) ) / (4π) ) ) × something.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for ⟨0 0 | 1 m1; 1 m2⟩ is zero unless m1 + m2 =0.

In this case, for the second transition, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each m', the CG coefficient is:

- m'=1 → q=-1. So CG is ⟨0 0 | 1 (-1); 1 1⟩.

Which is zero because combining m=-1 (from dipole) and m=1 (from state) gives m_total=0, but for l=0, it's possible. Wait, but the CG coefficient for this combination is non-zero.

Wait, I think the correct CG coefficients for combining two l=1 states into an l=0 state are as follows:

For m=0:

The possible combinations are m1 + m2 =0.

So the CG coefficients for l=1, m1 and l=1, m2 where m1 + m2 =0.

The CG coefficients are zero for |m1 - m2| > l', but since l'=0, m1 + m2 =0, so...

The CG coefficients for combining l=1 and l=1 to get l'=0 and m=0:

⟨0 0 | 1 m1; 1 m2⟩ is zero unless m1 + m2 =0.

So for m1=1, m2=-1:

The CG coefficient is sqrt( ( ( (2*1 +1) ) / ( (2*0 +1)(2*1 +1) ) ) ) ) × something else. Wait, I think the actual value is sqrt( ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) / (4π) ) ) × ... but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the three possible second transitions has the same probability. If that's the case, then the total probability would be the sum of the three possible paths.

But since each path is equally likely, each has a probability of 1/3, so the total is 3*(1/3 * 1/3) ? No, wait, no, because each path is a two-step process.

Alternatively, each path (m'=-1, 0, +1) contributes a certain probability. If each first transition has a probability of 1/3, and each second transition has a probability of 1/3 as well, then each path would have a probability of (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9, and the total would be 3*(1/9)=1/3.

But that's the total probability, not the probability of a particular path.

The question, however, asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options present specific routes with their own probabilities.

Looking at the options, option A presents a specific route (3,0,0 →2,1,0→1,0,0) with probability 1/3. Option B and C have 1/4 each. So the question is, which route has the highest probability.

But why would the route via m'=0 have higher probability than others?

Because the transition via m'=0 has a higher probability in the second step, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the dipole transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is allowed, and then from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is also allowed.

The probability for each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element. The matrix element for a dipole transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the angular part multiplied by the radial part.

The radial part for the transition 3s→2p is the same for all m', but the angular part depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

For the first transition, each m' (-1, 0, +1) has the same |matrix element|^2 because the initial state is spherically symmetric (m=0), so each m' is equally likely.

So the first transition probabilities are each 1/3.

For the second transition, when m' is 0, the transition to m=0 is allowed with q=0. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this is ⟨0 0 | 1 0; 1 0⟩, which is 1.

In contrast, when m' is 1, the transition requires q=-1, and the CG coefficient is sqrt( (1 * 1) / ( (1)(3) ) ) ) ? Or maybe it's sqrt( ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) )/(4π (2l' +1)) )) ) × something.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for ⟨0 0 | 1 0; 1 0⟩ is 1, and for the other cases, it's sqrt(1/3).

Wait, when combining two l=1 states to get l'=0, the CG coefficients for m1 and m2 being 0 and 0 would be 1, because that's the only way to get m=0. But wait, no, because combining l=1 and l=1 can also give l=0 with other m combinations.

Wait, perhaps the correct value is that the CG coefficient for ⟨0 0 |1 0;1 0⟩ is 1. Because if you have two states with m=0, their combination can give m=0, and l=0.

So the square of this coefficient is 1. But for the other cases, like m'=1 and q=-1, the CG coefficient is sqrt( ( (1)(1) ) / ( (1)(3) ) ) ) = sqrt(1/3).

Wait, if that's the case, then the second transition's probability for m'=0 is 1, and for m'=1 and m'=-1, it's 1/3.

So the probabilities for each second transition:

- From m'=0: probability 1.

- From m'=1: probability (1/3).

- From m'=-1: probability (1/3).

So the total probability for each possible path is:

Path 1: m'=-1 → probability of first step (1/3) * second step (1/3) = (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9.

Path 2: m'=0 → (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.

Path 3: m'=1 → (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

So the total probability for each path is as above.

Therefore, the path via |2,1,0⟩ has a higher probability of 1/3, while the others are smaller.

Wait, but the question asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability. So the correct route is via |2,1,0⟩, which has a probability of 1/3.

Looking at the options, option A says the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. That matches.

Option D says the same route but with probability 2/3, which is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for dipole transitions dictate that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Since the initial state |3,0,0⟩ has l = 0 and m = 0, the first transition must go to a state with l = 1 and m = -1, 0, or +1. These possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,+1⟩. The second transition must then bring the system to the final state |1,0,0⟩, which has l = 0 and m = 0.

### Analysis of the Transition Routes:
1. **First Transition**:  
   From |3,0,0⟩, the possible transitions are to |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,+1⟩. These transitions are equally likely because the radial part of the matrix element is the same for all three, and the angular part is symmetric. Thus, each first transition has a probability of 1/3.

2. **Second Transition**:  
   From the intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,+1⟩, the system transitions to |1,0,0⟩. The probability of each second transition depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which determine the overlap between the angular parts of the initial and final states.  
   - For |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the transition is allowed with Δm = 0, and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 1, giving the maximum probability.  
   - For |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the transitions are allowed with Δm = -1 and Δm = +1, respectively. These transitions have lower probabilities due to smaller Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

3. **Total Probability for Each Path**:  
   - Path 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.  
   - Path 2: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Probability = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.  
   - Path 3: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: Probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.  

Thus, the path via |2,1,0⟩ has the highest probability of 1/3.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the analysis.  
- **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the probability for this path is 1/9, not 1/4.  
- **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect because the probability for this path is 1/9, not 1/4.  
- **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the probability for this path is 1/3, not 2/3.

### Conclusion:
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.
