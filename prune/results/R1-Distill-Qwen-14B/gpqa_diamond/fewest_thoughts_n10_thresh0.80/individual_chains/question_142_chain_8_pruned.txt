Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through carefully.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find where this matrix is located geometrically in the space of qubits. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates (r values).

So, first, let me recall what a density matrix represents. A density matrix ρ is a positive semi-definite matrix with trace equal to 1. When a density matrix is a pure state, it can be written as |ψ><ψ|, but when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of pure states. The given ρ here is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That looks familiar—it's a mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability.

Wait, so this is a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. I remember that the maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, which has no coherence. So, in terms of the Bloch sphere representation, which is used to visualize qubit states, what does this look like?

The Bloch sphere is a way to represent all possible states of a single qubit. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. Each point inside the sphere corresponds to a density matrix. The maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere because it has zero purity. 

So, the center of the Bloch sphere is at the origin, right? So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Because in Bloch sphere coordinates, any point is given as (x,y,z), where (x,y,z) corresponds to the vector on the unit sphere scaled by the distance from the origin. For the completely mixed state, there's no preferred direction, so it's at the center.

Looking at the options now, option C is (0,0,0). So that must be the correct answer. The other options are points on the axes or outside the center. For example, option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the state |0>. Similarly, option A is (1,1,0), which would be some point on the equator, perhaps for a superposition state like (|0> + |1>)/√2. Option D is (1,1,1), which would be outside the Bloch sphere's surface, but density matrices can't have vectors outside because they are normalized.

Wait, but why is (0,0,0) the correct position? Because the maximally mixed state has no direction. Its density matrix is diagonal with entries ½ and ½, so the off-diagonal terms are zero. In the Bloch vector representation, the density matrix is written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. For a diagonal density matrix with equal diagonals, the Bloch vector r would be zero because the off-diagonal terms (which correspond to the x and y components) are zero, and the diagonal terms are (1 + z)/2 and (1 - z)/2. If both are ½, then z must be zero.

So, putting it all together, the density matrix given is the maximally mixed state, which is at the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0), which is option C.
