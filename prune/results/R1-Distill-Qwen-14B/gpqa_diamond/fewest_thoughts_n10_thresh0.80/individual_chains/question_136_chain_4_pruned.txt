Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm.

Wait, the divergence theorem comes into play here, right? Because the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux through the surface. So, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ f · da over the surface.

But wait, maybe I should compute the divergence first. Since the field is radial and depends only on r, I can probably use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. Oh right, for a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the radial component.

In this case, f(r) is 1/r². So f_r = 1/r². Let's plug into the divergence formula.

∇ · f = (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ). Let me compute the term inside the derivative first. r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = 0.

Wait, but wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, then the volume integral would be zero. But I'm integrating over a sphere of radius R. So, if the field is divergence-free except at the origin, which isn't included in the volume (assuming R is not zero), the integral would be zero.

Ah, but wait, what if the divergence isn't defined at
