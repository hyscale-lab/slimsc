Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester, but wait, no, wait. Oh right! When you have a bromide or iodide, especially a benzyl or allylic type, red phosphorus and HI can cause a substitution reaction. Hmm, wait, maybe it's more about elimination? Or maybe it's an example of a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, wait, no—I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Wait, no, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, or maybe the conversion of esters into something else. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial compound has an ester group. Because the IR spectrum shows a peak around 1720 cm-1, which is typical for an ester (C=O stretch). Also, the IR has a broad peak between 3400 and 2500, which might suggest O-H stretch from either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR in the question includes 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That could be due to an -OH group, or possibly an amide or something else. But let's see the NMR for more clues.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's quite upfield for an aldehyde proton, but more likely, this is an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. Or, could it be an aldehyde? Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a phenolic OH or an aldehyde. But if it's an aldehyde, then the peak is around 9-10, but 10.5 is a bit high. Alternatively, it's a carboxylic acid OH. Hmm.

But wait, if the compound has an ester and a carboxylic acid, that could complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Let's see.

The other peaks in the NMR:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets suggest two sets of aromatic protons, each with two H. So, maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, in para-methyl groups or something else.

Looking at the other signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a methine (CH) group adjacent to something else, perhaps a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group next to a carbonyl or something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of triplets? No, a doublet. Wait, 3H as a doublet. That suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2 or a CH that's split into a doublet. Maybe a geminal di-substitution? Or, perhaps a methyl group attached to a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, likely a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is an ester or a ketone attached to a benzene ring. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.
