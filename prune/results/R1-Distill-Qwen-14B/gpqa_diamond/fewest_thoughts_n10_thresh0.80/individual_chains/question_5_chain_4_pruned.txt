Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

The operator is called P, and it's a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The direction we're looking at is an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n lies in the x-z plane, which means its y-component must be zero. So n can be written as (nx, 0, nz), where nx² + nz² =1.

Wait, but the question is about finding the eigenvector of the operator P along this direction n. Oh, right! When they say "along an arbitrary direction", they're probably referring to the operator P being projected onto that direction. So the operator in question is P·n, which is the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n.

So the operator we're interested in is P·n = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. But since ny is zero, it simplifies to P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Each of the components P_x, P_y, and P_z are given. Let me write them down:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the P·n operator is (nx * P_x + nz * P_z) multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, actually, each component is already multiplied by ħ/2, so when we take nx P_x + nz P_z, it's (nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]]) all multiplied by ħ/2. Or wait, no. Let me see: P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix, so when I take nx P_x, that's nx * (ħ/2) * matrix. Same for nz P_z. So the entire expression is (nx * (ħ/2) * P_x_matrix) + (nz * (ħ/2) * P_z_matrix), which can be factored as (ħ/2) * (nx * P_x_matrix + nz * P_z_matrix).

But let me think about how to write the matrix for P·n. Let's compute it step by step.

P_x_matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z_matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P·n_matrix = nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]]
So that would be:

[ [nz*1, nx*1],
  [nx*1, nz*(-1)] ]

Then, the entire operator is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me write the eigenvalue equation:

P·n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Which is, in matrix terms:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a'; b']

Multiplying both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[nz a + nx b, nx a - nz b]^T = [a'; b']

So, we have two equations:

1. nz a + nx b = a'
2. nx a - nz b = b'

But since we're looking for an eigenvector, a' = (+ħ/2) a and same for b. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = eigenvalue |ψ>. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the equation is:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) * [a; b]

Wait, no. Wait, the operator is (ħ/2) * matrix, so when we set it equal to eigenvalue +ħ/2 times the vector, the equation is:

(ħ/2) * matrix * [a; b] = (+ħ/2) [a; b]

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to clear the factors:

matrix * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] multiplied by [a; b] equals [a; b].

So, the equations become:

nz a + nx b = a  --> nz a + nx b = a
nx a - nz b = b  --> nx a - nz b = b

Let me rearrange each equation.

From equation 1:
nz a + nx b = a → (nz -1) a + nx b = 0

From equation 2:
nx a - nz b = b → nx a - (nz +1) b = 0

So now we have the system:

(nz -1)a + nx b = 0
nx a - (nz +1) b = 0

Let me write these as:

(nz -1) a = -nx b → a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b

Similarly, from the second equation:

nx a = (nz +1) b → a = [ (nz +1)/ nx ] b

Wait, but for a and b not both zero, we can set the two expressions for a equal. So:

[ -nx/(nz -1) ] = [ (nz +1)/ nx ]

Cross-multiplying:

-nx * nx = (nz +1)(nz -1)

→ -nx² = nz² -1

Hmm, but since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, nx² + nz² =1.

So substituting, let's see:

We have: -nx² = nz² -1.

But from nx² + nz² =1 → nz² = 1 - nx².

Substituting into the equation:

-nx² = (1 - nx²) -1 → -nx² = -nx².

So it's an identity. That means the equations are dependent, and we have one equation to work with.

So going back, from equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b =0.

Let me pick one of the two expressions for a in terms of b. Let's take a = [ -nx/(nz-1) ] b.

But perhaps it's better to express a in terms of b.

Let me denote (nz-1) as D, then a = (-nx/D) b.

We can express the ratio a/b as (-nx)/(nz -1).

But perhaps it's easier to set b as a parameter and express a in terms of it.

Wait, but we can proceed further.

Since the direction n is arbitrary in x-z plane, let me express it in terms of angles. Let me think: Because n is in the x-z plane, we can write n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis.

So, nx = cosθ, nz = sinθ.

So, substituting into our earlier equations:

a = [ -nx/(nz-1) ] b → a = [ -cosθ/(sinθ - 1) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as a function of θ.

Wait, but let me compute sinθ -1. That is (sinθ -1), which can be written as -(1 - sinθ).

So,

a = [ -cosθ / ( -(1 - sinθ)) ] b → a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] b.

Hmm, perhaps we can rationalize this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

cosθ (1 + sinθ) / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] = cosθ (1 + sinθ) / (1 - sin²θ ) → cosθ (1 + sinθ) / cos²θ → (1 + sinθ)/cosθ.

So a = [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ] b.

So, a = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] b.

This can be rewritten as a = [ (sinθ/2 + cosθ/2 )^2 ] / (cosθ) * b? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can write it in terms of half-angle identities.

Wait, 1 + sinθ = 2 sin²(θ/2 + π/4) ? Let me think about trigonometric identities. Alternatively, 1 + sinθ = 2 sin^2 (θ/2 + π/4) is incorrect. Wait, maybe using the identity 1 + sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2 + π/4)^2. Alternatively, using tan(θ/2 + π/4) = something.

Alternatively, perhaps express (1 + sinθ)/cosθ as tan(θ/2 + π/4). Because:

tan(θ/2 + π/4) = [ tan(θ/2) + tan(π/4) ] / [ 1 - tan(θ/2) tan(π/4) ] → [ tan(θ/2) +1 ] / [ 1 - tan(θ/2) ]

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, let me think of (1 + sinθ)/cosθ = tan(π/4 + θ/2).

Because, using the identity:

tan(A + B) = [tan A + tan B ] / [1 - tan A tan B ]

Wait, let me compute tan(
