Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The options are various possible eigenvectors, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, no, the question actually says that the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, I think that means the operator we need to consider is the component of P along n. That would be the operator P · n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

So, the operator for the total P in the direction of n is given by P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n must be zero. So n_y = 0, right? Because any direction in the x-z plane has no y-component. So, the operator simplifies to P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but wait. The direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so n could be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis. Because, in the x-z plane, the direction is determined by the angle θ. So then, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y = 0. So the operator P_n is then P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but the question is asking for the eigenvector of this operator, P_n, corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvectors for P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, each of the components Px, Py, and Pz are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So let me write down each of these matrices.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]].
