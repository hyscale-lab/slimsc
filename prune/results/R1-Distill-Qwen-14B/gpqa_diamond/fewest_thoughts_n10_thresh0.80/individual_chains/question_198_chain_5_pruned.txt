Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Alright, let me read the problem again. The solution has Co(II) ions and SCN- ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) are given for different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because β usually decreases as the complex becomes more stable, right? Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, stability constants are the equilibrium constants for the formation of a complex. So, a higher β means a more stable complex. But in this case, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63), so the fourth complex is less stable than the third. That seems a bit odd. Or maybe the numbering is different.

Wait, the problem says it's the "dithiocyanato" complex. Dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ligands. So, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+ with n varying. Let me think: Co(II) could form complexes with multiple SCN- ions. So, the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, and [Co(SCN)_4]^−3 maybe? Or wait, I'm a bit confused about the charges.

Wait, Co(II) has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So, for each complex:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ would have 1 SCN. Charge: +2 + (-1) = +1. So the complex charge is +1, but wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}.

Let me think again: Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So, for n SCN- ions, the total charge would be +2 - n.

So, for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^{+1} (2-1=+1)

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (2-2=0)

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-1 (2-3=-1)

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^-2 (2-4=-2)

But the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. Because β3 is the highest, which would mean the third complex is the most stable. So which complex is the third?

If n=3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, that's the most stable with β3=63. And n=4 has β4=16, which is lower than β3. So the complexes are more stable up to n=3, and
