Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of how close a star is to us. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and another with 2 parsecs is 5 times closer (since distance = 1/plx). Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So if parallax is small, the distance is large.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed usually means that the number density is constant in space. So, if the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in a given volume of space would be proportional to the volume. But since we're dealing with parallax, I need to relate distance to parallax and then see how the number of stars per unit parallax interval changes.

Let me think about the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a shell between distance r and r + dr is 4πr² dr. Because each shell's volume depends on the square of the radius. Wait, so if the number of stars is uniform per unit volume, then the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to the volume, which is proportional to r² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Parallax plx is 1/r (since r = 1/plx, as plx is in arcseconds and r in parsecs). So, let me express everything in terms of plx.

Let's say plx = 1/r. So, r = 1/plx. The volume element is 4πr² dr. Substituting r in terms of plx, that's 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But wait, I need to express dr in terms of dplx (change in parallax) instead of dr. Because the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx.

So, since plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases,
