Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air, and this causes them to form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through some tubes.

Let me go through each part one by one.

First, the setup: the salts are heated, probably undergoing thermal decomposition. The gases produced are passed through three tubes. Tube 1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which I think absorbs water or other moisture. Tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution, which would react with acidic gases like CO2 or SO2, causing precipitation maybe. Tube 3 has red-hot copper, which probably reacts with gases like CO2 or something oxidizing, producing CuO.

The results: tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g. Tube 2 didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temp and pressure (which is STP, 0°C and 1 atm). 

Hmm, let's think about what each tube does. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong drying agent. It probably absorbs water vapor. So if the gas mixture has H2O, it would be absorbed here, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of H2O (3.60g). 

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas was CO2, it would react: CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3↓ + H2O. But since the weight of tube 2 didn't change, maybe no CO2 was present. Alternatively, perhaps the solution was in excess and didn't show a change in weight? Or maybe the gas that reacts isn't absorbed, but... Wait, if the gas was something like NH3, it would react with Ca(OH)2 but I'm not sure how the weight would change. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, but the problem says only a mixture of gases was formed. Let's consider the gases that could be formed when salts decompose. Common gases from such processes might be H2O (if the salts have hydroxides or something that dehydrates), CO2 (if carbonate salts decompose), SO2 (if sulfites or sulfates decompose), NH3 (if ammonium salts decompose), etc.

So, in this case, the gases passed through the first tube (Mg(ClO4)2) would dry them. If the gas is H2O, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, so the increase in weight (3.60g) would be the mass of H2O. So that's a possibility. Let's calculate: the mass of H2O is 3.60g. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol, so 3.60g /18=0.2 mol. So 0.2 moles of H2O were absorbed.

Next, the tube 3 has red-hot copper. If the gas is CO2, then CO2 + Cu (heated) → CuO + CO. Wait, no, actually, CO2 reacting with copper at high temperatures would produce CuO and CO. So for each mole of CO2, it would produce 1 mole of CuO. The mass gained in tube 3 is 0.80g. Let's calculate the moles of CuO formed. CuO's molar mass is 80 g/mol. So 0.80g is 0.01 mol. Hmm, wait, 0.80g /80 is 0.01mol. So that suggests 0.01 moles of CO2 reacted? Because each mole of CO2 gives one mole of CuO.

Wait, but let me think again: if the gas is CO2, then when it passes through red-hot copper, it would react. The reaction is
