Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's expressed in terms of dx and dy. So the spacetime here is (2-dimensional), probably a 2-manifold, and the metric is conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric (dx² + dy²).

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere, okay, that's like a hyperbolic space, right? In 2D, a pseudosphere would be a space with constant negative curvature. But wait, I'm a bit confused because usually, a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but maybe here it's referring to a 2D space with hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, the metric's denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks similar to the metric for a sphere but with a negative curvature. Because for a sphere, the metric in 3D is (R²)/(R² - r²) where r² is x² + y² + z², but this is in 2D. So perhaps the metric is for a hyperbolic plane or something like that.

Wait, let me think about the line element. The general form for a hyperbolic space in 2D is often written in different coordinates. For example, in Poincaré coordinates, the metric is usually (dr² + dz²)/z², but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, sometimes the metric for the hyperbolic plane is written as ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²), where R is the radius of curvature. But wait, in that case, the denominator would be a function of (x² + y²). So comparing to the given metric:

Given metric: (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So 4 is 2², so R² is 4. So R=2. So this seems to fit the form of a hyperbolic metric, where the denominator is (R² - (x² + y²)). So it's similar to the metric I was thinking of.

Wait, the pseudosphere in 2D is the hyperbolic plane, right? So the area in hyperbolic geometry is different. The area of a circle with radius r in hyperbolic space is 2π R sinh(r/R) - π r, I think. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas.

Wait, no, let me think again. The area of a circle in hyperbolic plane is 2π R sinh(r/R). But wait, here R is the curvature radius. Because for hyperbolic space, the Gaussian curvature is -1/(R²), so R is the radius of curvature. So in our case, R is 2 because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²) = (2² - (x² + y²)). So R=2.

The pseudosphere with radius r=2: Wait, wait, wait. The question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, but pseudosphere in 2D is a circle with a certain radius in the hyperbolic plane. Or maybe the radius here refers to the curvature radius? Hmm, the question might have a typo, but let's proceed.

Wait, maybe the term "pseudosphere" in the question refers to a 2-sphere in a space with different curvature. Wait no, pseudosphere is more like a hyperbolic surface, not a sphere with positive curvature. So the given metric is that of a hyperbolic plane with curvature radius R=2.

So the area of a circle (pseudosphere) of radius r in hyperbolic plane is 2π R sinh(r/R) - π r²? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle with radius r is 2π R sinh(r/R). So if R is 2, and the radius r is 2 as in the question, then the area would be 2π * 2 * sinh(2/2) = 4π sinh(1).

Wait, but wait, the options don't include any hyperbolic functions. The options are A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C) 4π(x²−y²), D) +infty. None of these have sinh functions. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total area of the entire pseudosphere. If this metric represents a hyperbolic plane, then the total area is infinite. Because like Euclidean plane, the hyperbolic plane is infinite in extent. So the area would be infinite. So the area of the entire pseudosphere (which is the whole hyperbolic plane) would be infinite.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Oh, so maybe it's not the entire space, but a specific region. Wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, the term "pseudosphere" might refer to an entire space, but perhaps here, the pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric describes a pseudosphere as a surface in 3D Minkowski space, but I don't think so because the metric is given in two dimensions.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the area can be calculated using the metric. The area element in the metric is (32)/(4−x²−y²) dx dy. So the area would be the integral of dx dy divided by (4−x²−y²) multiplied by 32. So to find the total area, we'd integrate over all x and y where the metric is defined, that is, where 4−x²−y² > 0. Because the denominator must be positive for real distances.

So the domain is x² + y² < 4. That's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the area would be the integral over this disk of (32)/(4−x²−y²) dx dy.

So to compute this, I can switch to polar coordinates. Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². The Jacobian determinant is r. So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dθ dr

The 32 and the r are outside the θ integral. The θ integral is from 0 to 2π, so:

∫ θ from 0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So the Area = ∫ (0 to 2) [32 * 2π / (4 - r²)] r dr

Simplify: 64π ∫ (0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr 

Hmm, let's compute this integral. Let me do substitution: Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

64π ∫ (u=4 to 0) [ ( -du/2 ) / u ] 

Which is 64π * (1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (1/u) (-du) ]

The negative sign flips the limits:

64π * (1/2) ∫ (0 to 4) (1/u) du

Which is 32π [ ln u ] from 0 to 4.

But wait, ln u evaluated at 0 is negative infinity. So the integral becomes 32π ( ln4 - ln0 ). But ln0 is negative infinity, so the integral diverges to +infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right because in the metric, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element becomes infinite. That would mean the total area is infinite.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, perhaps the pseudosphere is the entire space, so the area is infinite, hence option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the pseudosphere is. Another thought: in 3D, a pseudosphere is a tractricoid, which is a finite area surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm not sure how that applies in 2D.

Wait, but in the given metric, the space is two-dimensional, so the area is the integral over x and y, which we found to be infinite. So the answer should be D) +infty.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty, which would make sense if the area is infinite. So the correct answer should be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. This metric is conformally flat and resembles the metric of a hyperbolic plane, where the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) indicates a curvature radius \(R = 2\). The question asks for the area of the "pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\)." 

In this context, the pseudosphere likely refers to the entire hyperbolic plane described by the metric. To compute the total area, we calculate the integral of the area element \(dx \, dy\) weighted by the conformal factor \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\text{Area} = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\text{Area} = 32\pi \ln u \Big|_0^4 = 32\pi (\ln 4 - \ln 0).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). This divergence reflects the fact that the hyperbolic plane, described by the given metric, is infinite in extent. Therefore, the total area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)** and **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as these expressions do not represent the total area of the pseudosphere.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the total area of the pseudosphere (the entire hyperbolic plane) is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
