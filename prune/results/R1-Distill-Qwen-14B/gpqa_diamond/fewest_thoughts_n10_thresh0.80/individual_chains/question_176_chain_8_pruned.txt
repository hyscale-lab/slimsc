Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The state of the system is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a complex Hilbert space. Oh, but these elements are real numbers. Maybe it's a real vector space. I'm not sure if that matters right now.

So, the system's state is a vector, let's call it |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. The operators for P and Q are given as matrices. The first step is to find the probability of measuring P=0 and Q=-1 when measuring Q after P.

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the operator. So, if I first measure P, the state will collapse into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue, and then measuring Q on this new state.

But the question is about the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1. So, I need to find the probability that P is measured to be 0, and after the state collapses, Q is measured to be -1.

Alternatively, wait, maybe it's the joint probability of first measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 in the subsequent measurement. So, the steps are:

1. Find the possible eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.

2. Find the eigenvalue 0 of P, find the eigenvector(s) associated with it.

3. Compute the probability that the initial state |ψ> is projected onto that eigenvector.

4. Then, in the new state (which is the eigenvector from step 2), compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.

Wait, but let me double-check: the order is first P, then Q. So, after measuring P=0, the state becomes the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0, and then Q is measured on this new state.

So, let's start with operator P. The matrix given is:

P = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
       [1/sqrt(2), 0
