Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, since each is 2e, each charge is 2 * 1.6e-19 C, so 3.2e-19 C each. Oh wait, but actually, e is 1.6e-19, so 2e would be 3.2e-19 C per particle.

The setup is an isolated system. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So I imagine point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the configuration is a central charge with 12 others arranged around it, each at 2 meters.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, wait, electric potential energy... I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But in this case, the charges are fixed, except for the 13th which is fixed at P. Wait, wait, noâ€”the 13th is fixed at P, so the other 12 are at 2m from P. So the system's potential energy
