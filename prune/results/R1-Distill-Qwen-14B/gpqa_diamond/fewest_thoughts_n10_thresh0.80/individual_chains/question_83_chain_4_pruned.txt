Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Alright, let's break it down. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I should calculate the new concentration after dilution. 

Wait, when you dilute a solution, the amount of moles remains the same, right? Because you're just adding more solvent. So the initial moles of acetic acid would be volume (in liters) multiplied by molarity. The volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. 

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles divided by volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

First, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

So the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach equivalence would be moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. 

Wait, but the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. The titration volume is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, the total solution is 40 +10 = 50 cm³. 

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The initial solution is 40 cm³ (20+20), and we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, making 50 cm³ total. So the equivalence point occurs when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base. 

At equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic. 

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH from that. 

The moles of sodium acetate would be equal to the moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001 moles. The total volume is 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me calculate that accurately: 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. 

The Kb is 5.405e-10. Now
