Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but I think I can figure this out step by step.

First, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Alright, let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the initial step: diluting the acetic acid. When you mix two solutions, the volume increases, so the concentration decreases. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid. So the total volume is 40 cm³. Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute, wait. Oh right, no, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ of acetic acid plus 20 cm³ of water gives a total volume of 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be (volume_initial * concentration_initial) / total_volume.

That's (20 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 20 * 0.05 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. So when we dilute it, it dissociates more, but maybe I don't need to worry about that at the moment. The next step is titration. So when I titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion.

But before that, at 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Wait, so first I need to find out how much acetic acid is present in the diluted solution. Then find out how much NaOH is added at 25% of the equivalence point.

Let me think about the moles. The diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Moles of CH3COOH = M * V (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

When titrating, the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is equal to the moles of acetic acid. So, moles NaOH needed for equivalence = 0.001 mol.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, because when you titrate, the NaOH is added from a
