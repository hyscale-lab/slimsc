Alright, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Klinefelter's syndrome and why its phenotypic consequences are less severe compared to Down's syndrome. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again. So, the question is asking about a molecular mechanism responsible for the less severe symptoms of Klinefelter's compared to Down's. The options given are A to D, each involving different molecular processes.

I remember that Klinefelter's syndrome occurs in males when there's an extra X chromosome, typically resulting in an XXY karyotype. Down's syndrome is due to trisomy 21, where there's an extra chromosome 21. Both are caused by errors during meiosis, but their outcomes are different.

Now, why are the effects of Klinefelter's less severe? Let me think. I think it's because the extra X in Klinefelter's is inactivated. Oh, right! Females have two Xs and one is inactivated through a process called X inactivation. In males with Klinefelter's, the extra X is usually inactivated, much like in females. So, the cells only have one active X, preventing severe issues since the extra X doesn't contribute much beyond the normal gene expression.

In contrast, Down's syndrome involves an extra chromosome 21. Since chromosome 21 isn't inactivated, all the extra genes are expressed, leading to more severe and obvious developmental issues.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote. That sounds like it's about gene regulation. Maybe this relates to X inactivation? Or perhaps to some other epigenetic changes after the zygote forms. But I'm not sure how this directly ties to the phenotypic severity.

Option B: Progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst. Polymerase alpha is involved in DNA replication, like during the synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Not sure how this would relate to the phenotypic consequences of these syndromes.

Option C: Attachment of spindle to kinetochores in metaphase I. That's part of the process during meiosis where chromosomes are aligned. If the attachment is incorrect, it can lead to nondisjunction, which causes conditions like Down's or Klinefelter's. But how does this explain the severity difference? Maybe if the error occurs, the mechanism here would determine whether it's trisomy or something else, but not the severity.

Option D: Chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis. Chiasmata are the points where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material during meiosis I. Separase is an enzyme that cleaves cohesion proteins, allowing sister chromatids to separate. If the resolution is incorrect, it can lead to non-disjunction. But again, how does this affect the severity?

Wait, the question is about why Klinefelter's is less severe. The key is that the extra X is inactivated. X inactivation involves the formation of a Barr body, which is the condensed inactive X. XIST RNA plays a role in this process.

Looking for the mechanism that leads to the inactivation of the extra X. So perhaps the process involves the XIST gene, which is responsible for initiating X inactivation. But none of the options directly mention XIST or the inactivation process.

Alternatively, maybe the answer relates to how the extra chromosome is handled. In Klinefelter's, the extra X is inactivated, so the cell behaves more like a normal male cell with one X contributing genes. But in Down's, the extra chromosome 21 doesn't get inactivated, so all its genes are expressed.

Now, the options: option A talks about chromatin methylation. I think X inactivation involves adding methyl groups to the chromatin, which silences the genes on the inactive X. Histone methyltransferases add methyl groups to histones, leading to chromatin condensation and gene silencing. So if the extra X is methylated, its genes aren't expressed, which would reduce the effect.

So option A could be the molecular mechanism responsible. Because the extra X in Klinefelter's is methylated, the phenotypic consequences are less severe.

Alternatively, looking at the other options, which one is directly involved in X inactivation?

Wait, option D is about chiasmata resolution. Chiasmata are formed during meiosis I when homologous chromosomes exchange. If resolution is incorrect, it can lead to nondisjunction. But that's about the formation of the syndrome, not the phenotype's severity.

So, back to the question: the molecular mechanism making Klinefelter's less severe is the inactivation of the extra X, which involves chromatin methylation. Therefore, option A is about chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases. That would be the mechanism.

Wait, but wait. When does this methylation happen? X inactivation occurs early in embryonic development, around the blastocyst stage. So, if the methylation is post-zygote, as option A states, that would happen during the early cell divisions after fertilization. That makes sense because the zygote would have the XXY chromosomes, and during development, the extra X would be inactivated, leading to less severe symptoms.

So, the correct answer would be option A.


Klinefelter's syndrome results from an extra X chromosome (XXY) in males, while Down's syndrome arises from trisomy 21. The phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome are less severe because the extra X chromosome is inactivated through a process called X inactivation. This inactivation involves chromatin methylation, where histone methyltransferases add methyl groups to histones, leading to the silencing of genes on the inactive X chromosome. This reduces the expression of the extra X's genes, mitigating the severity of the syndrome.

In contrast, Down's syndrome involves an extra chromosome 21 that is not inactivated, resulting in the overexpression of all its genes and leading to more severe developmental issues. Among the options provided, chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases (option A) directly explains the molecular mechanism responsible for the reduced severity of Klinefelter's syndrome.
