Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. Alright, let's see what the problem says.

There are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, I don't think the masses are directly relevant to the problem here. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe the mass is a red herring. Or perhaps it's for context about stellar evolution, but I'm not sure. Let's focus on the given data.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The values provided are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has these values:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. The way the problem states the Sun's composition is: 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals some value. So for Fe, it's 7.5. So the log is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5) ≈ 1e-5.

But I'm not sure if I need that for each star. Let's see.

The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so [Si/Star_1] over [Si/Star_2], or the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2)?

Wait, wait. Wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms. So I need to find (nSi1)/(nSi2).

But how do I get nSi for each star?

I think I'll need to use the given abundance ratios. Let me list out the given data again.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log(Si/Fe) = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.
- [Fe/H
