Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a muon(+) and a neutrino. So the reaction is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think in most cases, their rest mass is considered negligible. So for the purposes of this problem, the neutrino's rest mass is zero. That should simplify things a bit.

Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum must still be zero because of conservation of momentum. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are equal, and their directions are opposite.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic because its rest mass is zero. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. So, let me denote the muon's kinetic energy as K and the neutrino's as K_nu.

So the energy conservation equation would be:
m_pi * c^4 = (m_mu * c^4 + K) + (K_nu)

Because the neutrino has no rest mass, its energy is just K_nu. But since energy and momentum are conserved, I can relate them through the equation involving momentum.

The total momentum before is zero, so the muon's momentum p and the neutrino's momentum p' must satisfy p = -p'. So the magnitudes are equal: p_mu = p_nu.

The energy of a particle is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m
