Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry isomers, specifically optical isomerism, which I think is the same as enantiomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. These compounds are optically active, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing some of these moieties.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the two benzene rings rotating with respect to each other. But wait, for biphenyls to have stereoisomerism, the substituents must be in positions that prevent free rotation. So the substituents here are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Wait, the main chain is 1,1'-biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected at position 1. The substituents are 6,6' dinitro and 2,2' dicarboxylate groups. 

In biphenyl compounds, the possibility of having enantiomers arises if the substituents are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure: each benzene has a nitro group at 6, and a carboxylate at 2. Since the substituents are at positions that are across the ring (like 2 and 6), their positions on each ring would be across from each other. But wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, could that lead to stereoisomerism? Alternatively, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then there could be enantiomers. 

I think that if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it would show optical isomerism. For example, if the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions are not symmetric. Since this has two nitro groups at 6 and two carboxylates at 2 on each ring, perhaps this creates a chiral center? Wait, no, because the biphenyl itself doesn't have a chiral center. Wait, maybe the substituents cause the molecule to have chirality through the arrangement of the groups in space. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system has a center of asymmetry. Let me think: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not mirror images of each other, then the biphenyl could have enantiomers. For instance, in 1,2-dimethylbiphenyl, the substituents are on adjacent positions, leading to possible isomerism. But in this case, substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, 6 is opposite to 1 on the benzene ring. So each ring has substituents at 2,6, and 1 (the bridge). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe it's best to think that this compound could have enantiomers because the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetric. I'll tentatively say that 1 does show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbon chain is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Let's count the carbons. The molecule is like:

      O
      |
CH2-C-O-OCH3
      |
      OH

Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is:

CH2-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, so the central carbon (second carbon) has OH, CH3 (from the first carbon), COOCH3 (from the third), and another CH2 group? Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that can't be right. Let me write the formula.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxypropanoate would have an OH on the second carbon.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, the parent chain is propanoate, so the chain is three carbons: COOCH3 is on the third carbon, and the second carbon has OH. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. But wait, that can't be right because the second carbon is CH2OH and the third is COOCH3. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But wait, wait, that's not possible because the propanoate has the COO- on the third carbon. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2OH

Carbon 2
