Okay, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to figure out which plasmid to use.

Hmm, the goal is to produce the protein, right? So the plasmid must have the correct gene for that. But wait, plasmids usually contain the DNA sequence, not the protein. So I need to look at the DNA sequences in each option and see which one correctly codes for the given amino acid sequence.

Wait, the question is about choosing the correct plasmid. I remember that when cloning a gene into a plasmid, the reading frame and codon usage are important. E. coli uses certain codon preferences, so the plasmid's sequence should match that for efficient expression.

Looking at the options, A, B, C, D. I see they're all long DNA sequences starting with ATG, which is the start codon. So each is a coding sequence. But I need to find which one has the correct coding sequence for the Human P53 protein.

Another thing I'm thinking is that the correct plasmid should have the same reading frame as the given amino acid sequence. So the translation should match exactly. Also, the plasmids might differ in the presence of stop codons or other sequences.

Wait, maybe I should look for the presence of in-frame stop codons. If any of the plasmids have a stop codon (like TAG
