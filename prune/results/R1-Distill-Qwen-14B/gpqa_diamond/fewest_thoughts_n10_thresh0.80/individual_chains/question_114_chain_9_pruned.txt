Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's break it down. I'm going to try to think it through step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), I'm thinking about nucleophilic addition. Wait, but ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition with something like HCN, but NaCN is more of a source of CN- ions. Oh wait, but in the presence of an acid catalyst maybe?

Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN. Oh, wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with cyanide ions in a basic or acidic condition. Oh, right, the reaction is typically done under acidic conditions. So the mechanism would be that the ketone's carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Then water leaves, but wait, in this case, would it form an alcohol and a nitrile?

Wait, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with CN- would add CN to the carbonyl. So the product would have an -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon. Oh right, so the product is a geminal diol? No, wait, probably a cyanohydrin. So the formula would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the product.

So for this reaction, the conditions are usually using an acid catalyst. So reagent A is probably H3O+ (like HCl or another strong acid). Or wait, maybe it's a base? No, in cyanohydrin formation, acid is used to protonate the carbonyl. So reagent A is H3O+? Or is it another source?

Wait, the options for A include H3O+ and NaHSO3. H3O+ is just a proton source, like HCl, H2SO4, etc. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3^- and can act as a mild reducing agent, but I'm not sure.

In the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which requires adding CN- to the carbonyl. So the conditions are probably acidic. So I think reagent A is H3O+ (like HCl), so in the first part, A would be H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me parse that. It's a four-carbon chain,
