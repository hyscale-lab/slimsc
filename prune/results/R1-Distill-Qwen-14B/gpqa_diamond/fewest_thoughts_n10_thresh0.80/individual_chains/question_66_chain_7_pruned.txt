Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let me start by recalling what I know about symmetries and SMEFT.

SMEFT is an effective theory that encapsulates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. These operators are built using the SM fields and are organized by dimension. The SM itself has certain symmetries that any extension must respect, but SMEFT adds higher-dimensional terms, so I need to think about which symmetries these terms must adhere to.

The question is asking which of the listed symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me go through each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. SMEFT is built as an effective theory, so all its operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense because Lorentz symmetry is crucial for relativistic invariance. So operator terms in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. So I think Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely one that must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SMEFT is a field theory, which by nature is Poincare-invariant because it's a local theory. Wait, but in effective field theories, do we assume Poincare symmetry? Well, since the SM is a Poincare-invariant theory, the SMEFT, which is an effective extension, should also respect Poincare symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must transform properly under Poincare. Wait, but wait a second. Wait, in SMEFT, are the operators constructed in a way that respects Poincare? Because the SM operators do, so yes. But wait, the question is about which symmetries are "must be respected by all operators." So if the operators are built from SM fields which already respect Poincare, then yes, the operators must respect it as well.

Wait, but another angle: the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories can sometimes break certain symmetries if the high-energy theory doesn't have them, but in this case, SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM
