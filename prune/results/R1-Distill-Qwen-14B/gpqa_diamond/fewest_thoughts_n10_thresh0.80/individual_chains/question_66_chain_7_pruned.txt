Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think through each symmetry and see which ones are required.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension, with the Standard Model being the renormalizable part (dimension 4), and SMEFT includes higher dimensions (like dimension 6, 8, etc.).

Now, about symmetries. Symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the laws and the interactions. So the operators in SMEFT must respect certain symmetries of the Standard Model. 

Lorentz symmetry is one of the fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model. It includes rotations and boosts, ensuring that the laws of physics are the same for all observers regardless of their constant velocity. Since the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, any effective theory like SMEFT must also respect it. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So it's a broader symmetry. But in the Standard Model and SMEFT, the symmetry is usually considered as the SM group, which includes Poincare. But wait, SMEFT is just an effective theory. Does it require all operators to respect Poincare? Well, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translational symmetries. Since SMEFT is built upon the SM which has these, I think all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Or do they?

Wait, no. SMEFT operators are built from the SM fields, and the SM already respects Poincare. So the operators in SMEFT are constructed to maintain the same symmetries as the SM, including Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare. So option 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait. Are all operators in SMEFT Poincare-invariant? Because the operators are local, meaning they have derivatives that allow for Lorentz and translation invariance. So yes, they must be. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Then, CP symmetry. The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric. The CKM matrix has phases leading
