Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. I'm a bit rusty on my synthesis pathways, so I need to think carefully.

First, I'll try to understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a bromine, and at position 5, a nitro group. Additionally, the ethanone group (a ketone) is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is a benzene ring where one carbon is attached to a ketone (COCH3?), but wait, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- so the ketone is on the benzene ring, meaning the ring has a substituent where the position is attached to a carbonyl group. So the benzene ring has three substituents: at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the position where the ketone is attached. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3CO-, so the structure is a benzene ring with a COCH3 group attached. So, the substituents are Br at position 3, NO2 at 5, and COCH3 at position 1? Wait, no, the numbering would be relative. Let me think: the ketone is at position 1, which is where the substituent is attached. Then the bromine is at position 3 and nitro at position 5, relative to the ketone group. So the substituents are meta to each other, and the ketone is in the para position relative to Br and nitro? Wait, no, perhaps the ketone is at position 1, and the substituents at 3 and 5. Let me imagine the benzene ring: the ketone is in position 1. Then positions 2 is adjacent, 3 is next, 4 is opposite, etc. So position 3 is meta to position 1, and position 5 would be
