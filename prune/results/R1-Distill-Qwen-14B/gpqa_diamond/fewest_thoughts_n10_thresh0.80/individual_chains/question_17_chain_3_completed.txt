Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M. The problem gives me the formation constant, KCa-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I guess that means we don't have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or anything.

Hmm, right. I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the formation constant (Kf) tells us how stable the complex is. The formula for Kf is [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]). But wait, in this case, EDTA is the ligand, and Ca²+ is the metal, so the complex is Ca-EDTA^2- or something like that.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, so that probably means the ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1 because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and typically forms complexes with a 1:1 ratio. So the complex, let's call it CaEDTA²−, has a concentration of 0.02 M.

But wait, when the complex dissociates, it will release Ca²+ and EDTA^4− ions. Wait, no, actually, EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form when it's binding to metals. So in solution, the EDTA is present as Y^4−, and the calcium forms a complex with it.

Wait, but the formation of the complex is reversible. So the reaction would be something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²− 

And the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5x10^10. Right, that's a very large Kf, which means the complex is very stable, so the dissociation isn't significant. But wait, the question is asking about the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So if the complex is very stable, most of the Ca²+ would be tied up in the complex, and the free Ca²+ would be very low.

Wait, but the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, let's think about the dissociation. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−, the concentration of each will be x. But wait, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so if x is the concentration that dissociates, then the concentration of [CaEDTA²−] would be 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large (5e10), x would be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, setting up the equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

But I think I might have missed something. Wait, no, in this case, the initial solution only has the complex, right? Because it's a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, so the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are zero, and all the complex comes from the dissociation of the complex. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the complex is in solution, and it dissociates into some Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But wait, the formation of the complex would depend on the concentrations.

Wait, maybe I should model it as:

The solution has 0.02 M of CaEDTA²−. When this complex dissociates, it produces 1 mole of Ca²+ and 1 mole of EDTA^4− per mole of complex. So, the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The formation constant Kf is the inverse of the dissociation constant Kd. Because Kf is formation, so Kd (dissociation) is 1/Kf.

Wait, right, because Kf = [complex]/([M][L]) and Kd = [M][L]/[complex], so Kd = 1/Kf. So here, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, for the dissociation, the expression is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA²−] = 2e-11.

Let me set up variables. Let the concentration of Ca²+ be x. Since the dissociation produces equal amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− (because the stoichiometry is 1:1), [EDTA^4−] would also be x. And the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x. But since Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, substituting into the equation:

Kd ≈ (x)(x) / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So, x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. The formation constant is given as Kf = 5e10. So the dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf = 2e-11.

2. The dissociation is CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. So the equilibrium expression is [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA²−] = Kd.

3. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium. Thus, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x, and [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 M (since x is very small).

4. Plugging into the equation: x² / 0.02 = Kd = 2e-11.

5. So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

6. x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

That's about 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation constant \( K_d \), which is the reciprocal of the formation constant \( K_f \). Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate \( K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \).

The dissociation of the complex is represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) at equilibrium be \( x \). Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) is also \( x \), and the concentration of the complex \( \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \) is approximately \( 0.02 - x \). Given that \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \) is negligible compared to 0.02, so \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \).

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
