Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, C3H6 is propene because cyclopropane would be C3H6 too. Oh wait, no, cyclopropane is C3H6 as well, but maybe the way it's used here matters. Wait, but then it undergoes bromination in CCl4. Oh right, that's probably an addition reaction. So Compound A is propene, which is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Or maybe it's 1-propene, but I think in any case, it's an alkene.

So, bromination of propene in CCl4 would probably involve adding Br2 across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacting with Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, wait. Adding Br2 to propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would give 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3). Oh wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so when Br2 adds across the double bond, it would be adding Br to each carbon. So, it would become CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait: propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2-CHBr-CH3. Yeah, that makes sense.

So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In such conditions, elimination reactions typically happen. So, it's probably an E2 elimination. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating HBr from adjacent carbons would form an alkene.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. So when KOH (alcoholic) is added, it should abstract a Î²-hydrogen, and the
