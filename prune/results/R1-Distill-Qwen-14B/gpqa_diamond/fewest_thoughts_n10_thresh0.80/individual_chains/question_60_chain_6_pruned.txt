Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation, I think. So, the scenario is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that travels at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. Oh wait, their astronaut is 22 years old, so from Earth's perspective, he might have a long time to live, but from his own perspective, it's different because of relativity.

The question asks how long it will take for the 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth, according to his own time. So, it's about the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

I remember from my studies that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. There are two main effects: time dilation from the perspective of a stationary observer (like someone on Earth), and the astronaut's own experienced time, which is shorter due to their high speed.

Wait, so the astronaut's own clock will run slower compared to someone observing from Earth. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Or is it? Let me think. Time dilation is when a moving clock (from the perspective of a stationary observer) runs slower. So, when the spacecraft is moving at a high speed relative to Earth, Earth's observers would see the astronaut's clock running slow. But from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving, and the Earth's clocks are running slow. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The problem states that the spacecraft is traveling at a constant speed, so it's in an inertial frame. So, from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving away at 0.99999987c. The trip's duration from the astronaut's perspective is less than what Earth observers would say because of the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but the problem is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's point of view. So, the question is about the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler.

So, the formula for time dilation is proper time (tau) equals
