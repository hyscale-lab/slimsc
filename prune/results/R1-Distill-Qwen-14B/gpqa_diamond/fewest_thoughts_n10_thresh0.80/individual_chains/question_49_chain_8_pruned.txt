Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about sigmatropic rearrangements. There are three reactions given, and I need to determine the products A, B, and C based on the options provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this might be a Cope or Claisen rearrangement. Wait, no, Cope is for 1,5-dienes, and Claisen is for allyl vinyl ethers. Wait, but the starting material here is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw the structure.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the structure where ethanamine has two methoxy groups attached to the same carbon (the amine is on C1, two methoxy on same C1). So the structure is (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Oh wait, no. Wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CHNH2. So the structure is:

O
||
OCH2C(CH3)2NH2 ?

Wait, no. Wait, the ethanamine is CH2CH2NH2, but with two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2CH-CH2NH2? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon (the NH2-bearing carbon). So it's (CH3O)2CHNH2? Or is it (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Wait, perhaps it's (CH3O)2CH-CH2NH2? No, that would be on the second carbon. Oh wait, ethanamine is NH2CH2CH3. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be on the first carbon (the one attached to NH2). So, OCH3 groups on the same carbon as NH2. So structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2-CH3? No, wait, maybe it's (OCH3)2CH-NH2. So the central carbon is connected to two OCH3 groups, an NH2, and another CH3? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2. No, that would be 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

     O
     |
OCH2-C-NH2
     |
     CH3

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the structure: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So the ethanamine is CH2NH2CH3. The first carbon (attached to NH2
