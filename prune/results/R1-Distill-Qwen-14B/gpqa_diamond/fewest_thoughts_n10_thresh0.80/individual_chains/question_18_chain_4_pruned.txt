Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I remember that the notation like [Si/Fe] is about the logarithm of the ratio of their abundances relative to the Sun. Let me think step by step.

Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times the solar ratio. Wait, because the [X/Y] notation is log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

But wait, in this case, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So Si/Fe ratio in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times the solar ratio. So Star_1 has more silicon relative to iron than the Sun does.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. This means Mg/Si in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times solar. So Mg is more abundant relative to Si in Star_2.

Wait, but I also need the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for each star. Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means its iron abundance is the same as the Sun. So Fe/H ratio is same as solar. Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so Mg/H ratio is same as solar.

I think I need to find [Si/H] for both stars, then take the ratio.

Let me recall the definitions. [X/H] is log10(N_X / N_H) - log10(N_X/N_H)_sun.

Wait, but wait, the Sun's photosphere has certain values. The problem gives for the Sun:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) =7.5 -12 = same as Fe? Wait no, the problem says 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(Mg/H) =7 -12= -5 → Mg/H =10^-5.

Wait, wait. Let me see: the given data is:

For the Sun:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So for the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, same as [Mg/H] is 0.

Now, moving to Star_1: [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe/H is same as Sun. So nFe1/nH1 = 1e-4.5 (since solar is 1e-4.5, but [Fe/H] is 0, so same ratio.)

Wait, no: [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H in star) minus (Fe/H in Sun). So if [Fe/H] is 0, then (Fe/H) star = (Fe/H) sun. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has
