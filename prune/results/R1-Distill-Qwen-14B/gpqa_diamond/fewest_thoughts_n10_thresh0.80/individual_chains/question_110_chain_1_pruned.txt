Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory. The key points given are the brightness limits for each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can detect stars up to 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so up to 16 mag. So a star must have an apparent magnitude (V) that is less than or equal to 16 mag for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 mag for ESPRESSO. Wait, no—wait, the question says "brighter than" so the actual limit is stars with V mag less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So a brighter star has a lower magnitude number. So if a star is, say, mag 15, that's brighter than mag 17.

So the star needs to be bright enough to be seen by both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 (since HIRES can't see beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go up to 17). So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be detected by both.

But wait, the stars given don't all have apparent magnitudes. Some have absolute magnitudes. So I'll need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star where necessary.

Let me look at each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. What's its apparent mag? The formula to compute apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 +5 log10(d) (where d is distance in parsecs). So for Star1: m = 15.5 +5 +5 log(10) = 15.5 +5 +5*1 = 20.5 mag. Wait, that's way dimmer than either telescope's limit. So Star1's apparent V is 20.5, which is way beyond both 16 and 17. So Star1 can't be detected by either. So it's out.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5. So for HIRES, which can go up to 16, 16.5 is too dim. Wait, because HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, meaning m ≤16. So 16.5 is beyond that. So Star2 can't be seen by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so Star2 is within ESPRESSO's limit. But since it can't be seen by HIRES, it's out of the possible answers. So Star2 is not a candidate.

Star3: Apparent V mag 15.5, but wait, the given data includes E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. Oh, right, that's the color excess,
