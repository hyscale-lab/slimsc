Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. Let me try to unpack this step by step. Hmm, the question gives me five stars with various properties, and I need to figure out which two can be observed by both instruments.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like exoplanet detection. The key here is the apparent V magnitude each star has, because the spectrographs have different brightness limits. Let me see what the limits are again. Oh right, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So, the star's apparent V magnitude has to be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES, and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. But wait, no, wait. Because the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, I think I got that the wrong way around. Magnitude works so that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's better than 17. Like, if a star has apparent V magnitude of 16, that's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, meaning that any star with V <=17 can be detected. Wait, no, wait again. Because the way it's phrased is, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, so if a star is brighter (lower magnitude number) than 17, then it's observable. So any star with V <17 is okay for ESPRESSO. Similarly for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed, so V <16.

Wait, correction: The phrasing is "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So if a star's apparent V is less than 17, it's brighter than 17, so it's observable. Similarly, for
