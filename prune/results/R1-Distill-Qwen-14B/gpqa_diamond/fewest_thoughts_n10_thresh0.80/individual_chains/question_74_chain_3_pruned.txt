Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about the decay of a single atom. They told us that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, for this atom, there's a 32% chance it'll decay in the first 100 minutes. Now, we're at 50 minutes, and it hasn't decayed yet. The question is asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key thing here is that the decay process is memoryless. That means the probability of the atom decaying in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. So, even though 50 minutes have gone by without the atom decaying, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we were starting fresh, considering the right time frame.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because 150 minutes is more than the initial 100-minute period. So maybe I need to think in terms of half-lives or the decay constant.

Let me try to recall the formula. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life T½ by the equation λ = ln(2)/T½. But in this case, the given probability is 32% (0.32) over 100 minutes. So the general decay formula is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t). Because P(t) is the probability of decay by time t.

Wait, yes, that's right. So the given probability is 0.32 when t=100 minutes. So I can set up the equation:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

Which simplifies to e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100. Let me compute that. I think ln(0.68) is approximately... let's see, ln(0.5) is about -0.
