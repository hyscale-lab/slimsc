Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me read the question again carefully. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. That means the aromatic ring has two substituents, and the overall structure has 8 carbons.

The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the molecule has both a carbonyl (like a ketone or maybe an ester) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure. The ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons because the total is 8. So each substituent could be a single carbon, or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is none? No, di-substituted means two substituents. So each substituent is a single group.

Wait, wait. Wait, the ring has six carbons. If the compound has eight carbons in total, that means the substituents contribute two carbons. So each substituent is one carbon, or one substituent is two carbons. Wait, but di-substituted would imply two substituents. So maybe one substituent is -OCH3 or something like that. Hmm, no, because that's one substituent. Oh wait, maybe one substituent is a nitro group (but that's no carbons) or a carbonyl group attached. Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group) and a halogen.

Wait, but halogens like Cl, Br, etc. don't have carbons. So if the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen, but that would only add one substituent with a carbon (like an acetyl, which is -COCH3, which is two carbons) and a halogen (no carbons). So the ring would have substituents: one is -COCH3 (adding two carbons) and the other is a halogen (Cl, Br, etc., adding zero carbons). So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 2 (from COCH3) = 8. That fits. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (like an acetyl) and a halogen.

So the structure is benzene with two substituents: one is an acetyl group (COCH
