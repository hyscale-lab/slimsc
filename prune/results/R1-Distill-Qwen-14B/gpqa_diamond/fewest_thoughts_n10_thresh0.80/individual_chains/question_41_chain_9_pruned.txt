Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through glass, and the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember something about the speed of light in different frames. Wait, the problem mentions the glass is moving, so I think this is a scenario involving relative motion. But wait, light's speed in a medium... Oh, right, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's index of refraction. Oh wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, where c is the vacuum speed and n is the index. So normally, in the rest frame of the glass, light's speed would be c/n, right?

But here, the glass itself is moving. So I need to consider how the observer in the lab sees the speed of light in this moving glass. Oh, this sounds like a problem that involves the addition of velocities, maybe using special relativity. But wait, if v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab, and if v is much smaller than c, perhaps I can use the Galilean addition. But if v is not negligible, then I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but since the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. Wait
