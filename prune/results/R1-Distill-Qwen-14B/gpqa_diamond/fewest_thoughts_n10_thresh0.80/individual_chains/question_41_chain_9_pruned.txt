Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving relative to an observer. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, their properties like speed can change from the observer's perspective. Let me think about this.

Alright, the question says a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light within it as observed from outside doesn't just add up like velocities do for objects. Because light's speed isn't like a regular velocity—it's always c in a vacuum, right? But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

So, the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. The light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. The observer is in the lab frame, so we're looking at the speed from that frame.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light would be c/n, because the index of refraction reduces the speed. But when the glass is moving, we have to consider the velocity addition from special relativity, I think. Oh wait, but the options don't seem to involve any relativistic terms beyond simple fractions, so maybe it's treated non-relativistically.

Wait, no, if the glass is moving at velocity v, then the light's speed in the lab frame would be the speed in the glass frame plus v? But that can't be right because in vacuum, adding velocities like that would exceed c, which is impossible. But wait, inside the glass, the speed is lower than c. So perhaps we can use a non-relativistic approach here.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The speed of light in the moving glass (from the lab frame) can be found using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Or maybe it's not necessary because the glass's speed v is much smaller than c, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I shouldn't assume that.

The velocity addition formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of the object in the moving frame. But wait, no, the formula is for when you have a frame moving at speed v relative to the lab. So in this case, the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab, and in its own frame, the light is moving
