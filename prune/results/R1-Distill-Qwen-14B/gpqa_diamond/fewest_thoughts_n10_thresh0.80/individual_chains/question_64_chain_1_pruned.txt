Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about heating a mixture of two salts, A and B. They're equimolar, meaning the moles of A and B are the same. The total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, which probably means no oxygen is present, they decompose into a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through some tubes with specific chemicals.

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent, so it probably absorbs water. The second tube has a Ca(OH)2 solution, which would react with acidic gases like CO2. The third tube has red-hot copper, which I think reacts with certain gases like CO or maybe SO2 or something else.

The results show that tube 1 gained 3.60 grams. Since Mg(ClO4)2 is used for drying, the weight gain is likely due to water absorption. So maybe the gas has water vapor, which is captured here. 

Tube 3 gained 0.80 grams. Since it's red-hot copper, I think it's reacting with a gas. For example, CO might react with Cu to form CuO and CO2. If the weight increased, that suggests that the gas was something like CO, which gains oxygen from the copper. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with another gas, but CO is a common one.

Tube 2 didn't change, which suggests that the gas passing through didn't contain any acidic gases like CO2 or SO3, because Ca(OH)2 would react with those. If the gas didn't react, then maybe there's no CO2 or similar.

After these tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP is 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Hmm, let's think about what this could mean. The gases that didn't react with Ca(OH)2 might have been something like NH3, but wait, NH3 is a base and would react with Ca(OH)2, but that's a precipitate. Or maybe the gas is inert, like nitrogen or maybe O2, but O2 wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, but CO is a neutral gas and wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2 solution.

Wait, but in the third tube, the copper gained mass. If the gas was CO, then CO would react with Cu at high temperatures. The reaction would be: 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So, the copper oxide (CuO) is formed, which increases the tube's weight. So, for each mole of CO, you get one mole of CuO. 

So, the mass gained in tube 3 is 0.80 g. The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (Cu is 63.55, O is 16, total approx 79.55). Wait, 0.80 grams is about 0.01 moles. Because 0.8 /80 is 0.01. So, 0.01 moles of CuO formed, which implies that 0.01 moles of CO reacted because the reaction is 2CO → 1 CuO (maybe I should check the stoichiometry again). Let me think: the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So, for every 2 moles of CO, you get 1 mole of CuO. So, if 0.01 moles of CuO formed, that means 0.02 moles of CO reacted. 

Wait, but wait: The mass of CuO is 0.80 g. Molar mass of
