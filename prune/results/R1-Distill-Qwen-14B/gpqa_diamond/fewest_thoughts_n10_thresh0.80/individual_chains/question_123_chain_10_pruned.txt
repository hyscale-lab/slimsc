Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so that means the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s as per the Galaxy's frame, right? Because in relativity, the speed from one frame to another is the same but in opposite directions. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, which implies that from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That makes sense because if I'm in the ejecta, I see the Galaxy coming towards me at high speed, so from the Galaxy's view, I'm coming towards them at the same speed.

Now, the question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? So, I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, but time isn't the same in both frames. Oh, so I can't just directly multiply speed by time
