Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what I've got here. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR and NMR data should help me figure this out.

First, the FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's a key point. Esters also have an oxygen in the carbonyl and another oxygen typically from the OR group. So the formula must include an ester functional group. The formula options all have O2, so that's consistent.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The spectrum shows six signals. Let's break down each part:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Aromatic protons usually give multiple peaks due to substituents. Since it's a di-substituted ring, the substituents might be in positions that cause different coupling. For example, if the substituents are meta, the protons would be equivalent in pairs. Or maybe para, but since it's di-substituted, I think maybe it's 1,3 or 1,4 positions. Alternatively, if the substituents are identical, the ring could have symmetry. Wait, but the two signals for aromatic-H suggest that there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, which would have two equivalent sets of protons if the substituents are in the para positions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if it's a di-substituted benzene, say with two substituents in the para positions (1,4), then the aromatic protons would be in two sets. Each ring position would have equivalent Hs. So H in position 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So two signals. That makes sense.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in alkenes or double bonds. Since one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets, maybe the structure has a vinyl group adjacent to an ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. Wait, but esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R or R-O-CO-R. Hmm, wait, esters are RCOOR', so maybe the substituent is an acyl group or an ester group attached to the ring. Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like OCOOR) and another is something else, maybe a vinyl group?

Wait, but the substituents on the ring could be an ester group and a vinyl group. So, for example, if one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR) and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2CH2 or CH2CH3?), but wait, vinyl is a CH2CH group attached to something. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetyl group (COOR) and another group with a vinyl, like a propenyl group or something.

Wait, but let me think again. The NMR shows two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet (could be a trans coupling) and another is a doublet of quartets (maybe a more complex coupling). Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. Wait, but esters are typically like R-O-CO-R', so maybe substituents are an ester group and another group, perhaps another ester or something else.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl H: maybe the substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2CH2-) attached to the ring, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an allyl group or something more complex.

Wait, going back to the aromatic protons: two signals. So the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of H. Let's think of a benzene ring with two substituents, say, an ester group and another group. If the substituents
