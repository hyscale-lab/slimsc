Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully and think through the steps to solve it.

The compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that molecular formula... Let me try to figure out the possible structure. The formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond or ring (another 1 or 2), and maybe an amine or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me break this down. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet. But this is a triplet, which is a bit confusing. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enol form or an acidic proton like a phenolic OH, but that would be a broad peak, maybe. But wait, the 9.72 is a triplet and probably not OH because OHs are usually broader. Unless it's exchange broadened, but the description says 't' for triplet, so maybe it's an aldehyde.

Then, looking at the aromatic region. 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because when you have two doublets with 2H each, like in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons are split into two doublets. So that's probably two aromatic rings each with substituents.

Then, 6.27 (bs, 2H): broad singlet integrating for 2H. Maybe it's a vinyl group or an enol proton. Or perhaps it's an OH group, but again, the 'bs' suggests broad singlet, which could be due to exchange. Alternatively, it's a set of protons on a conjugated system, maybe adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

The 3.66 (d, 2H) is a doublet integrating for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 connected to something else, like a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene with two substituents, each being a side
