Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, right, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is S_z. The spin states for an electron usually have eigenvalues of ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. So |up> is for +ħ/2 and |down> is for -ħ/2.

But wait, the question is asking about another operator. Oh yeah, the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think. Wait, no, the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix, right? Because it's acting on spin-1/2 particles, so two states. So the matrix would have 0 on the diagonal since A_ij is zero when i=j? Or wait, no, the description says A_ij is ħ/2 if i≠j, else zero. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

Wait, that would make the matrix look like:

[ 0       ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0 ]

Is that correct? So the operator is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal is zero and the off-diagonal is ħ/2 each. Hmm, that's interesting. What kind of operator is this? Well, spin operators are typically in the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our operator here looks similar but scaled by ħ/2. So the operator is (ħ/2) times sigma_x, right? Because sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. So the operator is proportional to sigma_x, which means it's measuring the spin in the x-direction.

But wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>, like (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), if I remember correctly. So the operator in question is S_x, which has matrix elements as given.

But the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So, we need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of S_x. Then, the square of the coefficients would give the probabilities.

Wait, but wait a second. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize it, right? Because it's given as proportional, so we have to find the normalization constant.

Let me write down the state. Let's denote |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 = (1+i) and c2 = (2-i). But first, let me compute the normalization factor.

The normalization is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2. So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2 -i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator in question has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, which are the eigenstates of S_x. Let me write them down.

S_x has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Alternatively, sometimes these are written as superpositions with a phase, but I think that's the general idea.

So, to find the probability of measuring +x or −x, I need to expand |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, then square the coefficients.

Alternatively, since the matrix of the operator is (ħ/2) sigma_x, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value and the probabilities using these states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the state |alpha> in the computational basis (|up>, |down>), then compute the components in the eigenbasis of S_x.

Wait, another approach: the eigenstates of S_x are orthogonal. Let me compute the inner products of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>, then the probabilities would be the squared magnitudes of these inner products.

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is equal to [ < up | + < down | ] / sqrt(2) multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

Let me compute that. So,

< +x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Wait, because < up | up > is 1, < down | down > is 1, and < up | down > is 0.

So it's (1+i + 2 -i) ) / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )

Simplify numerator: 1+i +2 -i = 3.

So < +x | alpha > = 3 / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

< -x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Because |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so when taking inner product, the second term has a negative.

So,

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

Compute numerator: 1 +i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i).

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The magnitude squared is |(-1 + 2i)|² /14 = (1 +4 ) /14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but that sums to 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, but the options don't have 9/14 as an option.
