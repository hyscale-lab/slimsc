Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that high-energy particles can interact with the CMB, which is like the afterglow of the Big Bang. The question is asking about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process, specifically the annihilation into electron-positron pairs.

Wait, the process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. I think this happens when a high-energy gamma photon interacts with a low-energy CMB photon. The gamma has a high energy, and the CMB photon is at about 1e-3 eV. Right, because the average energy of CMB photons is around that.

So, the problem is about the photon's lifetime being limited by this interaction. That must mean that the gamma-ray's lifetime is so short because it's annihilating with CMB photons. So, the calculation probably involves the probability of this interaction and how that affects the mean lifetime.

I remember something about the mean free path and the optical depth. The optical depth τ is the product of the cross-section σ and the number density n of the target photons. When τ is about 1, the process becomes significant. So, the mean lifetime would be inversely proportional to τ. But wait, the lifetime τ is the inverse of the decay rate. So, if the process is significant, the lifetime is limited by this interaction.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation. Let me think. The mean free time τ_free is given by τ_free = 1/(n σ v), where v is the relative velocity. But in particle physics, when dealing with cross-sections, sometimes the lifetime is τ ≈ (n σ v)^(-1) multiplied by the particle's lifetime if it's unstable. Wait, but in this case, the gamma is not a particle with a lifetime like a pion or something. Oh wait no, the gamma is a photon, which is stable, but here the question is about the photon's effective lifetime due to this interaction-induced annihilation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the photon's energy and the reaction threshold. For the reaction γγ → e+ e- to occur, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least the rest mass of the electron-positron pair, which is 2*0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, the CMB photon is much lower energy, so the high-energy gamma photon must have enough energy to meet this threshold when combined with the CMB photon.

Wait, but the CMB photon has an energy of about 1e-3 eV, which is way lower than the MeV scale. So for the reaction to occur, the high-energy photon's energy E must satisfy E + E_cmbr >= m_e c^2 * 2. Since E_cmbr is negligible compared to E for high-energy gammas, but wait, that's only when E is much larger than E_cmbr. But wait, in that case, the threshold is when E * E_cmbr ~ (m_e c^2)^
