Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Hmm, I remember that this is the potential for a harmonic oscillator. Oh right, because Hooke's law is involved here. So this is like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator.

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, each giving an energy and a number of functions.

First, I need to figure out the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz for each direction. But wait, in 3D, the energy levels are usually given in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers plus some constant. 

Wait, no, no, wait. For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Or is that right? Alternatively, I remember that the energy can be expressed as E = ħω (n_r + l + 3/2), but that's perhaps for the radial part. Wait, no, maybe that's for hydrogen-like atoms. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, no, the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator's energy is based on the number of quanta in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is symmetric in all directions. So each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number nx, ny, nz. Each of these can be 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the total energy is E = ħω (nx + ny + nz + 3/2). Because each direction contributes (n + 1/2) ħω, so adding all three gives 3*(1/2) plus the sum of the n's times ħω.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.
