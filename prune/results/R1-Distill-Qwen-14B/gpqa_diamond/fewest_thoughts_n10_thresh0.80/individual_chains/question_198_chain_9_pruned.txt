Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? I remember that in crystal field theory, different geometries and ligands can lead to different colors. Dithiocyanato would probably be the [Co(SCN)_2]^n- complex. But wait, the stability constants are for what? Oh right, each β represents the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for the first complex, say [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^something, etc.

Wait, the stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So for each step, adding one SCN-.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Stability constants are for each step of complexation. So the formation is stepwise. For example, β1 is K for Co^2+ + SCN- ↔ CoSCN^+, β2 is K for CoSCN+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^0, and so on.

Wait, but in the given data, the β values are 9, 40, 63, 16. So β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

But in the solution, the concentration of Co^2+ is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. We need to find what percentage is the dithiocyanato complex, which would be the [Co(SCN)_2]^n- complex, probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 or some charge.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think in some cases, the [Co(SCN)_2]^− may be blue, but I'm not 100% sure. Regardless, the question is about the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_2] species, whatever the charge.

So the approach is to calculate the distribution of Co species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{something}, [Co(SCN)_3]^something, [Co(SCN)_4]^something.

We need to find the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) among all the Co species.

The total Co is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^something + [Co(SCN)_3]^something + [Co(SCN)_4]^something.

But wait, for each complex, the stability constant is the stepwise addition. So for the first complex, β1 is the K for Co^2+ + SCN- → CoSCN+.

Similarly, β2 is the K for CoSCN+ + SCN- → Co(SCN)_2^{2-} (if SCN- is -1 each, then Co^2+ + 2 SCN- → Co(SCN)_2^0? Hmm, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the complex ions.

Wait, Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN- is -1. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 -n+ ), depending on how many SCN- are attached.

Wait, actually, when you add n SCN-, each with -1, the charge of the complex would be 2+ - n*(1-) = 2 - n. So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

So the complexes are:

n=0: Co^2+.

n=1: [CoSCN]^+.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

I think that's right.

But regardless, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4, each being the stepwise formation constant for adding the next SCN-.

So the formation process is as follows:

Co^2+ + SCN- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ → K = β1 = 9.

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → K = β2 =40.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3
