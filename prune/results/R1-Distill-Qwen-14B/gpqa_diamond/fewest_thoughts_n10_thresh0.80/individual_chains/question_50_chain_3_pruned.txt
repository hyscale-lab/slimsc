Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I remember that Feynman diagrams are pictorial representations of the interactions between particles, and each diagram corresponds to a term in the perturbation expansion. Each loop in the diagram corresponds to a loop integral in the calculation.

The question mentions a scribbled note with a certain expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I'm supposed to figure out how many loops the diagram had based on this expression.

Wait, I think the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the perturbation calculation. Each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constant and introduces an integral, which contributes to the overall scaling of the term.

I remember that the general form of a Feynman diagram's contribution involves terms like (coupling constant)^n * (loop integral factors). The loop integral factors usually come with factors of 1/(16 pi^2)^L, where L is the number of loops. Because each loop introduces an integral over four-momentum, which in dimensional regularization gives a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) each time.

Looking at the given expression, the denominator has (4 pi)^6. Let me compute that: (4 pi)^6 is (4^6) * (pi^6) = 4096 pi^6. Hmm, but wait, 16 pi^2 is (4 pi)^2. So each loop contributes a (4 pi)^2 term in the denominator? Or is it 1/(4 pi)^2 per loop?

Wait, wait, I think each loop contributes a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) which is (4 pi)^2 is 16 pi^2, so 1/(4 pi)^2 is 1/(16 pi^2). Oh wait, no: 4 pi squared is (4)^2 pi^2 = 16 pi^2, so 1/(4 pi)^2 is 1/(16 pi^2). So each loop would contribute a 1/(4 pi)^2 factor.

So if the denominator is (4 pi)^6, that's (1/(4 pi)^2)^3, implying three loops. Because 6 is 2 times 3, so three loops.

Let me break down the factors:

The given expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4 pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

So the 1/(4 pi)^6 part is (1/(4 pi)^2)^3. Each loop contributes a 1/(4 pi)^2, so three loops.

But wait, I should also think about the overall scaling with the number of loops. The number of loops affects the power of the coupling constants and the number of integrals. So for each loop, you typically have a factor of the coupling raised to the number of vertices, but that's probably not directly relevant here.

Alternatively, I've heard that the general scaling for a loop integral in four dimensions is something like (Lambda^2)/(16 pi^2)^L, where L is the number of loops and Lambda is some scale. But that might not directly apply here.

Alternatively, when calculating loop integrals, each loop adds a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) (from dimensional regularization), so each loop would bring a 1/(4 pi)^2 factor. So three loops would have (1/(4 pi^2))^3 = 1/(4 pi)^6. Which matches the denominator here.

So looking at the given expression, the denominator has (4 pi)^6, which is (4 pi)^{2L} where L is the number of loops. So 2L=6 â†’ L=3. So the number of loops should be 3.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The numerator has alpha^3 g^2. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4 pi epsilon_0), but in QED calculations, each vertex brings a factor of e. But in terms
