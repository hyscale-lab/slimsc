Okay, so I have this question about nucleophile reactivity, and I need to arrange them from the most reactive to the least reactive in aqueous solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻ or maybe CH2CH2S⁻, not sure)

Wait, wait, I should probably write their structures out or at least visualize them. So, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is the conjugate base of 4-methylcyclohexanol. It's a strong nucleophile because it's an alkoxide ion, right? Alkoxides are good nucleophiles because they're stabilized when they attack, especially in SN2 reactions.

Hydroxide ion (OH⁻) is a strong nucleophile as well. It's a small, negatively charged ion, so it can attack quickly. But wait, sometimes in polar aprotic solvents, it's better, but in aqueous solution, it might not be as strong because it can be stabilized by solvation. Oh wait, but in the given question, all are in aqueous solution, so their reactivity would be considered in that context.

Propionate is CH₂CH₂COO⁻. That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker nucleophile than hydroxide because it's a weaker base. The strength of a nucleophile generally depends on its basicity, but in a polar protic solvent like water, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the better it is. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, in polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity is affected by solvation. So, larger, less charged nucleophiles are better because they're less solvated. For example, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻ in polar protic solvents because F⁻ is highly solvated.

Methanol (CH3OH) is a neutral molecule. It's a poor nucleophile because it's not charged. Neutral molecules can't attack as effectively as their deprotonated counterparts. So methanol will be a weaker nucleophile than any of the anions here.

Ethanethiolate is HS⁻, which is the conjugate base of ethanethiol (HSEt). Thiols are generally weaker bases than alcohols, right? No, wait. Wait, actually, thiols are weaker acids than alcohols. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: pKa of water is about 15.5, while pKa of ethanol is around 19. For thiols, ethanethiol has a pKa around 10. So, it's a stronger acid than water. So the conjugate base (HS⁻) is weaker base than OH⁻. Wait, no, because the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. So if ethanethiol has a lower pKa (more acidic), its conjugate base (HS⁻) is weaker than OH⁻, which has a higher pKa. Wait, no, because if the acid is stronger (lower pKa), the conjugate base is weaker. So ethanethiol is stronger acid than water, so its conjugate base HS⁻ is weaker than OH⁻, which makes sense because OH⁻ is a stronger base.

Wait, so HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. But when it comes to nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent, which one is better? In such solvents, the more polarizable the nucleophile, the better it is. So, HS⁻ is bigger than OH⁻, so it's more polarizable, hence better nucleophile in polar protic solvents. Oh wait, but HS⁻ is a weaker base but a better nucleophile than OH⁻ in polar protic solvents. Because in polar protic, nucleophilicity isn't directly tied to basicity as much as in a polar aprotic solvent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let me think again. In polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity tends to follow basicity because there's less solvation. So stronger bases are better nucleophiles. But in polar protic solvents, the weaker bases are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. So for example, I⁻ is a better nucleophile than F⁻ in polar protic solvents because F⁻ is more stabilized by solvation.

So, in this question, all reactions are in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent. So, which nucleophiles are less solvated and more polarizable?

Let me list all the nucleophiles again:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: a large, bulky alkoxide ion. Its structure is a cyclohexyl group attached to an oxygen with a negative charge. Because it's bulky, it might be less reactive in SN2 reactions, but in terms of basicity, it's a strong base. However, in polar protic solvents, the bulky structure could hinder its nucleophilicity because it's more difficult to approach the electrophilic center.

Wait, but wait. Bulky bases are better in SN1 reactions because they can stabilize the transition state. But in SN2, bulky groups are bad because it's a backside attack; steric hindrance slows the reaction. So for SN2, more compact nucleophiles are better.

But in this question, it's about reactivity in general for substitution reactions. So, maybe the order depends on their basicity and polarizability.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is about which is a stronger nucleophile in an aqueous solution.

Wait, another approach: compare their conjugate acids' pKa values. The weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base, which is a better nucleophile in polar aprotic solvents. But in polar protic, the situation can be different.

So, let's think about the conjugate acids' strengths.

Ethanethiol (HS-Et): pKa ~ 10.

Water: pKa ~ 15.5.

So, the ethanethiolate ion (HS⁻) is a stronger base than hydroxide (OH⁻) because ethanethiol is a stronger acid than water. Wait, no. If the acid is stronger (lower pKa), the conjugate base is weaker. Wait, wait, that's correct. So, since ethanethiol has a lower pKa than water, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻. So, OH⁻ is a stronger base.

In polar protic solvents, the more polarizable a nucleophile is, the better it is. HS⁻ is larger than OH⁻, so it's more polarizable. So in water, HS⁻ might actually be a better nucleophile than OH⁻, despite being a weaker base.

Wait, but I thought in polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity tends to be inversely related to basicity because the strong bases are more solvated. So, for example, F⁻ is a weaker nucleophile than I⁻ in polar protic solvents because F⁻ is a stronger base and more solvated.

So, in that sense, HS⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻, so in a polar protic solvent, HS⁻ would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻. Because the OH⁻ is more solvated (stronger base), so its nucleophilicity is reduced.

Wait, but I've also heard that in protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order is usually I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻. So, the weaker bases (like I⁻) are better nucleophiles.

So, applying this to our nucleophiles:

Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is a weaker base than hydroxide (OH⁻). So in a polar protic solvent, HS⁻ would be a better nucleophile than OH⁻.

Wait, but wait. What about the other nucleophiles?

Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): Its conjugate acid is propionic acid, which has a pKa around
