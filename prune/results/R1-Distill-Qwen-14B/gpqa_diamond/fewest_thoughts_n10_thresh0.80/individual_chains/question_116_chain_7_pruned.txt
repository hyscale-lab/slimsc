Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the number of hydrogens and the splitting can tell us about the structure.

So, a triplet with 6H at 0.9 ppm. That makes me think of either a methyl group next to something. Because in ethyl groups, the CH2 is usually around 1-1.5 ppm. Wait, but a triplet for a methyl? Hmm, maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Like maybe two CH2 groups in a row. Or perhaps a diethyl group?

Wait, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies each H is next to a CH2 with 2 Hs. Let me think: a quartet comes from coupling with a CH2 (since two neighboring Hs would split into a triplet, but wait no, a quartet would come from coupling with a group that has three Hs, but that might not make sense. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me recall: the number of peaks is n+1, where n is the neighboring Hs. So a quartet would come from a CH2 group where each H is next to another CH2 with two Hs. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 next to a CH2CH2, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group. Ethyl groups typically have a triplet for the CH2 next to the CH3. So the triplet at 0.9 ppm is the CH3 of an ethyl group, integrating to 3H each, so two of them would give 6H. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm would be the CH2 next to the CH3, which in an ethyl group is a quartet because each H on the CH2 is next to the CH3's 3H. Wait, no, wait. For an ethyl group, the CH3 is a triplet because each H on the CH3 is next to the CH2's 2H. The CH2 is a quartet because each H is next to the CH3's 3H. Oh wait, no, wait: That's not right. The splitting is based on the neighboring protons. So for the CH2 in an ethyl group: each H on CH2 is next to another CH2, but wait, no, in an ethyl group, the CH2 is adjacent to the CH3. So each CH2 H is next to 3 Hs (from CH3), so that's a quartet for the CH2. And the CH3 would be a triplet because each H is next to
