Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step to figure out the answer.

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The person is trying to understand their developmental fate. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So in this case, the vector has both the ligand and the receptor genes.

The vector setup: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the ligand is first, then the receptor. Each has their own tags. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, sometimes used for expression in various tissues.

Upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA. So, the ligand would be expressed via the CBA promoter, and the receptor via the IRES.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes. Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I think these are stop signals that prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise them. LoxP is recognized by Cre recombinase, which is a site-specific recombinase that cuts and recombines these sites. The lox2272 is a variant that only Cre can cut, right? Or maybe it's a different arrangement. Wait, I remember that loxP and lox2272 are different in that lox2272 has a different sequence and maybe only allows for recombination under certain conditions, like in the presence of a specific Cre variant, or perhaps in a way that allows for directional recombination.

So, the setup is that in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression. When Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, excising the stop cassettes. That would allow the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

The person made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte cultures and ran a Western blot. The total proteins showed a signal proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the blot is working and loading correctly. But what about the fluorescent signals?

They then bred a mouse model that's homozygous for their construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, perhaps. The idea here is that the Cre would excise the stop cassettes in those cells, leading to expression of the ligand and receptor.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They expected to see a green signal, which would come from the eGFP on the receptor. But they didn't. So why didn't the eGFP show up?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. I'm not sure how that would prevent the eGFP from being expressed. Maybe if the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on the same cell, but I'm not sure this directly affects the expression in the Western blot or the fluorescent signal. Also, the construct is designed to express both, so this might not be the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct is properly made, the receptor should be on the cell surface. If it's stuck in the Golgi, then eGFP wouldn't be detected on the surface. But why would Cre cause this? Or perhaps the construct's design has a problem with the signal peptide. Hmm. I'm not sure. The question is about why the EGFP isn't expressed after Cre is active, so maybe this is a possibility.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES, which is a regulatory element. If the construct lacks the necessary enhancers, maybe they're not expressed. But the vector was transfected into cells, which would presumably provide the necessary machinery. Or, perhaps the mouse construct is under a tissue-specific promoter that's not active. Wait, but the CBA promoter is constitutive. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If the stop cassette isn't correctly excised, the receptor might be truncated or not expressed. Oh wait, the stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP. So for the receptor, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassette would prevent eGFP from being expressed. But when Cre is present, it should excise the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. If the receptor and eGFP are in the same frame after excision, then they should be co-expressed. If they're not in frame, then the eGFP might not be correctly expressed, leading to a truncated protein or no eGFP.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. The setup is ligand (with stop) and IRES followed
