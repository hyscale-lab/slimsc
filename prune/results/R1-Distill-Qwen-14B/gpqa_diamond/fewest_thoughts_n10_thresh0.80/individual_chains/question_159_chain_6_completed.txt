Okay, so I need to solve this cosmology problem about the comoving distance of a quasar. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops below that wavelength. Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha forest is a feature in quasar spectra, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is the distance to an object measured in the current universe, considering the expansion. The options are A to D, all in gigaparsecs.

Given the parameters of the universe as per Lambda-CDM model: Hubble constant H0 =70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_total=1).

So the problem is to find the comoving distance at a=1 (which is the scale factor now). Wait, wait, no. Wait, comoving distance is a way to describe distances in an expanding universe. The comoving distance is D_c = a * the proper distance at the time of emission. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the comoving distance from us to a source is given by an integral over the expansion history.

But wait, for a source at high redshift z, the comoving distance is given by (c/H0) multiplied by some integral involving the expansion rate. Oh right, the comoving distance is:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [ dz' / E(z') ]

Where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{3w} ), but wait, dark energy is usually modeled as a cosmological constant, so w=-1, so (1+z)^{3w} is (1+z)^{-3}.

Wait, but when dark energy is a cosmological constant, the equation for E(z) is sqrt( Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda ). Because (1+z)^3*(1) becomes (1+z)^3. Wait, not sure. Let me think: the general expression is E(z) = sqrt( Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^{3(1+w)} ) ), and for a cosmological constant, w=-1, so 3(1+w)=0. So E(z)=sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda ). Oh wait, no, wait. Because the dark energy density scales as (1+z)^{3(1+w)}, and for w=-1, it's (1+z)^0=1. So yes, E(z) = sqrt( Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda ).

So, the integral from 0 to z of dz' / E(z').

But the question is about the comoving distance for a=1 from Earth. Wait, a=1 is now, so the source is at a=1? No, that can't be right. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, when a=1, that's the current time, so the comoving distance would be zero? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. The comoving distance is for objects at a certain scale factor a. So if the quasar is at a=1, that's the same as our current time. So its comoving distance is zero? That can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar when the light was emitted. But no, the question says, "the value of the comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth." Wait, a=1 is now, so the comoving distance is the distance now. So that's the usual comoving distance—so it's the distance in the current universe. So for a quasar at a certain redshift, it's D_c.

Wait, but how does the observed wavelength help? The peak is at 790 nm. I think that's the observed wavelength. Wait, if the peak is at 790 nm, which is near infrared, but I'm not sure what that corresponds to. Maybe it's the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame. So if the observed wavelength is longer, that implies redshift.

Wait, so rest wavelength λ0 is 121.6 nm, observed λ_obs is 790 nm. So the redshift z is (λ_obs/λ0) - 1. Let me compute that: 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.498. So z ≈ 6.498, around 6.5.

Wait, wait, that's a high redshift. So the quasar is at z ≈6.5.

Now, I need to compute the comoving distance D_c for a quasar at z=6.5 given the cosmological parameters.

So the formula for comoving distance is D_c = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [ dz' / E(z') ].

But this integral is tough because it's complicated. So I'll need to approximate it using known values or use an approximation for the integral.

Alternatively, I can remember that for certain redshifts, there are approximate values for D_c.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it properly.

Given H0 =70 km/s/Mpc. Let's convert that into s^-1.

H0 =70 km/s/Mpc =70e3 m/s / (3.086e22 m) ) = 70e3 / 3.086e22 = approx 2.268e-18 s^-1.

But perhaps it's better to compute in terms of H0^{-1}.

H0^{-1} = 1 / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = 1/(70) Mpc s / km. Wait, units can get messy. Alternatively, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. Then, H0^{-1} is 1/(70) Mpc s / (km) * (1e3 m/km) )... Maybe I'm getting stuck on the units here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula in terms of H0 in units of 100 km/s/Mpc, which would make H0 =0.7 in that unit, since 70 =0.7 *100.

Hmm, the standard comoving distance formula for a flat universe (Omega_m + Omega_lambda=1) is:

D_c(z) = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Omega_m*(1 + z')^3 + Omega_lambda)} ] dz'

But integrating this analytically is difficult, so people use approximations or look-up tables or numerical integration.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for D_c at high z.

Wait, at high redshifts, dark energy's effect is less dominant because the matter density is higher in the past. So E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda) ≈ sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3) ) for high z. But wait, no: for high z, (1+z) is large, so Omega_m (1+z)^3 dominates over Omega_lambda. So E(z) ≈ sqrt(Omega_m) (1+z)^{3/2}.

So the integral becomes ∫0^z dz' / [sqrt(Omega_m) (1+z')^{3/2} ] }.

Which is 1/sqrt(Omega_m) ∫0^z dz' (1+z')^{-3/2}.

The integral of (1+z')^{-3/2} dz' is [ 2/(1+z')^{1/2} } ] + C.

Evaluating from 0 to z: 2/(sqrt(1+z)) - 2/(sqrt(1)) )= 2 (1 - 1/(sqrt(1+z)) )

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(Omega_m)) * 2 (1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) )

Therefore, D_c = (c / H0) * (2 / sqrt(Omega_m)) * [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

But wait, this is an approximation valid only when z is large, such that Omega_m (1+z)^3 >> Omega_lambda. For z=6.5, (1+z)=7.5. So (1+z)^3=421.875. So Omega_m*(1+z)^3=0.3 *421.875≈126.56. Omega_lambda is 0.7, so 126.56 >>0.7, so approximation is valid.

So let's compute this.

First, compute (1+z) =7.5, sqrt(1+z)=sqrt(7.5)≈2.7386.

So 1/sqrt(1+z) ≈0.3651.

Compute [1 - 0.3651 ] =0.6349.

Then, (2 / sqrt(Omega_m)) = 2 / sqrt(0.3) ≈ 2 / 0.5477≈3.65.

Multiply by 0.6349: 3.65 * 0.6349≈2.316.

So D_c = (c / H0) * 2.316.

Now, compute c / H0.

c is the speed of light, 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So c / H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = (3e5 /70 ) Mpc.

3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc ≈4.2857 Gpc.

Then, D_c =4.2857 Gpc *2.316≈ (4.2857 * 2.316) Gpc.

Compute 4 *2.316=9.264, 0.2857 *2.316≈0.660. Sum≈9.924 Gpc.

Wait, but that's about 9.9 Gpc. But looking at the options, option C is 9 Gpc.

But wait, is this approximation correct? Hmm, because at z=6.5, the approximation is that E(z) ~ sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3), which is the matter-dominated era.

Wait, but the integral with the approximation gives D_c≈9.9 Gpc. But the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So 9.9 is near 10, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the real value is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate without the approximation.

Alternatively, maybe the redshift isn't that high. Wait, earlier I assumed the peak is the Lyman-alpha line. Wait, let me double-check.

The peak is at 790 nm. The observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. If it's Lyman-alpha, which is 121.6 nm, then that's a redshift of (790/121.6)-1≈6.497. So z≈6.5.

But wait, could the peak be from another emission line? For example, the Balmer series or something else? Maybe H-alpha is around 656 nm in rest frame. Observed at 790 nm would imply a lower redshift. Let's compute.

H-alpha is at 656 nm. Observed at 790 nm: z=(790/656)-1≈(1.204) -1=0.204. So z≈0.2.

Wait, that's a very different scenario. So which is it?

The question says the peak is in the near infrared and optical. Hmm, the near infrared starts around 700 nm or so. So 790 is near infrared. The optical range is up to about 700 or 800 nm. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

If the peak is at 790, and considering it's a quasar, which usually has strong emission lines, but without more context, it's hard to say. But perhaps the Lyman-alpha assumption is correct because 790 is much longer than 121.6 nm, but perhaps the other way around.

Wait, but if the observed wavelength is longer than the rest, that's redshift. So if the rest wavelength is 121.6, observed 790 is longer. So z=(790/121.6)-1≈6.497.

But if the rest wavelength is, say, around 500 nm, then observed 790 would be a lower z. But without knowing the rest wavelength, perhaps the question refers to the Lyman-alpha line.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Lyman break or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the question, the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than that. So perhaps it's the Lyman limit? The Lyman limit is at 91.2 nm. Wait, but 790 is much longer. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman series, but the first line is Lyman alpha at 121.6, then beta at 102.6, gamma at 97.8, etc. So if the peak is at 790, which is much longer than these, that's more likely to be a higher redshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from another line, like the Balmer series. H-alpha is 656 nm rest. So if observed at 790, z≈0.204.

But in that case, the comoving distance would be much smaller.

So this is a problem because the observed wavelength could correspond to different redshifts, depending on the emission line.

Wait, the question states that the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at wavelengths <790 nm. That suggests that there's an absorption feature, perhaps the Lyman alpha forest, which is common in quasar spectra. The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines blueward (shorter wavelength) of the quasar's emission lines, due to intervening hydrogen clouds.

Wait, but in that case, the quasar's own emission lines would be in the near-infrared, suggesting that the Lyman-alpha emission line is redshifted into the near-IR. That would mean a high redshift.

So if the Lyman-alpha line (121.6 nm) is observed at 790 nm, that gives z=(790/121.6)-1≈6.497.

So going back, the comoving distance would be around 9.9 Gpc, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the approximation isn't accurate enough. Let's think about using a better approximation or a calculator for the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up standard values for D_c at z=6.5 in a flat Lambda-CDM model with Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7.

Wait, I remember that at z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.6 billion light-years, which is roughly 0.5 Gpc when using H0=70. Wait, no, wait. 1 Gpc is about 3.26 billion light-years. So z=1 comoving distance is about 1.6 Gpc? Not sure.

Alternatively, using a cosmology calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps an approximate formula exists.

Wait, I remember that for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3, the comoving distance at high z can be approximated as D_c ≈ (c/(H0)) * (2/√(Ω_m)) * (1/(sqrt(1+z)) - 1) )

Wait, no, earlier calculation used that approximation.

Wait, but perhaps the exact integral is better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for D_c in terms of lookback time, but that's more complicated.

Wait, I think I should proceed with the initial approximation, which gave about 9.9 Gpc, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial assumption about the line is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the peak is not the Lyman-alpha line. Let me think: the peak is in near-infrared and optical. The near-infrared is 700-2500 nm, optical is 400-700 nm. So 790 is in near-infrared.

Alternative emission lines:

H-alpha: 656 nm. Observed at 790 would imply z≈0.204.

Balmer series: H-beta is 486 nm, H-gamma 434, H-delta 410, so observed 790 would be a higher z.

For example, H-gamma at 434 nm: z= (790/434) -1 ≈1.819 -1=0.819.

Wait, but the flux drops at shorter than 790 nm, which would imply that the emission line is at 790, and absorption is blueward, but perhaps the peak is in the optical. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the host galaxy's light, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the [O III] emission line, which is at 557 nm. Observed at 790 nm would imply z=(790/557)-1≈1.418 -1=0.418.

So in that case, z≈0.42.

So let's compute D_c for z=0.42.

Again, the formula is D_c = (c / H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z').

E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7)

So for z=0.42, let's approximate the integral.

But doing it exactly would require numerical integration, which I can't do exactly without a calculator. Alternatively, I can use the approximation for when z is not too high, so matter and dark energy both contribute.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for D_c when z is not too high. Let's see...

I think that for z much less than 1, the integral can be approximated as:

∫0^z dz' / E(z') ≈ (2/ (sqrt(Omega_m) (1+z)^(3/2))) ) * [1 - (Omega_lambda)/(Omega_m (1+z)) ) ] )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use a Taylor expansion for E(z) around z=0.

E(z) = sqrt( 0.3*(1 + 3z + 3z^2 + ...) + 0.7 ) = sqrt(1 + 0.9 z + ... )

But this might not be very accurate for z=0.42.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a look-up table or approximate the integral as a series.

Wait, another approach: The comoving distance D_c can be expressed in terms of the lookback time T. But without knowing T, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a universe dominated by matter and dark energy.

Wait, perhaps the D_c at z=0.42 is approximately 2 Gpc.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the age of the universe.

Wait, the age of the universe now is about 13.8 billion years. At z=0.42, the age would be T = 1/(H0) * integral(1/(1+z') E(z') ) dz' ). But that's the lookback time, which is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the comoving distance formula for a flat universe.

Another approach: Using the approximation for D_c(z) in a flat universe.

For a flat universe (Omega_m + Omega_lambda=1), D_c(z) can be approximated using the formula:

D_c(z) = (c / H0) * f(z), where f(z) is a function that depends on Omega_m and z.

For example, for z=0.5, f(z)= (2/ (sqrt(Omega_m)) ) * [1 - (Omega_lambda)/(2*Omega_m) ) ] * (1+z)^{-0.5}.

But I'm not sure about this; perhaps I'm mixing various approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can refer to known values.

Wait, according to cosmology resources, for H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, the comoving distances at certain redshifts are known.

At z=0, D_c=0.

At z=0.1, D_c≈1.2 Gpc.

z=0.5, D_c≈ 2.2 Gpc.

z=1, D_c≈4.2 Gpc.

z=2, D_c≈ 10 Gpc.

z=6.5, D_c≈ about 16 Gpc.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier approximation of 9.9 Gpc.

Wait, perhaps my initial approximation was an underestimate because I neglected dark energy's contribution.

Wait, but in the approximation where E(z) ≈ sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda ), which is what the actual formula is.

So perhaps for z=6.5, the integral is more accurately computed, but I can't do that without a calculator.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options given. The options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. The earlier approximation using the high-z matter-dominated era gave me around 9.9 Gpc, which is close to option C (9 Gpc). But wait, the approximation was that E(z) is dominated by matter, which is correct for high z.

But perhaps the correct answer is 9 Gpc, which is option C.

But the initial calculation using the approximation gave D_c≈9.9 Gpc, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the redshift isn't that high. If the peak is from a lower redshift, like z≈0.5, then D_c would be about 2-4 Gpc, which isn't matching any of the options except A)6, B)8, etc.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to re-examine the question. The question states that there is a peak at 790 nm and flux drops below that. So that might be the Lyman break, which occurs when the ionizing photons are absorbed by hydrogen, making the spectrum drop in the UV and beyond. The Lyman limit is at 91.2 nm. So any light blueward (shorter wavelength) of that is absorbed. But the peak is at 790 nm, which is much longer, so perhaps that's not the Lyman break.

Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's continuum has a peak in the near-infrared, which would suggest it's a very distant object, high redshift.

Wait, quasars often have emission line features, but the overall SED (spectral energy distribution) can peak in the optical or UV, depending on their age and other factors.

If the peak in the observed spectrum is at 790 nm, which is near infrared, perhaps this is due to the quasar's emission being redshifted into that region. That would imply a high redshift, as I thought earlier.

So let's proceed with z≈6.5 and compute D_c.

But because I can't compute the exact integral, perhaps I can find D_c using standard cosmology calculators.

Wait, I remember that for a z of about 6.5, the comoving distance is approximately 16 Gpc, but that's with a lower H0. Because the Hubble constant here is 70, which is higher than the commonly used 70 in some models. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting the scales wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a flat universe:

The comoving distance is given by:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [dz' / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z')^3 + Ω_Λ) ]

But without numerical integration, it's hard to compute.

Wait, perhaps I can look for an approximate formula.

In some textbooks, for a flat universe (Ω_m + ΩΛ =1), the comoving distance can be approximated as:

D_c ≈ (c / H0) * [ (2 / sqrt(Ω_m)) * (1 + (1 - Ω_m/(2(1+z))) )^{-1} ) * ( 1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ) ) ]

But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, another approach: The luminosity distance D_L is related to the comoving distance as D_L = (1+z) * D_c.

But I don't think that helps directly.

Alternatively, I can think about the age of the universe at z=6.5.

The age of the universe is given by T = (1/H0) ∫0^z dz' / ( (1+z') E(z') )

Wait, but that's the lookback time. So the age now is T0, and the age at z=6.5 is T0 - T(z=6.5).

But without knowing T, it's hard to get the distance.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that at z=1, D_c is about 2 Gpc when H0=70.

But at z=6.5, D_c would be much larger.

Wait, but earlier approximation gave me about 9.9 Gpc. But the options don't go beyond 9 Gpc.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the redshift.

Wait, the observed wavelength is 790 nm. What is the rest wavelength?

If the peak is from the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is at 121.6 nm, then z=(790/121.6)-1≈6.497.

But if the peak is from another emission line, like the Balmer series, then z could be lower.

Wait, another possibility: the peak could be due to the Balmer break, which is the wavelength beyond which the Balmer series (emission lines) stops. The Balmer break is at about 364 nm in the rest frame. Observed at 790 nm, z≈ (790/364) -1≈2.17 -1=1.17.

So for z≈1.17.

Compute D_c at z=1.17.

Again, this requires integrating E(z) from 0 to 1.17.

But perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, use look-up tables.

In a standard cosmology model (H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, flat), D_c for z=1 is about 4.2 Gpc.

z=2 is about 9 Gpc.

Wait, wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. If D_c for z=2 is about 9 Gpc, which is option C, then perhaps the answer is D)7 Gpc, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I can find a better way. I'll search my memory for approximate D_c values.

At z=0.5: D_c ~2 Gpc.

z=1: ~4 Gpc.

z=2: ~10 Gpc.

z=6: ~15 Gpc.

But wait, with H0=70, which is a bit higher than the commonly assumed 70 (as in, 70 km/s/Mpc is a typical value), which would make the comoving distance smaller than if H0 were lower.

Wait, wait, higher H0 implies a smaller comoving distance for a given redshift.

Because D_c is proportional to c / H0.

So if H0=70, D_c would be smaller than if H0=60.

Wait, but I'm getting myself more confused. Let's think: if H0 increases, the comoving distance decreases, because the universe is expanding faster.

So for a given z, a higher H0 leads to a smaller D_c.

In our case, H0=70.

If the correct z is about 6.5, then D_c would be ~16 Gpc if H0 were 60. But with H0=70, it's smaller, perhaps ~14 Gpc. But the options don't go that high. So perhaps the initial assumption about the line is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not from an emission line but from the host galaxy's continuum. Then, the redshift might be lower.

Wait, but without knowing the rest wavelength, it's hard to determine.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D)7 Gpc. Because at z=1, D_c is about 4 Gpc, and at z=2, it's about 9 Gpc. So the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc.

The question says that the flux drops below 790 nm. If the peak is at 790, perhaps it's due to a Lyman limit absorption, which would imply a much higher redshift. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the integral numerically.

The integral is from 0 to z of dz' / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

Let me compute this numerically for z=6.5.

But without a calculator, it's hard, but perhaps I can make an approximation.

Let me break the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 6.5.

Compute ∫0^1 dz' / sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7 )

And ∫1^6.5 dz' / sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 +0.7 )

But I'll need to approximate each.

For the first integral (0 to 1):

At z'=0: denominator sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=sqrt(1)=1 → integrand=1.

At z'=1: sqrt(0.3*(8) +0.7 )=sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=~1.761.

So the integrand decreases from 1 to ~0.568.

Assuming roughly linear change, average value ≈ (1 +0.568)/2 =0.784.

So ∫0^1 ≈0.784.

For the second integral (1 to6.5):

At z'=1: denominator ~1.761 → integrand≈0.568.

At z'=6.5: 0.3*(7.5)^3 +0.7=0.3*(421.875)=126.5625 +0.7=127.2625 → sqrt≈11.28 → integrand≈1/11.28≈0.0887.

So the integrand decreases from 0.568 to 0.0887.

Assume roughly exponential or similar decay.

But to approximate, perhaps the average value is (0.568 +0.0887)/2 ≈0.328.

The width of the integral is 5.5 (from 1 to 6.5). So ∫1^6.5≈0.328 *5.5≈1.804.

So total integral ≈0.784 +1.804=2.588.

Multiply by (c/H0)= (3e5 km/s)/(70 km/s/Mpc) )= (3e5/70) Mpc=4285.7 Mpc≈4.2857 Gpc.

So D_c=4.2857 Gpc * 2.588 ≈11.07 Gpc.

Again, this is about 11 Gpc, which is not an option.

But wait, this is a rough approximation, and the actual integral would be more accurate. But perhaps the exact answer is option C)9 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the redshift is lower.

Wait, another angle: the question might be about the luminosity distance, not the comoving distance. But no, the question clearly states comoving distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman-alpha line, but the flux drop is due to something else, like the Lyman limit, which would be at a shorter wavelength. That wouldn't affect the redshift calculation, though.

Hmm. I think I've run out of time to think. Based on the initial approximation where the peak is Lyman-alpha at z≈6.5, the comoving distance comes to about 11 Gpc, but that's not an option. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and the peak isn't Lyman-alpha.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed peak is in the optical, so a lower redshift. Let's say z=0.7.

Compute D_c for z=0.7.

Again, using the same approach.

Compute ∫0^0.7 dz' / E(z').

E(z')=sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7 )

Compute ∫0^0.7 dz' / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 +0.7 )

At z'=0:1/(sqrt(1))=1.

At z'=0.7: sqrt(0.3*(1.7)^3 +0.7).

(1.7)^3=4.913 → 0.3*4.913=1.4739 +0.7=2.1739 → sqrt≈1.474 → 1/1.474≈0.68.

So the integrand goes from 1 to ~0.68.

Assume a linear change, average about 0.84.

Integral ≈0.7 *0.84=0.588.

Multiply by c/H0=4.2857 Gpc → D_c≈4.2857 *0.588 ≈2.52 Gpc. Not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a lower redshift, say z=0.3.

Compute the integral:

From 0 to 0.3.

At z'=0:1.

At z'=0.3: sqrt(0.3*(1.3)^3 +0.7 )=sqrt(0.3*2.197 +0.7)=sqrt(0.6591 +0.7)=sqrt(1.3591)=1.166 → 1/1.166≈0.857.

Average≈(1+0.857)/2=0.9285.

Integral≈0.3 *0.9285≈0.2785.

D_c≈4.2857 *0.2785≈1.19 Gpc. Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the given options are in the 6-9 Gpc range, which corresponds to a redshift around z=1-2.

Wait, for z=2, using the approximation with the integral.

Again, E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(3)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(8.1 +0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=2.966 → integrand at z=2 is 1/2.966≈0.337.

Wait, but the integral from 0 to 2.

But without a better approach, perhaps I should choose the option closest to the initial approximation for z=6.5, which is around 9-10 Gpc. The closest option is C)9 Gpc.

But wait, when I computed with E(z) approximated as matter-dominated, I got ~9.9 Gpc, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is D)7 Gpc, which is closer to the approximate 9 Gpc if I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B)8 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the flux drop below 790 nm. If the peak is at 790, and the flux drops, it could be due to intergalactic medium absorption, like the Gunn-Peterson trough at high redshifts. That would imply a high redshift, so D_c is large.

But again, without knowing the exact z, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 9 Gpc, option C.

Wait, I think I'll have to go with that.


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from the Earth, we analyze the given data and cosmological parameters. The quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical range, with a significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. This suggests the presence of emission or absorption features, potentially indicating a high redshift.

### Key Observations and Assumptions:
1. **Observed Wavelength and Redshift**:  
   The peak at 790 nm could correspond to the Lyman-alpha emission line, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm. If this is the case, the redshift \( z \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 6.497
   \]  
   This indicates a very high redshift (\( z \approx 6.5 \)).

2. **Comoving Distance Formula**:  
   The comoving distance \( D_c \) is given by:  
   \[
   D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')}
   \]  
   where \( E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda} \). For \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \) and \( \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7 \), the integral must be evaluated numerically or approximated.

3. **Approximation for High \( z \)**:  
   At high redshifts (\( z \gg 1 \)), the matter density dominates, and \( E(z) \approx \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3} \). The integral simplifies to:  
   \[
   \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')} \approx \frac{2}{\sqrt{\Omega_m}} \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z}} \right]
   \]  
   Substituting \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \) and \( z = 6.5 \), the integral evaluates to approximately 2.588.

4. **Comoving Distance Calculation**:  
   Using \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), the value of \( c / H_0 \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}}{70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}} \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc}
   \]  
   Thus, the comoving distance is:  
   \[
   D_c = \frac{c}{H_0} \times \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')} \approx 4.2857 \times 2.588 \approx 11.07 \, \text{Gpc}
   \]  
   However, this value is not among the provided options.

5. **Revisiting the Redshift**:  
   If the peak at 790 nm does not correspond to the Lyman-alpha line, it could represent a lower redshift. For example, if the peak corresponds to the Balmer series (e.g., H-\(\alpha\) at 656 nm), the redshift would be:  
   \[
   z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{656} - 1 \approx 0.204
   \]  
   At \( z \approx 0.2 \), the comoving distance would be much smaller, around 1 Gpc, which is also inconsistent with the options.

6. **Matching the Options**:  
   The provided options (6, 7, 8, 9 Gpc) suggest a redshift closer to \( z \approx 1-2 \). For \( z = 2 \), the comoving distance is approximately 9 Gpc, which aligns with option C. This assumes the peak corresponds to a feature with a lower redshift or an approximation of the integral.

### Conclusion:
Given the high redshift implied by the peak at 790 nm and the provided options, the most reasonable assumption is that the comoving distance of the quasar is approximately **9 Gpc**. This corresponds to option C.
