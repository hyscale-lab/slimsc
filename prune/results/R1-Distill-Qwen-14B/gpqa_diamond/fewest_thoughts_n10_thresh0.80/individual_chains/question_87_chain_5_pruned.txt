Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to choose the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the ring is 6-membered, which is typical for benzene. But the compound has 8 carbons in total. Oh, right, because benzene itself is 6 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 more carbons.

Wait, no. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents. So each substituent probably adds some carbons. Let me think. If the benzene ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 8-6=2 carbons. So each substituent would add one carbon each, but maybe one substituent is more complex.

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (like C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are probably a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Because each substituent is on the benzene ring.

So the two substituents could be, for example, a halogen (like Cl or Br) and a ketone group
