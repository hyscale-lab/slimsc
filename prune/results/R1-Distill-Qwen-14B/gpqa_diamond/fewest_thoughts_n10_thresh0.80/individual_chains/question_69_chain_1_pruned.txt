Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when we observe it in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Oh right, the time observed is gamma multiplied by the proper time. So first I need to calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is given by E divided by m c squared. Wait, the energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²). But since both are in GeV and c² is in (GeV)/(mass unit), maybe the units would cancel out? Let me think. E is in energy units, m c² is also energy. So yes, gamma is E/(m c²), but since E is 27 GeV and m c² is 3.41 GeV, gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 times 8 is 27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. Let me compute 27 / 3.41. 3.41 * 7.9 = 27.0? Let's see, 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, 3.41 * 0.9 is about 3.069. So 23.87 + 3.069 = ~26.939, which is close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.9. Maybe a bit more precise, but 7.9 should be good enough for now.

So the observed lifetime tau is gamma multiplied by tau_0. So tau = gamma * tau_0. Let me plug in the numbers: tau = 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that. 8 *7.9 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 s, which is 6.32e-15 seconds. So the lifetime in the lab frame is about 6.32e-15 seconds.

Now, the next part is about the resolution. I think this refers to the resolution of the detector, which needs to be good enough to see the decay products. The question is what minimum resolution (probably in terms of time or distance) is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the number of particles that decay before the detector can register them depends on the time the particles take to travel. So the longer the lifetime (from our perspective), the more particles have time to decay, so higher the detection efficiency. But if the detector's resolution is poor, it can't accurately measure the decay time, so it can't determine if the decay happened within the proper lifetime.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the detection threshold based on the distance the particle travels before decaying. Because in the lab, the particle is moving, so during its lifetime, it travels a certain distance. If the detector's resolution is better than this distance, then it can observe the decay.

Wait, so the distance a particle travels before decaying is called the decay length. The decay length L is c multiplied by the lifetime tau. Because in the lab frame, the
