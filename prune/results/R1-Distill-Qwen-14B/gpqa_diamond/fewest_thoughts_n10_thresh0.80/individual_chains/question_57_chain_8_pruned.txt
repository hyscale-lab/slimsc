Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the given data includes phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄ with values 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. They mention to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we're only considering these five for the calculation.

I remember that in scattering theory, especially for partial waves, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed as a sum over all the angular momentum states, each contributing a term involving the corresponding phase shift. The general formula I recall is something like f(θ) = (1/k²) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l ) P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials, k is the wave number, and the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum value.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That means θ is zero degrees, right? Because the incident beam direction is when the scattering angle θ is 0°. So θ = 0, which affects the Legendre polynomials P_l(cosθ) since cos(0) is 1.

So, I should evaluate each term in the sum at θ=0. Let me think about the Legendre polynomials for various l:

- For l=0: P_0(x) = 1.
- For l=1: P_1(x) = x. So P_1(1) = 1.
- For l=2: P_2(x) = (3x² -1)/2. At x=1, that becomes (3*1 -1)/2 = 1.
- For l=3: P_3(x) = (5x³ - 3x)/2. At x=1, that's (5 -3)/2 = 1.
- For l=4: P_4(x) = (35x⁴ - 30x² + 3)/8. At x=1, it's (35 -30 +3)/8 = 8/8 =1.

Wait, so all P_l(1) are 1? Because for each l, when x=1 (θ=0), the polynomial evaluates to 1. So each term in the sum contributes a factor of (2l+1) * e^{2iδ_l} * sinδ_l * 1. 

But the problem is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to find the imaginary part of f(0). 

Let me write the formula for f(θ=0):

f(0) = (1/k²) * Σ [ (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l ]

Wait, because when you have e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l, that can be rewritten. Let me think about this.

Wait, e^{2iδ}
