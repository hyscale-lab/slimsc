Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacting with a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, I'll break down the problem into smaller parts. I think the key steps are analyzing the NMR to determine the structure of the starting compound, then predicting the reaction pathway.

Starting with the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, the peak at 9.72 is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or a doublet if coupled with something. So maybe this is an aldehyde. But wait, sometimes an aldehyde could be in a different environment, maybe conjugated?

Next, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted aryl groups. Because for a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually split into two doublets in NMR. So, for example, two sets of two protons each.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. That's a bit tricky. Broad singlet suggests some exchange, maybe OH protons? But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, N and O. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation to get some idea of the structure.

Degrees of unsaturation calculation: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2= (10)/2=5. So that's 5 degrees. So, that could be one ring (like benzene, which is 3 DoU?), and maybe some double bonds or other rings. Wait, benzene is 3 DoU (3 double bonds). So 5 DoU could be benzene (3) plus a double bond and a ring, or maybe two double bonds and a ring. Hmm, maybe it's a benzene ring plus an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, like a cinnamaldehyde structure or something similar.

Looking at the NMR again: the triplet at 9.72 could be an aldehyde. But then, the 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H) could be the protons attached to a carbonyl group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Like, an enol or something where there's an OH, but wait, in the molecular formula, O is present. Wait, but the O could be in an alcohol or a carbonyl group.

Wait, the peak at 3.66 ppm is a doublet with 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. Like, maybe a methylene attached to an oxygen. OCH2 is common in structures like ethers or esters, but in this case, maybe it's part of a carbonyl system.

Putting this together: The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm, and the OCH2 at 3.66 ppm. Maybe the structure has a benzaldehyde group connected via an OCH2 group to another aromatic ring.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms in a possible structure. Let's assume the structure
