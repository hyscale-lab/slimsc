Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the problem says the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. But then it also gives the explicit form of the state as a column vector. Oh, right, because they said it's the eigenstate, so we can use that state directly.

The question is about the uncertainty of P_z, ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator in question—in this case, P_z.

So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state. Then plug them into the formula to get the uncertainty.

First, let me write down the state vector. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's denote this as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ].

Wait, but I should confirm if this state is normalized. Let me compute the inner product. The components are squared and summed.

( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, the operator P_z has a matrix given. Let me write that matrix down.

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So it's a diagonal matrix with elements ħ, 0, -ħ.

To find ⟨P_z⟩, I compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Which is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by P_z, then multiplied by ψ.

But wait, the state is real here, right? All the entries are real numbers. So ψ† is just the transpose.

So ψ† is [ -1/2,
