Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about the reaction of a specific compound with hydrogen bromide, and what products form based on the TLC results. Let me think about what I know.

The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Wait, let me draw that structure. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-CH-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So, the butenyl part is four carbons long. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond at position 3. So, numbering from the oxygen, it's 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the structure is OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? No, wait. Let me think again. The butenyl group is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-O- attached to benzene? Wait, no, the substituents.

Wait, the structure is (but-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but here the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So, the structure is:

OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no. Let me try again. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the butenyl chain is four carbons with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, numbering from the oxygen (the first carbon), it's O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)â€” no, wait, wait. Let me sketch it.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that can't be because butenyl is four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but that would be between the third and fourth carbon, which is the same as between C2 and C3 in a four-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I should count from the oxygen
