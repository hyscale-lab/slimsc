Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think this is a two-component spinor. So, it's a column vector, right? Like, the state is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Because when they write (3i,4), it's probably the components of the vector.

The question is about the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, expectation value formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. But wait, S_y is the spin operator. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved. The Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are used to represent spin operators. Specifically, S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where i is x, y, or z.

So, the σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh right, that's correct. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So first, I need to write out S_y. Let me write that down. S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix looks like:
[0, -iħ/2]
[i ħ/2, 0]

Wait, no, the multiplication by (ħ/2) applies to each element. So
