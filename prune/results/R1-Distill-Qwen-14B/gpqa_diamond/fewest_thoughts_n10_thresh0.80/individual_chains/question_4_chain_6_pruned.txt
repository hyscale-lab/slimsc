Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell’s equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. That's why, for instance, when you break a magnet, you just get two smaller magnets, each with their own North and South poles.

Wait, Maxwell’s equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall them. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E equals rho over epsilon zero. That's about the electric field and charge distribution.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero. Oh right, because in our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so there's no magnetic charge. Hence, the divergence of B (the magnetic field) is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. So that's about changing magnetic fields inducing electric currents.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of H equals the current density plus the displacement current. So this connects the magnetic field to moving charges and changing electric fields.

The question is, in a universe where magnetic monopoles exist (isolated North or South poles), how do Maxwell’s equations change? Specifically, which equations are different?

In our universe, the second equation (Gauss's Law for magnetism) says divergence of B is zero because there's no magnetic charge. But if magnetic monopoles exist, there would be a magnetic charge density, let's say rho_m, so the divergence of B would be proportional to rho_m. So equation 2 would change.

Wait, but what about the other equations? Let me think. Faraday's law (equation 3) deals with the curl of E. In our case, it's curl E = -dB/dt. Would that change? I don't think so. Because whether you have monopoles or not, a changing B would still induce an E field. Or wait, if you have monopoles, would there be a different effect? Maybe not. Because Faraday's law is about changing B fields, not about static B fields. Hmm, maybe equation 3 remains the same.

What about Ampère's law (equation 4)? In our case, it's about the curl of H, J, and dD/dt. If there are magnetic monopoles, would that affect this equation? Well, Ampère's law relates the magnetic field to electric currents and displacement. I'm not sure; perhaps it's equation 4 that might not change either? Or maybe it's another equation.

Wait, maybe another approach. Maxwell added the displacement current to Ampère's law to make it consistent with Maxwell's equations and to support electromagnetic waves. But that's about electric fields and currents. Hmm.

So, if magnetic monopoles exist, which equations would change? Equation 2 definitely changes because it's about the divergence of B. But what about others? Let me think about the curl of E.

In our universe, the curl of E is -dB/dt. If there were magnetic monopoles, would that change? No, because the Faraday's law is about how a changing B induces a curl in E. The presence of monopoles might affect other aspects, but not necessarily this equation.

Wait, but wait. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, would there be a magnetic current? Like, a current made up of moving magnetic monopoles. So, perhaps, if you have a magnetic current density, J_m, then maybe the curl of B would involve J_m. Let me think.

The original Ampère's law (equation 4) is curl H = J + dD/dt. But in a universe with magnetic monopoles, perhaps there would be a dual version. So equation 4 might have another term. Or maybe it's equation
