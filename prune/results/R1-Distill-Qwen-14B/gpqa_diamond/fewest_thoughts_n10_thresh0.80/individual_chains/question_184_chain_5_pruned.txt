Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw its structure in my mind. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (C(CH2CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Wait, wait, I should think about the numbering. Oh, wait, in benzene rings, numbering starts at the first substituent and goes clockwise. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Now, the problem is to find the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let me recall the typical reactions used in aromatic substitution.

So, starting with benzene, we'd perform electrophilic substitution reactions to add substituents. The key here is directing effects. Each substituent will direct the next substitution.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects:

- Nitro groups (NO2) are meta-directing.
- Ethoxy groups (OCH2CH3) are ortho/para-directing.
- tert-Butyl groups (t-Bu) are bulky and also para/ortho-directing, but bulky substituents may have steric effects, making para more favorable than ortho.

Wait, but the substituents are being added in some order. The problem is the sequence of adding these substituents.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So, we need to add each of them in a specific order, considering the directing effects.

Let me think about what substituents are added first. Typically, when adding multiple substituents, the first substituent will determine the positions where the next substituents can go. Then, each subsequent substituent will be added in a position relative to the existing substituents.

So, let's consider the possible orders of adding substituents.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, no, because if you add nitro, which is meta-directing, it would affect where the other substituents go. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after other groups. Let me think.

Wait, in this target, the nitro is at position 3. If I have ethoxy at position 1 and t-Bu at position 2, their positions are adjacent. Hmm. Let me imagine the ring.

Positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row.
