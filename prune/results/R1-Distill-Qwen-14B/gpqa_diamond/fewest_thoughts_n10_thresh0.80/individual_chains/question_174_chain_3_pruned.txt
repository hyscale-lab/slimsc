Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity and nuclear physics yet. But let's think through this step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We're supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. Let me break this down. So, the initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

First, I think I should find the rest masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2, where m1 is the more massive one. The problem says m1 is twice as massive as m2, so m1 = 2 * m2.

Also, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 * M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the equation, we get 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait. The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. But when it splits, the total rest mass of the two fragments is 0.99 M, so the mass converted into kinetic energy is 0.01 M. The initial energy is all rest mass; the fragments' rest mass plus kinetic energy equals the initial rest mass plus binding energy? Or wait, maybe this is about the energy released. Hmm, perhaps I should use conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. But wait, actually, if I'm using relativistic equations, maybe it's better to think in terms of four-momentum or energy-momentum conservation. Hmm.

So, the initial total energy is just the rest energy of the nucleus: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has its rest energy plus kinetic energy. So, E1 = m1 c² + K1, and E2 = m2 c² + K2.

Since the nucleus is at rest, the total momentum before is zero, so the total momentum after must be zero. So, the relativistic momenta of the two fragments must be equal and opposite.

The momentum of each fragment is given by p = gamma m v. But since they move in opposite directions, their momenta will cancel out if they are equal in magnitude. So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. But because the direction is opposite, to have the same magnitude, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to consider the relativistic energy and momentum equations.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so each fragment's momentum must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But I'm not so sure about that approach.

Alternatively, let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial momentum is zero, so the sum of the relativistic momenta of the two fragments must be zero. So, p1 = -p2.

So, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, and p2 = gamma2 m2 v
