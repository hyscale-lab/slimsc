Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Hmm, both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different, right? Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if Planet_1's period is shorter, that means it's closer to its star because shorter orbital periods usually mean the planet is nearer. 

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, but same radius, so maybe they're similar in size but Planet_1's star is more massive. I think that affects the habitable zone or something, but I'm not sure how that ties into transit probability.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But I don't think we can know that for sure; that's why there's a probabilistic aspect. Oh, right, the probability also depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, the formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (e^2 + ...)), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that part might not matter. So the probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2. Or is there another factor?

Wait, no, I think that's the area. The probability is actually the ratio of the size of the planet to the size of the star, squared, but also depends on the orbital distance in a way. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Oh wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a_p / R_s), where a_p is the semi-major axis. No, wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (R_s / a_p). Because the probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, passes in front of the star. So the probability is proportional to (R_p / a_p) * (1/R_s) ? Or maybe (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (R_s / a_p), because the area of the star is π R_s², and the area of the planet's disk relative to the star's disk is (R_p/R_s)^2. But the probability is more about the alignment and the size relative to the star's disk.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (R_p / R_s) * (sini), where i is the inclination angle. But since the inclination is random, the average probability is (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by 1/(something). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability for a transit is given by (R_p + R_s) / a_p, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's when a_p is in some units. Maybe it's (R_p / a_p) multiplied by the solid angle or something.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² * (R_s / a_p),
