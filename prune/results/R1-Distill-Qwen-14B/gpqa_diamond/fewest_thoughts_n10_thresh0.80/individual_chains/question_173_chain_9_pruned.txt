Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. 

The problem states that an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2 * 10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are given as different powers of ten in joules.

Hmm, let me recall. The Uncertainty Principle formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but sometimes people approximate this as Δx * Δp ≈ ħ, especially when they're looking for an estimate. So Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. 

Momentum p is mass times velocity, so Δp would be mΔv. But wait, in this problem, I think the speed is given as v=2e8 m/s, but how does that relate to the uncertainty? Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing momentum uncertainty with the momentum itself. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to first find Δp using the uncertainty principle. Then, using that, find ΔE. Because energy is related to momentum through the kinetic energy formula.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Use Δx * Δp ≈ ħ to find Δp. 
2. Then, since ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, which for a non-relativistic particle is the kinetic energy, so KE = p²/(2m). But since we're dealing with an uncertainty, ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m), but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe using the relation between momentum and energy for a particle.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty is directly related to the momentum uncertainty. Because E is related to p via E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E, ΔE, would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). So I need to compute Δp first.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the minimum uncertainty in position and momentum. So let's compute Δp from that.

Given Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1
