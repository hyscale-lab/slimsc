Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Hmm, I remember that substances which decolorize bromine water are usually unsaturated, like alkenes or alkynes. Because bromine adds across double or triple bonds, causing the solution to decolorize.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, a new mixture Y is formed. This Y is the result of a disproportionation reaction. Oh wait, a disproportionation reaction is when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe one of the components in X is undergoing disproportionation.

Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever Y is, it doesn't have the same kind of unsaturation as X. Maybe the double bonds have been broken or converted into something else.

Next, hydrogenation of both X and Y using platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Since Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, it's probably a saturated compound, maybe an alkane.

So the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that means. The formula for mass fraction is (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) = 14.28% = 0.1428.

Let's assume Z is an alkane, since alkanes are saturated and don't react with hydrogen. Let the formula of Z be CnH2n+2. The molar mass would be 12n + 2n + 2 = 14n + 2.

The mass of H is 2n * 1 = 2n g/mol. So, (2n)/(14n + 2) = 0.1428.

Let me solve that equation:

2n = 0.1428 * (14n + 2)
2n = (0.1428 *14n) + (0.1428 *2)
0.1428 *14 is about 2, because 0.1428*14 = 2 (since 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, and 14*(1/7)=2). So 2n = 2n + 0.2856.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.1428 *14 = 2. So 0.1428 *14n = 2n. Then 0.1428 *2 = approximately 0.2856.

So 2n = 2n + 0.2856. That would imply 0=0.2856, which is impossible. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.1428 * (14n +2) as 2n.

So, 0.1428*(14n +2)=2n.

Let me compute 0.1428*14n = 1.9992n (approx 2n), and 0.1428*2=0.2856.

So 2n + 0.2856 ≈ 2n.

Wait, this leads to 2n +0.2856 = 2n → 0.2856=0. Which isn't possible. That suggests an error in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong. Let me re-express the equation:

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%:

(2n) / (12n + 2n + 2) ) = 0.1428

So,

2n = 0.1428 * (14n + 2)

Let me compute this:

2n = (0.1428 *14n) + (0.1428*2)

0.1
