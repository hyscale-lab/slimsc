Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Hmm, wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential. So this is like a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The problem asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be determined by considering the 1D oscillator in each direction (x, y, z). The energy for each direction is given by (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). Since it's 3D and isotropic, the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

So the total energy E is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Wait, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so when you add all three, you get (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes people write the total quantum number as N = n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, excited state meaning the state with the third highest energy, right? But wait, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy. The first excited state is the next one up, then the second, then the third.

Wait, I need to be precise. So, the ground state is N=0 (since n_x, n_y, n_z are all 0). The first excited state would be N=1, the second N=2, and the third excited state would be N=3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The energy levels are E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N is the sum of the quantum numbers. So the ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3.

Wait, but sometimes the states are ordered not by N but by the energy. So, for example, N=0 is the ground state, then N=1 is the first excited, N=2 is second, etc. So third excited is N=3.

So the energy for third excited state N=3 would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the energy part.

Now, the second part of the question is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that same energy eigenvalue. So, for a given N, how many different (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations are there such that n_x + n_y + n_z = N?

In this case, N=3. So the number of possible triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) where each n_i is a non-negative integer and sum to 3. Oh, right, this is a combinatorial problem.

So for N=3, the possible partitions are:

1) 3,0,0
2) 0,3,0
3) 0,0,3
4) 2,1,0
5) 2,0,1
6) 1,2,0
7) 1,0,2
8) 0,2,1
9) 0,1,2
10)1,1,1

Wait, let's count them. For the first three cases, we have each of the three coordinates being 3 and others 0. That's 3 possibilities.

Then, for the next set where one coordinate is 2 and another
