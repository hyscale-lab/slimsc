Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that better. So, the interaction is between the boson field X and some fermion fields. The structure looks like a Yukawa coupling, which typically involves a scalar (boson) interacting with fermions. The mass term for the X boson is given as 6 GeV. The question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Right, so kinematic decay possibilities depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions it can decay into. Since X is a boson, it can decay into pairs of fermions, like fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the first thing I need to figure out is the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. The general rule is that the sum of the masses of the fermions must be less than the mass of the boson for the decay to be possible. Also, the fermions must be charged in such a way that the total charge is conserved, but since X is neutral (assuming because it's a boson coupling to fermions without changing charge), the decay products must be a fermion-antifermion pair.

Looking at the options, all of them list various fermion pairs. But which ones are allowed by the mass of X?

The X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. So any fermion pair whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV can be produced.

Wait, but wait, each fermion comes in pairs, so each pair contributes 2m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion. So the maximum mass of each fermion individually must be less than 3 GeV, because 2m_f < 6 GeV → m_f < 3 GeV.

But wait, no, actually, the sum of the masses of the two particles (fermion and antifermion) must be less than the mass of X. So for a pair like f f̄, the combined mass is 2 m_f. So 2 m_f < M_X → m_f < M_X / 2. So each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than 3 GeV.

So let me list the possible fermions and their masses, approximately.

Electron (e⁻): mass ~0.0005 GeV. Much less than 3 GeV. So e+ e- is possible.

Muon (μ⁻): mass ~0.1 GeV. Also less than 3 GeV. So μ+ μ- possible.

Tau (τ⁻): mass ~1.78 GeV. Well, that's under 3 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Then the quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t).

u quark: mass ~1.5 MeV (<< 3 GeV). So u ū is allowed.

d quark: similar, light, mass around a few MeV. So d d̄ allowed.

s quark: mass about 95 MeV, so s s̄ allowed.

c quark: mass about 1.27 GeV. 2 * 1.27 = 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV. So c c̄ is allowed.

b quark: mass about 4.1-4.7 GeV. Wait, 4.7 GeV is more than 3 GeV. Because M_X is 6 GeV, so 2 m_b would be about 8.2 GeV, which is greater than 6 GeV. So b b̄ is not allowed. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the mass of the X is 6 GeV. Each fermion in the pair would have to be less than 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV must be greater than 2*m_f.

So for b quark: m_b is about 4.5 GeV. 2*m_b is 9 GeV, which is way above X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait the option A says X→b b̄, which would be impossible. So any option including b b̄ as a decay product is incorrect.

So looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b̄. So that's not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option D: also includes b b̄. So D is incorrect.

Option B: No b b̄. So possible.

Option C: Also no b b̄. So possible.

Wait, but what about the top quark? The top is way heavier, like 173 GeV. So even more impossible. So any option with t t̄ is invalid too. So looking at the options:

Option C includes t t̄. So that can't be. So C is incorrect.

So that leaves us with option B and option D. Wait, no, because option D includes b b̄, which we determined isn't allowed.

Wait, let me double-check the options:

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

Option D: same but with b b̄ added. So D is out because of b.

So Option B seems to have all the allowed decay channels except for the ones that are too heavy.

Wait, but wait, let me check the masses again.

Tau is about 1.78 GeV. So 2m_tau = ~3.56 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

c quark is about 1.27 GeV. So 2*1.27 = 2.54 GeV. So that's allowed.

s quark: 95 MeV, so 2*0.095 GeV is 0.19 GeV, allowed.

u and d are much lighter, so allowed.

But what about the muon? Its mass is about 0.1 GeV. So 2*0.1=0.2 GeV, allowed.

The electron is even lighter, so allowed.

So the possible decay channels are: e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all possible.

Option C includes t, which is 173 GeV per quark. So 2*173=346 GeV, way more than 6. So option C is wrong.

So which options are left? Option B and D, but D has b, which is forbidden.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let me check the interaction term again. The interaction is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So assuming f is a fermion, and X is a scalar (boson). So the decay would be X → f f̄.

So the possible fermions f are any that satisfy 2m_f < M_X =6 GeV.

So f can be e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Because:

m_e ≈0.000511 GeV

m_mu ≈0.1057 GeV

m_tau≈1.777 GeV

m_u ≈~1.5 MeV → 0.0015 GeV

m_d ~ few MeV → ~0.002 GeV

m_s ~95 MeV → ~0.095 GeV

m_c ~1.27 GeV

m_b ~4.1–4.7 GeV → no

m_t ~173 GeV → no

So all the fermions except for b and t are allowed.

Thus, the allowed decay products are e+e−, μ+μ−, τ+τ−, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Looking at the options, option B lists all of these except for t t̄. Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So option B is correct.

Wait, but why isn't option D correct? Because D includes b, which is not allowed. So yes, option B is the correct one.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decay products must be fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)), and the total mass of the pair must be less than the mass of \( X \). This means the mass of each fermion must satisfy \( 2m_f < M_X \), or equivalently, \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( e^+ e^- \) is allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( \mu^+ \mu^- \) is allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( \tau^+ \tau^- \) is allowed.
4. **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 0.0015 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( u \bar{u} \) is allowed.
5. **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( d \bar{d} \) is allowed.
6. **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( s \bar{s} \) is allowed.
7. **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( c \bar{c} \) is allowed.
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.1 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( b \bar{b} \) is **not** allowed because \( 2m_b > M_X \).
9. **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( t \bar{t} \) is **not** allowed because \( 2m_t \gg M_X \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which matches **Option B**.
