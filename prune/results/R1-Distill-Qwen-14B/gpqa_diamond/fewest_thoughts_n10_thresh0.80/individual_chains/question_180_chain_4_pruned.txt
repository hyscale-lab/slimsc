Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about an isolated system of particles with charges, and I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Right, okay.

The problem states: There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimal places.

Wait, so all charges are 2e each. So each charge is twice the elementary charge. Since e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, 2e would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

The system is isolated, so energy considerations should be based on the interactions within the system. I'm thinking about the potential energy between charges here. Because in an isolated system, the potential energy is due to the configuration of the charges.

So, what's the setup? 12 charges are at a distance of 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at the center, surrounded by 12 others each 2 meters away.

Wait, but are the 12 charges arranged symmetrically? Since they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps they form a regular structure. Maybe a sphere? But it doesn't specify, so maybe I can assume they're all at the same distance from P, arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, the problem is asking about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps I need to calculate the potential energy considering all the interactions. But wait, in a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them. Since the system is isolated, the minimum energy would correspond to the most stable configuration. Hmm.

Wait, but since all the charges are fixed except for one, wait no, the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are constrained to be at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed relative to P. So their positions are all 2 meters away from P, but their positions relative to each other may vary. But wait, perhaps
