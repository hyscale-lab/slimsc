Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not too sure about that, but maybe it's not super important for solving the problem.

The key info given is about their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and we need to find the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically Planet3's period compared to Planet1's.

The data points are:
- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is ~1.4. So Temp1 / Temp2 = 1.4.
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is ~2.3. So Temp2 / Temp3 = 2.3.
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is ~1.15. So Mass1/Mass2 = 1.15.
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is ~1.35. So Mass2/Mass3 =1.35.
- Albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. The options are A to D, with numbers like ~10.4, ~3.2, etc.

Hmm. So, equilibrium temperature relates to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance from the star. Since the albedo is the same for all, and assuming the star's luminosity is same for all planets (they orbit the same star), then the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(D^2))^(1/4), but with (1-a) as well. Since a is same, it's T proportional to sqrt(sqrt(L/D^2)) ), which is sqrt(sqrt(L))/sqrt(D). But L is same for all, so T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). Or wait, more accurately, T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So the equilibrium temperature depends on L^(1/4) multiplied by (1 - a)^(1/4) divided by D^(1/2). Since L and (1 - a) are the same for all planets, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star.

So if Planet1 has a temperature T1 and Planet2 has T2, then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

Given that T1/T2 = 1.4. So 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides, (1.4)^2 = D2/D1. 1.96 = D2/D1. So D2 is 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Wait, because T2 is higher than T3, so D3 has to be larger than D2. Let's compute that.

Wait wait, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So T2 is higher than T3. That means D3 is larger than D2. So T2 / T3 = sqrt(D3/D2).

So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring, 5.29 = D3/D2. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

We already found D2 is 1.96 D1. So D3 is 5.29 * 1.96 D1. Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96 is approximately 10.37. So D3 ≈10.37 D1, so D3/D1 ≈10.37.

So the distance ratio D3/D1 is about 10.37. But we need to find the orbital period ratio.

Wait, the orbital period is determined by Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P^2 ∝ D^3. So P ∝ D^(3/2).

So the period of Planet3 compared to Planet1 is (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We have D3/D1 ≈10.37. So (10.37)^(3/2) equals what?

Let me compute that. 10.37^(1/2) is sqrt(10.37) ≈3.22. Then 3.22^3 is around 3.22 * 3.22 = 10.368, *3.22 ≈33.39. So approximately 33.4.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the period of Planet3 divided by Planet1. So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) ≈33.4. So the factor is about 33.4. Looking at the options, D is ~33.4.

Wait, but wait a minute. I just used the temperature ratios to find the distances. But the masses are given as well. Oh, but in Kepler's third law, the period depends on the distance and the mass of the star. Oh, but wait, the mass of the planet doesn't come into play in Kepler's third law for the orbital period. That's because the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So Kepler's law is P^2 = (4π²/G(M)) ) * a^3, where M is the mass of the star. So if all three planets are orbiting the same star, then the period depends only on the distance. So
