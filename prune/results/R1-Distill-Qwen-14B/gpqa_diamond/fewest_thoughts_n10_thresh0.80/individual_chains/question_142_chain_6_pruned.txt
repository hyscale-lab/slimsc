Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So, this ρ is a density matrix, but what does it represent?

Let me break it down. The basis states here are |0> and |1>, the standard computational basis for a qubit. So, each of these is a ket vector. When you take their outer products, |0><0| is a matrix that's 1 in the (0,0) position and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Adding them together would give a matrix where the diagonal elements are both 1, and the off-diagonals are zero. Then multiplying by 1/2 brings each diagonal element down to 1/2.

So the matrix ρ would look like:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, that's a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal. I think this represents a completely mixed state. Because a pure state would have a density matrix that's a projection operator, like |ψ><ψ|, which would have rank 1. But this has rank 2 because both diagonal elements are non-zero, so it's a mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that refers to. Oh right, I think it's referring to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is used to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector for a qubit is represented as r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The state is given by (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So for a general state ρ, we can write it in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices.

Let me try expressing ρ in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is:

[ [1, 0],
  [0, 1] ]

And the Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, our ρ is 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|) which is (1/2) I. Because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]] which is I. So ρ is (1/2) I.

Wait, so ρ is (I + 0 σx + 0 σy + 0 σz) * 1/2? Because when you express ρ as (I + x σx + y σy + z σz)/2, the coefficients x, y, z are zero here. So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). Because the r components are x, y, z.

Wait, but wait. The identity matrix is also part of the expression. Because the general expression for ρ is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is (1/2) I, that would imply r·σ is zero, so r is (0,0,0). So the Bloch vector is at the
