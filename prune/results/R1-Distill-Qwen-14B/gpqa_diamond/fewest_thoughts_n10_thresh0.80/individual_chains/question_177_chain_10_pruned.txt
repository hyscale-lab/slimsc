Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Hmm, but the question is about luminosity, right? So mass might not directly affect that, but maybe through other properties.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission (like from blackbody radiation) is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1_max = λ2_max implies T1 = T2. So T is the same for both.

Now, the luminosity of a star, assuming it's a blackbody, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same T, that part cancels out when comparing their luminosities.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, that part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. 

Wait, but the options have options around 2.23 or 2.32. Hmm, why? Because maybe I missed something else. Let me re-read the question.

The question mentions radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s radial velocity, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh wait, wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. But earlier, the problem stated that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift affects the calculation of temperature, which then affects the luminosity calculation. Oh, I didn't think about that.

Because, the peak wavelength as observed is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, the sign matters. If a star is moving away, v_r is positive, and λ_observed is longer (redshifted). If moving towards us (blueshifted), v_r is negative, λ_observed is shorter.

But in this problem, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so its observed wavelength is the rest wavelength. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Wait, but which direction? If it's moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, implying higher temperature
