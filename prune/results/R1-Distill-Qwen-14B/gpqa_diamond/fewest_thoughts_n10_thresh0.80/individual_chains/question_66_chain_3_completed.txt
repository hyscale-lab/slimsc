Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators that could be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, subject to certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. And the choices are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in the context of the SMEFT, I think the operators are required to respect the Poincare symmetry, which would imply they must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So if an operator is Poincare-invariant, it's automatically Lorentz-invariant. So both 1 and 2 being required would make sense.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I remember that in effective field theories, you usually impose the same symmetries as the original theory. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT should as well. So all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So options that include both 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetry? I think that the SMEFT doesn't necessarily require CP symmetry. Because the Standard Model already has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP if they introduce new CP-violating terms. Therefore, operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not necessarily required.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in all Lorentz-invariant theories, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal is a symmetry that comes from the properties of the Lorentz group. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry (which we've determined it must), then it must also respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 must be respected.

Putting it all together: the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. So the correct combination is 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2; that's missing CPT. So the correct answer should be C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators must respect certain symmetries. Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincare symmetry (2) are required because SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model, which already respects these symmetries. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, so both are necessary.

CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily required because the Standard Model already includes CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT operators can introduce additional CP-violating terms. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement.

CPT symmetry (4), however, must be respected because all Lorentz-invariant theories inherently satisfy CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

Thus, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination is 1, 2, and 4, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
