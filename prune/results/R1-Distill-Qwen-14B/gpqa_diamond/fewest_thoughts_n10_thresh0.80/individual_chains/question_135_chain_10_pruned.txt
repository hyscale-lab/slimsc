Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction because it involves a boson coupling to fermions. 

Wait, Yukawa interactions are usually something like λ ψ ψ X, where X is the boson field. So here, the Lagrangian seems to have the fermion fields ψ_f interacting with X. So the interaction term would look like λ f (ψ_f)^2 X, maybe? Because if I expand that, it's -λ f [ψ_f (y)]^2 X(y). Oh wait, the Lagrangian written is -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that again. It's written as -λ f multiplied by ψ_f, then (υ + X(y)) and ψ_f again. So it's -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So that's -λ f (ψ_f)^2 (y) (υ + X(y)).

Wait, no, maybe the correct way to read it is that the interaction is -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). Because the term in the parentheses is (υ + X), but the v is probably a constant, like the vacuum expectation value. So maybe the interaction is proportional to X. So the interaction term is actually -λ f (ψ_f)^2 X(y). So the coupling is λ f X ψψ.

In any case, the main point is that the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term allows for X ψ ψ. So decay channels would be X → f f̄.

Now, the question is about which fermions can X decay into. The options are various combinations of quarks and leptons.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because the sum of their masses must be less than the mass of X (assuming X is at rest, so the invariant mass is X's mass). But wait, actually, the condition is that the rest mass of the fermion pair must be less than X's mass. So each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV because 2m_f < m_X.

But wait, some fermions have masses that are non-zero. Let's list the known fermion masses:

Quarks:
- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV (so negligible, less than 3 GeV)
- Down (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm (c): about 1.3 GeV
- Bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top (t): about 173 GeV (way too heavy)
 
Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~106 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: almost zero (negligible)
 
So for X → f f̄, each f must have mass m_f < m_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So let's see which fermions satisfy m_f < 3 GeV.

Quarks:
- u, d, s, c: all have m_f <3 GeV. But b is 4.5 GeV, which is above 3, so X can't decay into b b̄.

Leptons:
- e, μ, τ. τ is about 1.78 GeV, so less than 3 GeV. So X can decay into e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−.

What about neutrinos? Their masses are negligible, but in the Standard Model, the interaction is via charged currents, but since the Lagrangian involves ψ_f (which includes all components), perhaps neutrinos are involved. But in reality, neutrinos are very light, so X could decay into ν ν̄. But wait, the problem's options don't include neutrinos, so maybe we don't consider them. Or perhaps the problem is only considering charged leptons.

So allowed fermion pairs are:

u, d, s, c (quarks), e, μ, τ (leptons).

Wait, but the top quark is way too heavy, so it's out.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−

Wait, but b's mass is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into bb̄. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

So B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All these have m_f <3 GeV. So this is possible.

Option C: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ−, etc. But t is 173 GeV, way too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. Again, b is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is given. Does this term allow for any specific fermions to decay? Because the Lagrangian includes ψ_f, which would be all the fermion types that are charged under the interaction. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs field interacts with all fermions. But perhaps in this case, the interaction is only with certain fermions. Wait, the question says the interaction is given, so the Lagrangian has f as a parameter. Wait, the Lagrangian is written as lambda f times the other terms. Oh, perhaps f is a flavor index or a type of fermion. So the interaction is with a specific fermion f. So the boson X can only decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

Wait, that would change things. Because if the Lagrangian only couples X to a specific fermion, say, f, then X can only decay into f f̄.

But the problem states, "The interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So maybe X
