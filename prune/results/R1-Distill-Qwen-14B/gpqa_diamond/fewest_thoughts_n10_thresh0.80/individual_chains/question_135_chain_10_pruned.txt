Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given its interaction with fermions and its mass. I remember that in particle physics, the decay products of a particle depend on its mass and the available energy, as well as the possible interactions it can have.

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that better. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)? No, wait, the original expression is a bit confusing. Let me try to rewrite it correctly. It says the interaction term is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't make much sense because the terms in the parentheses would be scalars, so ψ_f is a spinor, so perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's meant to be the Yukawa coupling term, where the boson X interacts with the fermion ψ_f. So the interaction term is something like λ f \bar{ψ} X ψ, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Yukawa term where the field is X, so the interaction is similar to Yukawa coupling where the fermion gets a mass from the Higgs mechanism. But in this case, the term might be the interaction between X and fermions.

Wait, but the structure of the Lagrangian term is important. The given term is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, that seems a bit odd because the term inside the parentheses is a sum of a scalar (ῡ, which I think is the Higgs field) and X(y), which is a bosonic field. So perhaps this term is part of a Yukawa interaction where the fermion ψ_f couples to both the Higgs and the X boson. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, I don't need to focus too much on that. The question is about the possible decay products of the X boson.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs are possible decay products. Remember that the decay of a boson into fermions is allowed if the total mass of the fermion pair is less than the mass of the boson. Also, the fermions must be charged under the interaction. So, for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if their combined mass is less than 6 GeV and whether the interaction term allows for that.

First, let me list the possible fermions. The standard model fermions are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau), as well as their corresponding antiquarks and antileptons.

So, each decay would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion f, the sum of the masses of f and f̄ (which is 2m_f) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Wait, but in reality, when a particle decays, the invariant mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. So for X → f f̄, we must have 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But wait, I should remember the masses of the fermions in the standard model. Let me think about their masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
