Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is to figure out how the presence of spots affects the temperature and, consequently, the ratio of the two energy levels of Ti atoms in the photosphere.

First, some background: in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is proportional to the exponential of the negative difference in energy divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Mathematically, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) )

Wait, but wait. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. But how does that affect the photosphere? Oh, wait, the question says to consider the photosphere when the spots are present. So the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots.

Wait, but the spots are cooler regions, right? So when the spots are present, the average Teff of the star decreases. But what about the temperature of the unspotted regions? Maybe that part is hotter, but the overall effect is a lower average. Wait, but the question says the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere's effective temperature is considered as 55
