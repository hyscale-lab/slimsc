Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. The spins are S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I remember the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, each spin can be either +1 or -1, so each has two possible states. For three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 =8. So, I need to list all 8 possible states and calculate the energy for each.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a smarter way without listing all. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of adjacent spins. So, each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. But wait, since they're multiplied, if two spins are the same, their product is +1, else -1.

Wait, the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute each possible combination.

Alternatively, maybe group the states based on the number of pairs that are aligned. Each pair contributes either +1 or -1, so the sum inside the brackets can take various values.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider all possible states and compute their energies.

So, let's list all possible states:

Each spin can be +1 or -1. So, the states are all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

There are 8 states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, compute the sum inside the energy.

Let's compute for each:

State 1: All +1s.
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum = 1+1+1=3
E = -J *3 = -3J

State 2: S3 is -1, others +1.
S1S2=1
S1S3=-1
S2S3=-1
Sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J

State3: S2=-1, others +1.
S1S2 = -1
S1S3=1
S2S3= -1
Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1
E = J

State4: S2 and S3 are -1, S1=+1.
S1S2=-1
S1S3=-1
S2S3=1 (because -1*-1=1)
Sum = -1 -1 +1 = -1
E= J

Wait, wait, no: S2 and S3 are both -1. So S2S3 is (+1). So sum is (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. So E=J.

Wait, let me double-check. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1 S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1
S1 S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1
S2 S3 = (-1)(
