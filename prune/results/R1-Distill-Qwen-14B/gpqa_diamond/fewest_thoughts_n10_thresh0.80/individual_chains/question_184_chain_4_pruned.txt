Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize the substituents. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, numbering themâ€”benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, wait. Let me think about the numbering. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. That makes them meta to each other where possible, but I might need to check the directing effects.

But wait, when adding substituents to benzene, each new group is added based on the directing effects of the existing substituents. So the order in which I add them will matter a lot.

Looking at the target, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the nitro group is at position 3, the ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So the substituents are all ortho/para directors except for nitro, which is a meta director.

Wait, wait. Benzene rings: when a substituent is attached, its position directs incoming electrophiles to either ortho, meta, or para positions based on its nature. So, for example, activating groups (like -OEt, tert-butyl) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like -NO2) are meta directors.

But the order of adding these substituents matters because each step will influence where the next substituent goes. So I need to plan the synthesis order.

The target has three substituents
