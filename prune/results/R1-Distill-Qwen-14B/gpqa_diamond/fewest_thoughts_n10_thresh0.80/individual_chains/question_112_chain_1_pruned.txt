Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state because the coefficients aren't normalized yet. Let me calculate the normalization factor.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization is found by taking the inner product of the state with itself. Remember that for a state a|up> + b|down>, the inner product is |a|^2 + |b|^2. 

So, |a|^2 is (1+i)(1-i)/1 because the inner product of |up> is 1. Let me compute that: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. So |a|^2 is 2.

Similarly, |b|^2 is (2 - i)(2 + i). So that's 2^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5. Because (2 - i)(2 +i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i² = 4 +1=5. So |b|^2 is 5.

Adding them together, the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next question: we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, but wait, for a 2x2 matrix, that would mean the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So matrix A would look like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally perhaps, but okay, let's proceed.

Wait, but the operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and zero otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that's correct. So the matrix is:

A = [[0, (hbar/2)], [(hbar/2), 0]]

But wait, that's the matrix representation of the operator. Now, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of A. So to find them, I need to solve the eigenvalue problem for A.

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about what this operator represents. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe this operator is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and A is (hbar/2) times that. So A = (hbar/2) * σ_x.

Ah, right! Because σ_x has elements [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. So the eigenstates are the |+x> and |-x> states.

The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)* (+1) and (hbar/2)*(-1), so eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But wait, the question is about the probabilities of measuring the system in each eigenstate of A, so we have to project the state |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A and find the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, the eigenstates form a basis, and the state |alpha> can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenstates. The probabilities are the square of the coefficients' magnitudes.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A. Let me think: because A is (hbar/2) σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's eigenstates.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for +1 eigenvalue and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for -1 eigenvalue. So the eigenstates of A are the same.

Let me denote them as |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities are the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, I can compute the inner products.

So the state |alpha>
