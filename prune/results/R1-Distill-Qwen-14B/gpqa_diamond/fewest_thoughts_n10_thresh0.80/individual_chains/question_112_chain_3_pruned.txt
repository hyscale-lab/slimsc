Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to solve it step by step. Let's see. The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional, so I guess we need to normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized, meaning the sum of the probabilities (squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients) must equal 1.

So the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. Let me compute the magnitude squared of each. 

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so the square is 2. Similarly, for (2 - i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5), so the square is 5. So adding them, the total magnitude squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), right? So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, the elements would be A12=A21= ħ/2, and A11= A22=0. So this operator probably represents something like spin in the x-direction, or maybe another direction. Because the Pauli matrices have similar structures, with 0s on the diagonal and 1s on off-diagonal (except for a factor).

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if this operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by X, then yes. So the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x. Because σ_x has elements [[0,1],[1,0]], so A_ij is (ħ/2) if i≠j, else zero. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, scaled by sqrt(ħ/2), perhaps? Wait, no. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), so ±ħ/2.

But wait, to find the eigenstates, maybe we can find the eigenvectors of this matrix. Alternatively, since A is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? So the eigenstates of operator A are these two states.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to expand |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and find the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the operator A in terms of σ_x. But let me think: since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, then the eigenvectors are the same as σ_x's. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, given that, I can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x> and find the probabilities from the coefficients.

Let me write |alpha> as (a |+x> + b |−x>), then the probability for each eigenstate is |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of the eigenstates.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all divided by sqrt(7). Let me represent |up> and |down> as basis vectors. So |up> = [1; 0], |down> = [0;1]. So |alpha> can be written as a vector:

( (1+i)/
