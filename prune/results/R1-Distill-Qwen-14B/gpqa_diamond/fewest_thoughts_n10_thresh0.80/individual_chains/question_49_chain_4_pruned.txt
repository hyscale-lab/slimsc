Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond within a sigma framework, right? Like Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of that. These reactions are pericyclic, which means they involve concerted movements of electrons, I think.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different starting materials and conditions, and each producing a product. I need to figure out what each product is and match them to the options.

Let me start with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Wait, so the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine? No, wait, the formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's an ethanamine where the amine is on carbon 1, and there are two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So the structure is like OMe-O-C-C-NH2? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two OMe groups on the first carbon. So it's (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? Wait, no, ethanamine is two carbons. So 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (HOCH2)2NMe2? Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like (CH2OCH3)2NH. So the central carbon is connected to two OMe groups and an NH2. So maybe it's (NH2)C(OCH3)2. Wait, but that's three substituents on a carbon. Hmm, okay, perhaps it's a geminal diether with an amine.

The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. So that's CH2CH2CHOHCH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4? No, butenol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double
