Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. So the question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. And I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance. The options are various powers of r, the distance.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So plx is in arcseconds, right? So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it N, is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. Let's see: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So plugging into N: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5, so N ∝ d^5. Oh, but wait, that would mean that the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because as you look further, you'd expect fewer stars in a given volume, but maybe the way it's presented is different.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let's think again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx is small (which is when distance is large), 1/plx^5 becomes large. So N increases as distance increases? So N is proportional to d^5. But that's a bit odd because in reality, the number of stars you can see should increase up to a point and then decrease because you can't see very distant stars as well. But maybe in this problem, it's just a mathematical relationship.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So it's about the change in N as a function of r. So N is proportional to d^5, which would mean that as d increases, N increases rapidly. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but actually, the problem says "the number of stars varies
