Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relationship. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, mathematically, I can write that as N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Parallax is usually denoted as 'plx' sometimes, so N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Got it.

But wait, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if I have a larger distance, the parallax becomes smaller. That means parallax is inversely proportional to distance, like plx ∝ 1/d.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of distance r, and then see how N changes as r changes.

Let me substitute parallax in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/r (assuming r is in parsecs), then 1/plx is r. So substituting into the N equation:

N ∝ (1/plx^5) = (r)^5. Wait, no, wait. Because N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So plx^5 is (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which is r^5.

So N ∝ r^5. Hmm, that seems like a big increase. Wait, but wait, let me make sure I'm doing the substitution correctly.

Another approach: Let me write it out with variables.

Given N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is a constant.

Parallax plx = 1/r, so plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5.

Substituting back into N: N = k * (1/(1/r^5)) ) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh wait, I think that might be about the change in number
