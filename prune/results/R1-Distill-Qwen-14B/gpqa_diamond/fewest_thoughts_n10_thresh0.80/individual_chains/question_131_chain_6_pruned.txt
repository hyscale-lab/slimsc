Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's all about.

Alright, the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that contains a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has an NMR spectrum with a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NOESY spectrum of the major has a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, the initial compound is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid usually forms an anhydride. Since the alkene is cis, maybe the dehydration leads to a cyclic anhydride, like a five-membered ring? Because cyclic anhydrides are more stable.

Now, the anhydride's NMR data: 1H shows a single peak at 7 ppm. What gives a singlet around 7 ppm? Maybe aromatic protons? But wait, the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene, which upon dehydration would form an anhydride. If the anhydride is cyclic, perhaps it's a six-membered ring? Wait, but the H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe it's an aromatic ring or maybe some kind of conjugated system.

Alternatively, think about the 13C NMR: two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. 137 ppm is more in the range of sp2 carbons, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or part of a conjugated system.

Wait, the anhydride structure: an anhydride has two carbonyl groups. So in 13C, two peaks would mean that both carbonyls are equivalent. So maybe the anhydride is symmetrical, perhaps a cyclic anhydride where the two carbonyl groups are in a symmetric position, leading to equivalent carbons.

So, for example, if the starting dicarboxylic acid is something like cis-butenedioic acid (like maleic acid), dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. But wait, maleic acid is a trans-diepoxy... no, wait, maleic acid is cis, right? When dehydrated, it forms maleic anhydride, which has two carb
