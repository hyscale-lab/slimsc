Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I need to think it through carefully. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question says that there's an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, with wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis and falls vertically on this aperture. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can approximate tanθ as θ.

Hmm, okay. So first, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So I think this problem is essentially about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, right! The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk. The minima in the diffraction pattern occur at specific angles, and the first minima are the ones that define the radius of the Airy disk.

The formula for the angular position of the minima in the Airy disk is given by θ = 1.22 * (λ / a), where a is the radius of the aperture. So the first minima occur at θ = 1.22 λ/a, and each subsequent minima is spaced by the same angular distance? Or wait, no. Wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the first minima are the ones at the edges of the central bright spot. But wait, no, for a single slit, the first minima are at θ = λ/a. But for a circular aperture, it's a bit different.

Wait, wait, let me think again. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern's minima occur when the path difference between light waves coming from different parts of the aperture leads to destructive interference. The formula I remember is that the angle θ for the m-th minimum is given by θ_m = (1.22 m) * (λ / a), where m is an integer (m=1,2,3...).

So, the first minima is at m=1, which is θ_1 = 1.22 λ/a. The second minima would be at m=2, θ_2 = 2.44 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be θ_
