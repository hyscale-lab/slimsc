Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectral data. Hmm. Let's see.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me think about the possible functional groups. The molecular formula has 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. So possible groups could be esters, amides, maybe amines, or something with an ether. Let's look at the spectroscopic data.

The IR data shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are typically N-H stretches. The presence of two bands might indicate two different N-H groups, or perhaps one group with different environments. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be an amide, ester, ketone, or maybe a formamide.

Now looking at the 1H NMR:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's likely a CH3 group attached to something that splits it into a triplet. CH3CH2- groups (like ethyl) often show up around 1.2 as triplet because the CH2 next to it has two protons. So maybe an ethyl group.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad singlets are often from -NH groups or possibly from an OCH2 group where the protons are split but appear as a singlet. Wait, but 4.0 ppm is more in the range of an OCH2 group. But wait, an amine would be more downfield. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, an ethylene group with some substituents.

Wait, the next peak is at 4.5 ppm, a quartet (q) with 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with a group that has three equivalent protons, like a CH2 next to a CH3. So that would fit with an ethyl group. So maybe it's an ethyl ester or an ethyl amide.

Then, at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, doublets each integrating to 2H. Those are probably aromatic protons, especially since the doublets suggest coupling with adjacent protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring, where each set of two protons is adjacent. Like two substituents on the ring causing the doublets. Alternatively, perhaps a meta substitution, but more likely para because the splitting is between two sets.

Putting this together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two groups. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be a benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. Wait, but the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. Benzamide would be C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would make it C9H9NO3? Wait, original formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe that doesn't fit. Let me calculate the molecular formula.

Wait, 3-ethoxybenzamide would have C7H5NO2 (benzamide is C7H5NO2) plus ethoxy (OCH2CH3) which would add 2 carbons but also an oxygen, making C9H7NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. So maybe option A is not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. Replacing one NH2 with a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be O=C(N-(4-ethoxyphenyl))NH2? Wait, no, formamide
