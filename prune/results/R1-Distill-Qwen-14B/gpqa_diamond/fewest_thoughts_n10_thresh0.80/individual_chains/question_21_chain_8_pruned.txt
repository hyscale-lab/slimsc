Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. Let's break it down.

The question has two parts, A and B. For part A, I need to figure out which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Tautomerism, if I remember correctly, is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair of electrons between adjacent atoms, resulting in different tautomers. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds or in cases where such shifting is possible, like in enols and ketones.

Benzoquinoneâ€”wait, benzoquinone is a quinone, right? Quinones generally have two ketone groups connected by a conjugated double bond. So, for example, para-benzoquinone would have two ketone groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism often involves moving a hydrogen from one oxygen to another, which is possible in diketones. For example, in 1,2-diketones, you can have enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone, being a 1,4-diketone (if it's para), could potentially have tautomerism. So if it does, then the other compound would be the one that doesn't.

Looking at the other compound, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, it's O=C-(CH2)3-O=C..., or wait, no, positions 1,3,5. So, each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually requires adjacent carbonyl groups or a way for the hydrogen to shift. In this case, the ketones are at every other carbon. So, for example, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO. So, each ketone is separated by a CH2 group. So, for tautomerism, you need two adjacent carbonyl groups, right? Because the hydrogen and the lone pair can shift between them. If they're not adjacent, then the shifting wouldn't be possible. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ketones are alternated, so they aren't adjacent. So, they can't form enol tautomers. That means this compound doesn't show tautomerism. So part A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, wait, but another thought. What if the structure allows for some sort of conjugated shifting? Like, maybe the ring structure allows for some resonance that allows a hydrogen to shift even without being directly adjacent. Hmm. Let me think. The carbonyl groups are every other carbon. So, for example: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO. The ring structure has three carbonyls. So, each is two carbons apart. Do they form conjugated dienes? No, because each is a ketone. Wait, but in a ring, maybe the position allows for some sort of shift. Alternatively, perhaps there's another type of tautomerism, like keto-enol, but that requires adjacent groups. Let me think of examples. In 1,2-diketones, you have adjacent carbonyls, so enol tautomerism is possible. 1,3-diketones can also tautomerize, but maybe less so. Wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that in 1,3-diketones, the enol form can exist because the double bonds can be conjugated. So, for example, 1,3-diketones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones, perhaps in such a way that each pair of adjacent ketones are separated by one carbon. Hmm, wait, no, the positions are 1,3,5. So, each is two carbons apart. So, in a six-membered ring, that's every other carbon.

Wait, so if we have 1,3,5-trione, each ketone is two carbons apart. So, for instance, carbon 1 is a ketone, then carbon 2 is CH2, carbon 3 is a ketone, etc. So, each ketone is separated by a single CH2 group. So, no two ketones are adjacent. Therefore, that would mean that tautomerism isn't possible because you can't have the necessary conjugation for the hydrogen shift. So the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism. So then, part A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So in the options, A is either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-trione.

So, then, looking at the options, for part A, the correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So, in the options, A would be either cyclohexane (options A and C) or benzoquinone (options B and D). So for part A, the correct one is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So for part A, the one without tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Now, moving on to part B. The question is, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image.

First, let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is: CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, or maybe I got that wrong. The formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, propanoate is three carbons. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The carboxylic acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH. As an ester, it's CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, in this molecule, the second carbon (the CH(OH) group) is connected to three different groups: the hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (from the ester, wait no, wait. Let me draw it:

Structure: O

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is:

The acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So, it
