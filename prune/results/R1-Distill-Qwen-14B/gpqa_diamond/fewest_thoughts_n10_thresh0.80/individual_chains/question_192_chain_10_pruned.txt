Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Okay, the question is about a spherical conductor with a cavity. Hmm.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor of radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside, which isn't concentric because the center of the cavity is a distance s from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. 

The question is asking for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when there's a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Oh right, so when we put the +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface would have an induced charge. Oh, but wait, the conductor itself is neutral overall. So the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material is a conductor, so charges move freely.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so any excess charge would reside on the outer surface. Oh, but the conductor was initially neutral, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral overall. The cavity has +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because the charges in the conductor will rearrange so that the +q is attracted. But since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the total conductor's charge is zero. So the inner surface is -q, and the outer is +q.

But wait, the conductor's own material's charges would rearrange. So the inner cavity's charge +q induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer
