Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO, and the NMR data is provided. Then it's reacted with a set of reagents: first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I need to identify the final product from the given options.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows the following peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, I need to figure out what this structure is before any reactions happen. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I did that wrong. Let me recalculate.

The formula is C8H9NO. Let's plug into the degree of unsaturation formula. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2. Assuming no halogens (X=0), so:

DoU = [2*8 + 2 -9 +1]/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a ring and some double bonds or triple bonds.

Looking at the NMR, the peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for one proton. That high up suggests an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's a triplet, maybe it's coupled with two protons. Hmm, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde? Because the aldehyde would be conjugated with a double bond, so the proton could be split by two adjacent protons.

Then, looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets with 2H each suggest two sets of equivalent protons, perhaps in a para pattern. Like maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, the integration adds up to 4H (2+2), so maybe two benzene rings each with two protons? Or one benzene ring with four protons? Oh wait, if it's para-substituted, each ring would have two protons as a doublet.

Wait, looking at the rest of the NMR: 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). A broad singlet for two protons. Broad usually suggests something like an -OH group, but wait, that's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated diene or some kind of enol structure. Or perhaps protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a vinyl group next to an oxygen.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet with 2H. That seems like a CH2 group that's maybe next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe an OCH2 group. Or maybe a CH2 connected to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and possibly an oxygen-containing group like an ether or an ester.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. So 8 carbons in total. Let me try to think of a structure that fits.

If there's an aldehyde group (CHO), then that's one carbon. Maybe some substituents attached via a chain. Let's say the aldehyde is at one end, then perhaps a CH2-O group attached elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps a benzaldehyde derivative. If the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring, but the formula here is C8H9NO. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So the remaining would be C1H3N. Hmm, maybe a substituent with a nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl compound with some substituents. Let me think: another possibility is a structure with a central chain, perhaps with an aldehyde and an ether group.

Alternatively, maybe a structure with a conjugated enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde) attached to two benzene rings. Let me try to think.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm for 1H. For an aldehyde, that's one proton. So maybe that's the aldehyde. Then, the triplet implies coupling with two adjacent protons. So the structure might have an aldehyde adjacent to a double bond.

Like, for example, CH2=CH-CHO. But wait, the aldehyde is at the end. In that case, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet if it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but in CH2=CHCHO, the aldehyde is at the end. The aldehyde proton would not be adjacent to any protons except possibly the double bond protons. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde is part of an enal. For example, CH2=CH-CHO. But in that case, the aldehyde proton is next to a double bond. The coupling would be with the two protons on the double bond. So that would cause a triplet. Oh! That makes sense. So the 9.72 ppm peak is the aldehyde proton, which is coupled to the two protons on the adjacent double bond, giving a triplet.

So the structure might have an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde group.

Now, looking at the aromatic regions: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Each set of two protons as doublets. So if there are two benzene rings, each with a substituent in the para position, perhaps.

Wait,
