Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and when you take their dot product with a unit vector, it's like a combination of them. So σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. But since n is a unit vector, the coefficients n_x, n_y, n_z are such that their squares add up to 1.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices depend on their coefficients. Oh wait, no, each Pauli matrix is traceless and has eigenvalues ±1, right? But when you have a linear combination of them, scaled by some constants, what happens?

I think the idea is that the eigenvalues of a matrix of the form a σ · n is ε times that. So let me see: the Pauli matrices, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have eigenvalues ±1. So if I have σ · n, which is a combination, the eigenvalues would be ±1 multiplied by the magnitude of the coefficients. Wait, but the coefficients here are n_x, n_y, n_z, and since n is a unit vector, the square of each component is less than or equal to 1, and their squares sum to 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be the square root of the sum of squares of the coefficients. Because σ · n is a Hermitian matrix, and its trace is zero. The eigenvalues would be plus and minus the square root of (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²). But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So sqrt(1) is 1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1.

So the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by these. Because H is ε times σ · n. So eigenvalues are ± ε.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues of ±1. The operator σ · n is a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by direction cosines. But when you have a combination of them, the eigenvalues are just ± the magnitude of the vector
