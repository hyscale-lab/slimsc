Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- group or more likely an ester like R-O-CO-R'. Ester groups typically show a strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 in the IR spectrum, which fits with what's given.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break down what each part means.

First, two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would split into different signals based on their positions. For example, in para substitution, there are two types of protons, each as a singlet. But if the substituents are in the ortho or meta positions, the splitting would be different. But the problem mentions two signals, so maybe it's a para substitution, but wait, the substituents might not necessarily be the same. Wait, no, if the substituents are different, the aromatic protons could split more. Hmm, but the question says it's di-substituted, but the substituents could be identical or different.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the aromatic ring has two substituents that cause two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if they are in the para positions, but the substituents affect the ring's symmetry. But I'll get back to that after looking at other parts of the NMR.

Next, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, the ester group has a carbonyl, but perhaps the compound has another double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the benzene are esters.

Wait, the molecule has an ester group. So maybe one substituent is an ester group, and another substituent is something else. Or both substituents are esters? No, probably not since it's di-substituted. Let's think: the ester group would have an oxygen, so maybe it's an aryl ester or an alkoxy ester.

But wait, the 1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl protons usually are on a double bond. So perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that has a double bond. For example, an ester attached to a vinyl group, like a substituted acrylate or something similar.

Wait, another point: the NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups. Two signals, each with their own integration, perhaps. And no signals for CH2 groups. So the structure likely doesn't have any methylene (-CH2-) groups. So substituents probably don't have any two adjacent carbons. So maybe the substituents are something like methyl groups, or maybe part of an ester group.

Let me try to draw this out mentally. So the benzene ring has two substituents. Let's say one is an ester group, like OCOOR, and the other substituent could be something else, perhaps a vinyl group or another group that doesn't have CH2.

Wait, but wait a second. The substituents on the benzene are probably both ester groups or maybe one is an ester and the other is a vinyl group. Let's think about the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that includes a vinyl group attached to the ring. For instance, a substituent like CH2=CHCOO-, which is an ester. But that's a possibility.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group, like part of an ester or another group.

Wait, the ester group itself doesn't have vinyl-H. The ester is R-O-CO-R'. So unless one of the R groups has a double bond, like CH2=CH
