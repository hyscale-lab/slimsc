Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

So the question is about three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here—maybe it's just a way they found the planets. The problem gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find out how much larger the orbital period of Planet3 is compared to Planet1. All have the same albedo, 0.3, like Earth.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Temperature ratios:
  - T1/T2 ≈ 1.4 → So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2.
  - T2/T3 ≈ 2.3 → Planet2 is hotter than Planet3.
- Mass ratios:
  - M1/M2 ≈ 1.15 → Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2.
  - M2/M3 ≈ 1.35 → Planet2 is more massive than Planet3.
- Albedo (a) for all is 0.3.
- Find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So Period3 / Period1 = ?

First, I think about what affects the equilibrium temperature of a planet. The formula for equilibrium temperature, I remember, is based on the balance between incoming stellar radiation and outgoing thermal radiation. The formula is:

T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π² * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature T is given by:

T = T_earth * ( ( L / L_sun ) * ( R_sun / D )^2 )^(1/4 )

Alternatively, T scales with (L/(D²))^(1/4), assuming same star (L is the star's luminosity). But wait, wait—no, each planet orbits a star, but in this problem, since the system is about the exoplanets, maybe all three share the same star. I think the problem implies that, so L is the same for all.

Wait, but the problem doesn't say anything about the star's luminosity or the distance from the star. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the planets are orbiting the same star, so L is the same. So that T is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2). Because T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance D from the star.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4 )

So, T ∝ sqrt( (L (1 - a) ) / D² ) )^(1/2 ), wait, no: Let me think again. Let's simplify the formula.

The formula is T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4 )

We can write this as T ∝ ( L^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - a)^(1/4) ) * ( D^(-1/2) )

But since (1 - a) is the same for all three planets (a=0.3), and L is the same (assuming same star), then T ∝ D^(-1/2). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance D.

So, if Planet1 has a temperature T1 and Planet2 has T2, then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1), because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So, if T1 > T2, D2 must be larger than D1.

Wait, let me make sure: Let's assume D is the orbital distance from the star. So T1 = T_eq1 = [ ... (1/D1²) ]^(1/4 ), T2 = [ ... (1/D2²) ]^(1/4 ). So, T1/T2 = [ (1/D1²) / (1/D2²) ) ]^(1/4 ) = ( D2²/D1² )^(1/4 ) = (D2/D1)^(1/2 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) → which implies D2 = (T1/T2)^2 * D1

Wait, wait: Let me rearrange. T1/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So, square both sides: (T1^2)/(T2^2) = D2/D1 → D2 = D1 * (T1^2)/(T2^2)

So, for Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio T1/T2 is 1.4. So (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = D1 * 1.96 → D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3 → (T2/T3)^2 = 5.29 → D3 = D2 * (T2^2)/(T3^2) → Wait, same as before. So let me calculate.

So for Planet2 and Planet3:

(T2/T3) = sqrt( D3 / D2 )

So (T2/T3)^2 = D3/D2 → D3 = D2 * (T2^2)/(T3^2) = D2 * ( (T2/T3)^2 )

Since T2/T3 = 2.3 → (2.3)^2 = 5.29 → D3 = D2 * 5.29

But D2 is D1 * 1.96. So D3 = 1.96 * 5.29 * D1 → Let me compute that.

1.96 * 5.29 → Let's see: 2 *5.29 is 10.58, but subtract 0.04 *5.29=0.2116, so 10.58 - 0.2116=10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.3684 D1.

Wait, but that's the distance from the star. So D3 is approximately 10.37 times D1.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period. So the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. Remember that Kepler's law says that P² ∝ D³ / M, where M is the mass of the star. But wait, in this case, the planets are orbiting a star, but the mass of the star is much larger than the planets, so M can be considered as the mass of the star, which is the same for all three planets.

So Kepler's third law is P² = (4 π² G^-1 M_star^-1 ) D³. So P² ∝ D³ → P ∝ D^(3/2)

So, the period of Planet3 is P3 = P1 * (D3/D1)^(3/2 )

We have D3/D1 ≈10.37 → (10.37)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37)^3.

What's sqrt(10.37)? Hmm, sqrt(9)=3; sqrt(16)=4. So sqrt(10.37) is about 3.22. Let me calculate 3.22^3.

3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684. Then 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ Let's compute:

10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22 ≈1.185. So total ≈33.385 → approximately 33.4.

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) ≈ 33.4.

Wait, but the options are A) ~10.4, B) ~3.2, C) ~4.4, D) ~33.4. So D is an option. Oh, wait, the question is asking by what factor Planet3's period is larger than Planet1's.

So the answer would be approximately 33.4, which is option D.

But wait, I thought the mass ratios were given. How come the mass ratios aren't affecting this? Because the mass ratios are between the planets. But for Kepler's third law, it's the mass of the star that's important, not the planet masses. So the planet masses are negligible compared to the star, so they don't affect the orbital period. So the given mass ratios (M1/M2=1.15, M2/M3=1.35) might not be needed for this problem. That's a bit confusing. Why were they given?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The question says the planets were discovered through the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, which relies on the gravitational interactions between the planets. So, the presence of each planet affects the others' orbits, causing variations in the timing of their transits. So perhaps the mass of the planets affects the TTV measurements, but in this problem, we're asked about the orbital periods, which are determined by the distance from the star and the star's mass.

So, the mass of the planets themselves wouldn't directly affect their orbital periods. Instead, the orbital periods depend on the star's mass and the distance from the star. So the planet masses given probably aren't needed for calculating the period ratio. They might be a red herring, or perhaps they're used in another part of the problem not mentioned here. But since the question only asks about the periods, I can ignore the mass ratios.

So going back: I think the correct factor is about 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but another thought: Did I miscalculate the D3/D1 ratio? Let me double-check.

So, T1/T2=1.4 → (T1/T2)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = D1 * 1.96.

Then, T2/T3=2.3 → (T2/T3)^2 = 5.29 → D3 = D2 *5.29 = D1 *1.96 *5.29.

So 1.96 *5.29:

Compute 2 *5.29 =10.58. Subtract (0.04 *5.29)=0.2116 → 10.58 - 0.2116 =10.3684.

So D3=10.3684 D1.

Then, P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Calculate sqrt(10.3684): since 3.22^2=10.3684, so sqrt(10.3684)=3.22.

3.22 cubed: 3.22 *3.22=10.3684, then 10.3684 *3.22 = ?

10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22 = approx 1.185 → total ≈33.385, which rounds to approximately 33.4. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer is D) ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant astrophysical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 \approx 2.3 \)
   Using the equilibrium temperature formula, \( T \propto D^{-1/2} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance, we find:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \implies \frac{T_1^2}{T_2^2} = \frac{D_2}{D_1} \implies D_2 = D_1 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2
   \]
   Substituting \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \), we get:
   \[
   D_2 = D_1 \cdot (1.4)^2 = D_1 \cdot 1.96
   \]
   Similarly, for \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \):
   \[
   \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} \implies \frac{T_2^2}{T_3^2} = \frac{D_3}{D_2} \implies D_3 = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{T_3}\right)^2
   \]
   Substituting \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \), we get:
   \[
   D_3 = D_2 \cdot (2.3)^2 = D_2 \cdot 5.29
   \]
   Substituting \( D_2 = D_1 \cdot 1.96 \), we find:
   \[
   D_3 = D_1 \cdot 1.96 \cdot 5.29 = D_1 \cdot 10.3684
   \]

2. **Orbital Period Ratios**:
   Using Kepler's Third Law, \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), the orbital period is proportional to \( D^{3/2} \). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]
   Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.3684 \), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
   \]
   First, compute \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \). Then:
   \[
   (10.3684)^{3/2} = (3.22)^3 \approx 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \cdot 3.22 = 33.4
   \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The mass ratios provided are not relevant to the calculation of orbital periods, as they depend only on the distance from the star and the star's mass.
