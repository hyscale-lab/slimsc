Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the transition of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. So, the atom emits two photons, I guess, because each dipole transition usually corresponds to a photon emission or absorption.

Wait, dipole transitions are governed by selection rules. Right, the selection rules for hydrogen (non-relativistic) are: 
- Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but in practice, usually small changes.
- Δl = ±1. So the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit.
- Δm = 0, ±1. So the magnetic quantum number changes by 0 or ±1.

Wait, so starting from n=3, l=0 (since it's s orbital, l=0), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0.

So the transition has to go via two steps. Because going from n=3 to n=1 in one step would require Δn = -2, but I think dipole transitions only allow Δn = ±1. So you need two steps, like 3→2→1.

So each step is a dipole transition, so each step must obey the selection rules.

First transition: from |3,0,0> to some intermediate state, then to |1,0,0>.

So, for the first step, from n=3, l=0, m=0.

Possible transitions would have Δl = ±1. Since l starts at 0, it can go to l=1. So after first transition, l becomes 1.

So intermediate state must have l=1. So possible states are |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1, m. Then the second transition is from 2,1,m → 1,0,0.

Now, the second transition must also obey selection rules. So from the intermediate state, which is n=2, l=1, m.

We need to go to n=1, l=0, m=0. So Δn is -1 (from 2 to 1), which is allowed. Δl is -1 (from 1 to 0), which is allowed. And Δm is m → 0. So m can change by 0 or ±1.

Wait, for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m>, and the final state is |1,0,0>.

So for the transition, Δm must be 0 - m, but wait Δm can be 0, ±1.

So let's see. If the intermediate state is |2,1, m>, then m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, in the second transition, the m must change from m to 0. So possible m in the intermediate state must be such that m → 0 is allowed via Δm=0, ±1.

So let's check each possibility.

Case 1: Intermediate state
