Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the setup is that Mike has a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to minimize gas molecules because in electron microscopy, those can cause problems by scattering electrons, right? So, even though the vacuum is super good, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment. I remember that the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the pressure and directly proportional to the temperature, among other things. So λ = k*T / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), or something like that—where d is the diameter of the molecules, T is temperature, and P is pressure.

But then when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, but the temperature is the same. So why would λ change if T hasn't?

Wait, the question says the pressure is ultra-low, so the mean free path would be longer. But when the electron beam is on, maybe something else is happening.

Oh, right! When electrons are present, especially in a high-energy beam like 1000 kV, they can interact with the gas molecules. High-energy electrons can cause various effects, like ionization. So the gas molecules might get ionized when the electrons hit them.

If the gas molecules are ionized, their behavior changes. Neutral gas molecules have certain cross-sections for scattering electrons, but ions (charged) would behave differently. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels before colliding. If the gas becomes ionized, the way electrons interact with them changes.

Wait, when a molecule is charged (ionized), does it scatter electrons more or less effectively? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: charged particles would respond more to electric fields, maybe, but in terms of scattering electrons, perhaps they have a different cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization affects the overall pressure indirectly. Wait, but the pressure is already very low. Or maybe the ions are more massive in their movement, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: In the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules might become ionized, which could cause them to stick to the walls of the sample compartment more, or maybe the ions have different behavior. Or perhaps the ionized gas molecules have a different effective diameter for scattering electrons.

Wait, the mean free path is calculated based on the scattering cross-section. If the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, the cross-section for electron scattering might increase. Because an ion has a charge, the electron is more likely to interact with it—so the effective collision cross-section increases.

If the cross-section (σ) increases, the mean free path would decrease. Because mean free path λ = 1/(n σ), where n is the number density. So if σ goes up, λ goes down. So λ2 would be less than λ1. Because when the beam
