Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams moving through glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. And the question is asking what's the speed of the light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, right, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in this case, the speed of light in the glass would be 1/n, since c is given as 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. Oh right, this might involve some relativity. Because the glass is moving, I think the observer's frame will see a different speed. But wait, how does that work when the medium itself is moving?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer. So the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. How do these velocities add up?

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of reference frames. When the medium (glass) is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light in that medium?

I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light in a medium is not simply additive. Oh wait, but wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, regardless of the motion of the
