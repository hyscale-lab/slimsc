Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

The setup is that there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, a mixture of gases is formed. This gas is then passed through three tubes:

1. Tube №1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Its weight increased by 3.60 grams.
2. Tube №2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, and its weight didn't change.
3. Tube №3 has red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80 grams (CuO formed).
4. After these, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what's happening in each step.

First, let me think about the process. Heating salts A and B in an inert atmosphere (without air) likely causes them to decompose. The decomposition products are gases, which are then passed through these tubes.

Tube №1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. I think it reacts with water vapor because Mg(ClO4)2 is used as a desiccant. So if the gas mixture contains water vapor, it will be absorbed here, causing the tube to gain mass. So the increase of 3.60g is likely due to water.

Tube №2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas had CO2, it would react and form CaCO3, but since the weight didn't change, that suggests no CO2 passed through. Alternatively, maybe it's a different gas that didn't react here.

Tube №3: Red-hot copper. If the gas is H2, it would react with CuO to form Cu and water. Or if it's CO, it might not react. But wait, the copper is red-hot. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with a different gas. Let's think: when red-hot copper is exposed to certain gases, like H2 or CO, they can act as reducing agents. So if the gas is H2, it would reduce CuO to Cu, releasing water. But I'm not sure yet.

The remaining gas is 2.24 liters at STP, which is 0°C and 1 atm. 22.4 liters per mole, so 2.24 L is 0.1 mol. But which gas is that? Let's see.

Putting it all together, the gases formed during heating could be a combination of H2O, H2, and perhaps another gas. Let me think about common salt decomposition products. Maybe the salts are metal carbonates or sulfites decomposing into metal oxides, CO2, and SO2 or similar. Alternatively, if the salts are nitrates, they might decompose into NO2, etc. Wait, but since the gas after tube 3 is 2.24 L, which is 0.1 moles, and the gases are passed through, perhaps the initial mixture is a mix of gases that are absorbed in the tubes.

Let me try to deduce the gases.

Tube 1: the gain is 3.60g. Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with water. The formula for this reaction is Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·H2O? Or does it absorb H2O? Wait, no, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent. When it absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, which increases the mass of the tube. So the mass increase is the mass of the water absorbed.

So, 3.60 grams is the mass of H2O. Let's calculate moles of H2O: 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol.

So, the gas mixture has 0.2 moles of H2O. But wait, when you heat some salts, they might produce H2O. For example, heating a carbonate would produce CO2 and H2O: for example, MgCO3 → MgO + CO2 + H2O? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, when a carbonate decomposes, it's usually into the oxide and CO2. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2. But where does H2O come in? Maybe if the salt is a hydroxide, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the salts are bicarbonates, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the salts are sulfites or something else. Wait, maybe the salts are such that when heated, water is released. For example, suppose the salts are sodium bicarbonate (but that's more volatile at lower temps). Wait, but the question says they are heated to 200°C, so maybe something like NH4Cl, but that's more of a solid that decomposes into NH3 and HCl gas at around 170°C.

Wait, but the problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. So, perhaps both A and B are decomposing to release the same gas.

Wait, let me think about the gases. The first tube absorbs H2O, so the gas must have H2O. So when salts A and B decompose, they produce H2O. Then, the next tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas had CO2, the solution would gain mass as CaCO3 precipitates. But in this case, the weight didn't change. So perhaps no CO2 was present. Alternatively, maybe the gas had another component that didn't react with Ca(OH)2.

Then, tube 3 has red-hot copper. Let's think about what gas would react with Cu at high temperatures. H2 could reduce CuO to Cu and form H2O. Alternatively, CO could react, but I'm not sure how. Wait, maybe the gas is a combination of H2 and another gas. But after passing through tube 3, only 0.1 moles of gas C remains.

Wait, another approach: the gas after tube 3 is 2.24 L, which is 0.1 moles. Let me think about possible gases. If it's N2, O2, maybe H2, CO, NH3, etc. Let's see.

Let me consider the decomposition of the salts. Suppose the salts release H2O, H2, and another gas. Let's think about which salts when heated would release H2O and other
