Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about particles being collided in a detector, and some of them reaching the inner walls. The setup says that when particles are collided, they produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, okay. So I'm thinking this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. Because the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. Wait, but the problem is about how many reach the detector walls. So maybe the key is the proper lifetime of the particles and how much time they have to travel before decaying.

Wait, wait. So when particles are produced, they have a certain proper lifetime, which is the lifetime measured in their rest frame. Due to time dilation, the lab frame (the detector's frame) sees their lifetime as gamma times the proper lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the particles are produced at the center of the detector, right? Because the collision is at the center. So the maximum distance a particle has to travel to reach the inner walls is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters.

So the time available for the particle to travel before decaying is important. If the particle's lifetime (as seen in the lab frame) is longer than the time it takes to reach the detector wall, then it will make it. Otherwise, it will decay before reaching.

Wait, so the number of particles that reach the walls depends on how much their lifetime allows them to travel 30 meters before decaying.

So let's model this. The proper lifetime is tau (tau_0). The lab lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

The speed of the particle is v ≈ c (since they are ultra-relativistic). So the time taken to reach the wall is t = distance / speed ≈ (30 m) / c.

Wait, but wait: the time t is the same as the lifetime the particle has. So for the particle to reach the wall, its lifetime must be at least t. That is, gamma * tau_0 >= t.

Or, more precisely, the probability that a particle decays before traveling 30 meters is P = 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau_0)) ). But if the decay is exponential, the fraction that decay before reaching the wall is 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)}.

Wait, but in the problem, it's stated that on average, one third (1/3) reach the walls. Wait no, wait. The problem says that one third reaches the walls. So the fraction that reach is 1/3.

Wait, perhaps the fraction that survive to reach the walls is e^{-t/(gamma tau_
