Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, and their radial velocity (RV) variations can help determine their masses.

The problem says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Oh wait, no, the periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Wait, but in binary systems, the eclipse period is the same as the orbital period, right? Because each orbit, the stars would eclipse each other once if their orbital plane is aligned. Oh wait, but actually, the time between primary eclipses depends on the orbital period and the inclination. But if both are eclipsing, their orbital periods are the same as their eclipse periods. So system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 1 year.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the RV amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10 km/s. So each star's RV is sinusoidal, and the amplitude is the maximum velocity.

I think I remember that the RV amplitude (K) is related to the mass ratio. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v * (M2 / (M1 + M2)) ), where v is the orbital velocity of the system. Or wait, maybe it's something like K
