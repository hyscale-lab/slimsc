Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

Alright, let's start by understanding the setup. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I should write that out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So Ay is c * S. Substituting c, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, but wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are often denoted as σx, σy, σz. The structure of S here looks familiar. Oh, right, S is actually the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Or wait, let me check: the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) σy.

Now, the eigenvalue equation given is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

I know that Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) are Hermitian, which means their eigenvalues are real. But wait, in this case, Ay has a coefficient (h/(4π)), which is a real constant. So Ay is also Hermitian because the product of a real scalar and a Hermitian matrix is still Hermitian. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay should be real.

Wait, but the question is about the statement that will be considered correct during the calculation. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that can't be right because eigenvalues should be real, so the imaginary parts should be zero. So option A probably isn't correct.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real ±1. Again, if the eigenvalues are real, then the imaginary part should be zero. So B doesn't seem right either. Unless I'm missing something here. Hmm, maybe I should compute the actual eigenvalues.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvalues of Ay. Since Ay is (h/(4π)) times σy, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues ±1. So when we multiply by a scalar, the eigenvalues get multiplied by that scalar.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (±1). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. Looking at the options, none of them have imaginary parts zero. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I mixed up the definitions. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 and their eigenvalues are ±1. So S is σy, so eigenvalues are ±1. So Ay = c * S, so eigenvalues are c*(±1) = ±c. So c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, which means any options that suggest imaginary parts are non-zero are incorrect.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). That's impossible because the real parts are correct, but imaginary parts are not zero. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Again, the real parts would be wrong. Because according to our calculation, the real part is ±h/(4π), not ±1.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options directly state this. So maybe I should look elsewhere.

Wait, the question is about the statements considered correct during the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait, A is the angular momentum operator. So for a spin-1/2 particle, the square of the angular momentum operator (A²) would be ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3 * identity matrix, since for spin, A² |ψ> = (s(s+1)ħ²) |ψ>, and s=1/2, so s(s+1) is 3/4. So for spin-1/2, A² has eigenvalue (3/4)ħ². 

But for a spin-1/2 particle, any eigenstate of Ay would also be an eigenstate of A², because A² is a scalar (same for all states
