Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that entropy is a measure of disorder, and for black holes, it's related to their area somehow. Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which says that the entropy S of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon divided by the gravitational constant and the Planck constant. 

The formula, I think, is S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. But maybe I can simplify this in terms of known constants or at least to get the order of magnitude.

The question gives the angular size θ of the event horizon, which is 10^-17 degrees. And the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the radius of the event horizon to compute the area, and thus the entropy.

Wait, the angular size θ is related to the actual size (diameter) of the event horizon. Oh right, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (diameter) / distance. Or more precisely, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance when the size is much smaller than the distance, which is definitely the case here.

So, let's think about the steps:

1. Convert the angular size θ from degrees to radians because most formulas use radians.
2. Find the diameter of the event horizon using θ (in radians) multiplied by the distance d.
3. From the diameter, get the radius (since R = diameter / 2).
4. Calculate the area A of the event horizon, which is 4π R².
5. Plug A into the entropy formula to find S.

Wait, but the distance is given in parsecs. I should convert that into meters because the constants I know are in SI units. Let me remember the conversions.

1 parsec is approximately 3.0857 × 10^16 meters. So, d = 10^10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = around 3.0857e26 meters.

θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 * (π / 180) ≈ roughly 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1 degree = π/180 ≈ 0.0174533 radians. So 1e-17 degrees is 0.0174533e-17 = 1.74533e-19 radians.

Now, using θ ≈ diameter / distance, I can rearrange to find diameter: diameter = θ * distance.

So, diameter = (1.74533e-19 radians) * (3.0857e26 m) = let's calculate that.
