Okay, so I've got this question about stars and how their number changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work it out.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I remember that parallax is related to distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (in some units, like parsecs).

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, how many stars are there in a slice of the sky for a given range of parallax values.

I think about how the volume of space increases with distance. Because the number of stars depends on the volume, right? Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number you see up to a certain distance depends on the volume up to that point.

So, volume in three dimensions. The volume up to distance d is (4/3)πd³. But since parallax is 1/d, that means d = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume would be proportional to (1/plx)^3, which is 1/(plx^3).

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. So if you have a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, the volume of that shell would be the difference in the volumes at those two distances.

The volume at plx is (4/3)π (1/plx)^3. The volume at plx + dplx is (4/3)π (1/(plx + dplx))^3. The difference is approximately (4/3)π [ (1/plx^3) - (1/(plx+ dplx)^3) ) ].

But for small dplx, I can approximate this. Let's think in terms of differentials. The volume of the shell is dV = 4π (1/plx^3) (dplx)/ (plx^2) )? Wait, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, the volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. Since r is 1/plx, dr would be derivative of r with respect to plx. So let me compute that.

r = 1/plx, so dr/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dr = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx. But since we're considering a thin shell, the volume is 4π r² dr. So substituting r = 1/plx, and dr = -dplx/(plx^2), we get dV = 4π (1/plx²) * ( -dplx/(plx²) )) = -4π dplx/(plx^4). The negative sign just indicates direction (since plx increases as distance decreases), but the magnitude is what counts.

So the volume of the shell at a given plx is proportional to dplx / plx^4. Now, since the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume (assuming uniform distribution), the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a small range dplx, dN = (constant) * (dV) = (constant) * (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would match this conclusion.

Alternatively, I should think about it another way. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV, where n is the number density.

The volume element dV at a distance r is 4π r² dr, where r is the distance. Since plx p = 1/r, r = 1/p. So dr = - (1/p²) dp. Therefore, dV = 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp = 4π (-1/p^4) dp. Taking the absolute value, dV = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this shell is n * dV = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. Therefore, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, I've confused flux with distance. But no, this is about number counts, not flux. So I think the 1/p^4 makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{\text{distance}} \). Since stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, the number of stars in a given range of parallax depends on the volume of space corresponding to that range.

The volume of a thin spherical shell at a distance \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) is proportional to \( 4\pi r^2 \, dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes proportional to \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \, \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d\text{plx} \), where \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Simplifying, the volume of the shell is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx} \).

Since the number of stars in a shell is proportional to its volume (assuming uniform distribution), the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This matches option A.
