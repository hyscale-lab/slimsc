Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, if Star_2's radius is R, Star_1's is 1.5R. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, mass. I'm not sure yet how that comes into play here, but maybe it's relevant for something else.

The next part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but the stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosity should depend on their radius and temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann Law comes into play here. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. Where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

Since both stars have the same T, but different R, I can compute the ratio of their luminosities. Let me write down what I know:

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

But since T1 = T2, that simplifies to (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = (R1² / R2²) * (1) because T1 = T2. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, substituting:

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would make Star_1 2.25 times more luminous than Star_2.

Wait, but the options have A) ~2.25, D) ~2.23, and others. Oh, but wait. The question says "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of...", so the factor is 2.25. So the answer would be option A, which is ~2.25.

But wait a second. The problem statement also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Luminosity is an intrinsic property, right? The brightness we observe is flux, which depends on distance and luminosity. But the question says they computed the luminosity, which is an intrinsic property. So I think the radial velocities might not affect the computation of luminosity. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.

Alternatively, maybe the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength, like Doppler shift. Oh! Wait, because Star_2 is moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. But the problem says the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed wavelength is the same, but their intrinsic temperatures are different? No, wait, the question states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So whether it's due to their actual temperature or Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is same.

Wait, but if the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would be shifted. So maybe we have to account for that in determining their actual temperatures.

Wait, let's think again. The peak wavelengths are the same as observed. But the actual temperature is different because of the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, making the observed λ
