Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass that's 1.5 times larger. Interesting, but I'm not sure how mass plays into this right now. Wait, the question is about luminosity, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant here. I'll keep that in mind.

The problem says that through spectroscopy, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law is lambda_max * T = constant, where T is the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures of the two stars must be the same. Because lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So T_1 = T_2. That's an important point.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us much, so no significant Doppler shift affecting its observed wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but earlier it was established that the peak wavelengths are the same. Hmm, does the Doppler shift affect the observed peak wavelength? Because if Star_2 is moving, the observed wavelength would change due to the Doppler effect. But the problem says they found the same wavelengths. So maybe the radial velocity is a red herring, or perhaps it's used for another part. Or perhaps it's about the actual emitted wavelengths, not the observed ones. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

Wait, they used spectroscopy to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. Observation would account for Doppler shift, so perhaps the actual emitted peak wavelengths are different, but because Star_2 is moving, the observed lambda is the same as Star_1. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the rest wavelengths, so the radial velocity affects the emitted temperature, but I'm not sure. Hmm. Let me think about this.

Wait, let me recall the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, its wavelengths would be blueshifted, and moving away would be redshifted. The formula is something like lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the Doppler shift is approximated as delta_lambda / lambda = v_r / c. But in this case, the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, the observed lambda is lambda_1, and Star_2 is observed at lambda_2. But the problem says they are the same, so lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

But Star_1's emitted lambda is lambda1, and Star_2's emitted lambda is lambda2. Because Star_1's radial velocity is zero, lambda1_obs = lambda1. For Star_2, moving at 700 km/s, let's assume it's moving away (since the velocity is positive, perhaps). So lambda2_obs = lambda2 * (1 + v_r/c
