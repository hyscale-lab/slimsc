Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Let me try to think through this.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait—parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, right. Because parallax p = 1/d, where d is distance. So as d increases, p decreases.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. I think that means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a certain volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume. But how does that translate to the parallax?

Parallax is in arcseconds, I think. So if I have a range of parallaxes, say from p to p+dp, I want to find how many stars fall into that range. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume.

Wait, so the number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV, where n is number density (stars per volume). So how does dV relate to parallax?

The volume around a star at a certain distance is a spherical shell. The volume of a shell with radius d and thickness dr is 4πd² dr. But since parallax p is related to d by p = 1/(d * some constant), maybe I should express it in terms of p.

Let me get the relation between parallax and distance correct. Parallax p (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the distance: p = 1/d. So d = 1/p. Also, the volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr.

But I need to express this in terms of p. So let's substitute d = 1/p, so dr in terms of p? Let me see: dr = derivative of d with respect to p. So dr = (-1/p²) dp because d = (1/p), so dr/dp = -1/p². So, dr = (-1/p²) dp. But when p increases, d decreases, so perhaps I should just take the absolute value, so dr = (1/p²) dp. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong, but I'll proceed.

So the volume element at a distance d is 4πd² dr. Substituting d=1/p and dr=(1/p²) dp, that becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Which is 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the volume element is proportional to 1/p^4 dp.

But wait, the number of stars is the number density (n) multiplied by the volume. So the number of stars in a parallax range dp around p is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So the number per unit p (like per parsec of parallax) would be proportional to 1/p^4. Because
