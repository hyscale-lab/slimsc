Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, this relates to the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor tells us that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by this exponential term involving the energy difference and temperature.

So the Boltzmann equation is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is the energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. 

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, and the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2. But wait, are both stars comparing the same energy levels? I think so because the problem states "the same specific energy level" for both.

So, let's denote the ratio for star_1 as (n1)_1/(n2)_1 and for star_2 as (n1)_2/(n2)_2. But wait, no, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think the ratio is (n1)_1/(n2)_1 = 2 * (n1)_2/(n2)_2. Or maybe it's that (n1)_1/(n2)_1 = 2 * (n1)_2/(n2)_2. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, the ratio is (n1)_1 / (n2)_1 = 2 * (n1)_2 / (n2)_2. Wait, no, maybe the excitation is for the same level, so the ratio is n1 (star_1) / n2 (star_2) = 2. Or wait, maybe each star has its own n1 and n2 for the same energy level, and the ratio n1_1/n2_1
