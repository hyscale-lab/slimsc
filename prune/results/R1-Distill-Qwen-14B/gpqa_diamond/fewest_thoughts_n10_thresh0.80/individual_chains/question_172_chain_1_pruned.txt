Alright, I'm going to try to solve this problem. Let me read through it carefully first.

So, the question is about two stars, star_1 and star_2. It says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. And we're supposed to find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative population of two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k*T) )

Here, n_upper is the number of particles in the upper energy level, and n_lower is the same for the lower. g is the statistical weight, which depends on the degeneracy of the level.

In this problem, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think that means the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state?

Wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." So perhaps for star_1, the population in a certain energy level is twice that of the same level in star_2? Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is between star_1 and star_2 for the same energy level. Let me think.

Wait, let's try to model this.

Letâ€™s denote for each star, the population of the energy level. Let's say for star 1, the population is n1, and for star 2, it's n2. The problem states that n1 = 2 * n2. Or perhaps it's the other way around? Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited" as star_2. So more excited means higher energy? Or perhaps it's just the population in the excited state is twice as much.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for a specific energy level, the excitation is twice as high in star_1.

Wait, no, but in terms of population in that energy level. So for a given energy level, say energy level E, the number of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1(E) = 2 * n2(E). Or perhaps it's the other way around? Wait, no. The statement says star_1 is twice as excited. So perhaps star_1 has a higher population in the higher energy levels. So if we're comparing the same energy level, that same level is more populated in star_1.

But wait,
