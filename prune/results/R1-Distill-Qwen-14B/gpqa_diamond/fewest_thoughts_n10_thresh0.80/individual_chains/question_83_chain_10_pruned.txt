Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me take a deep breath and start thinking.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, right, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The problem says we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I need to find the initial concentrations after dilution because the acetic acid is diluted with water. Oh wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? So the concentration after dilution would be half, because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So initial volume is 20 cm³, adding 20 cm³ makes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (20 mL * 0.05 M) / 40 mL = 0.025 M. Yup, that's right.

Next step is the titration. They're adding NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find the pH at this point. And then at the equivalence point, where all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Let me first calculate the moles involved.

The diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M in 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So 0.001 mol of CH3COOH.

At 25% titration, 25% of this has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added: 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH, the reaction produces 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^- (acetate ion).

So, after adding 25% of the required NaOH, the solution will have some unreacted acetic acid and some acet
