Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and going through several steps, and then determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let's parse the initial compound. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornene structure, right? Norbornene has a bicyclic structure with two double bonds. So the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached to position 7. The tert-butoxy is a bulky group, which might influence the reaction later on.

Next, the first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Oh wait, this sounds like an elimination reaction. When dibromomethyl groups are present, and there's a base or something that can abstract a proton, it would eliminate HBr. But wait, the compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group, which is -CH2Br2, right? Or more accurately, each substituent is a -CH2- group where each CH2 has two Br atoms attached? Wait, no, the term "bis(dibromomethyl)" probably means each of the 5 and 6 positions has a CH2 group, each of which is substituted by two Br atoms. So each CH2Br2 is a good leaving group because when two leaving groups are present on adjacent carbons, elimination can occur.

Wait, but when you have two equivalents of this diene, maybe each equivalent can undergo a reaction. Alternatively, perhaps each diene molecule can react twice. Let me think. The starting material is a bicyclic diene with a tert-butoxy group. When reacting with the diene
