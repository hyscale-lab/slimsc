Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully again. Hmm, it's about electric fields and conductors. Alright, let's see.

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, with r being less than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and there's a positive charge +q placed somewhere inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Its distance from the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct formula for E.

Alright, so what do I remember about conductors and electric fields? Oh right, when you have a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. But wait, the conductor here is uncharged. So initially, it has no charge. But when a charge is placed inside the cavity, what happens?

I think that in such a setup, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. Since the conductor is neutral, the charges inside it (if any) would respond. But wait, wait, the conductor itself is uncharged. So the charge +q inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. When you place a charge inside the cavity, it's like having a charge inside a conductor shell. For a conducting shell, the inner surface would develop an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor here is solid with a cavity, so maybe similar principles apply.

So the process: when a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface (the cavity wall) would develop a charge of -q, and the outer surface would have a charge of +q because the conductor was initially neutral. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, it's like the inner surface cancels the +q, and then the outer surface must have +q to balance, since the conductor's net is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the sum of all charges on it must be zero. If the cavity has +q, then the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor was net zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface is -q, so to keep conductor's net charge zero, the outer surface must be +q.

But I'm not sure if the outer surface charge is exactly +q. Wait, perhaps the outer surface charge would be such that the conductor's net charge is zero. But the conductor is neutral, so I think that's right: inner surface -q, outer surface +q.

Now, when we're considering the electric field outside the conductor, like at point P, which is outside, so L > R. Point P is outside, but the conductor's outer surface is at R. So the field outside a conductor depends only on the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which in this case is the charge on the outer surface.

Wait, but the outer surface has charge +q. So the electric field at a point outside the conductor would be as if all the charge were at the center, by Gauss's law.

Wait, no. Wait, Gauss's law for a spherical conductor. The electric field outside a charged spherical conductor is the same as if the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / r², where r is the distance from the center.

In this case, the outer surface has +q, so at any point outside, the field is as if all the +q were at the center.

Wait, but in the problem, the conductor is uncharged. Wait, no, the conductor is uncharged. So the conductor itself has zero charge. So when I put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total conductor's charge zero.

Wait, the conductor's initial charge is zero. So total charge on the conductor is (charge on inner surface) + (charge on outer surface) = 0. So if inner surface is -q, then outer surface must be +q. That way, their sum is zero.

So the outer surface has +q. So Gauss's law outside the conductor would treat the total enclosed charge as +q.

So at point P, which is outside the conductor (L > R), the electric field should be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but wait. What about the position of the charge inside the cavity? Oh, but in the cavity, the charge induces the inner surface, and the outer surface is uniformly distributed because it's a conductor. So the field outside would only depend on the outer charge, which is +q, and the field is as if it's a point charge at the center.

But wait, let's think about the point P's position. The problem says that the distance from the center of the cavity is l, and the distance from the conductor's center is L. The angle between l and s is theta, where s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, perhaps I should draw a diagram. So the conductor's center is O, the cavity's center is O'. The distance between O and O' is s. The point P is a point outside the conductor, at distance L from O, and l from O'. The angle between l and s is theta.

So P is a point outside, so L > R. The electric field at P depends on the charge distribution outside the conductor. So the outer surface has charge +q. So E is as if it's a point charge +q at O, so magnitude is (1/(4πε₀))*(q/L²).

Looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). So that's one possibility.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because the charge inside the cavity is at a certain position, but the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because it's a conductor. So the field outside is only due to the outer charge, which is +q, and it's symmetric, so the field is same as a point charge at center.

So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge will be +q, and the field outside is same as if it's at the center.

Wait, but wait, what if the conductor was a spherical shell? Then yes, the field outside would be as if the charge is at the center. But in this case, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity. But the same logic applies: the charges on the outer surface are uniformly distributed due to the conductor's properties, so the field outside is same as for a point charge at the center.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L^2). So that's what I thought.

But wait, wait another thing. What if the charge inside the cavity is not in the center? If the charge is off-center, does that affect the field outside? Hmm, I think no, because the charges in the conductor's outer surface redistribute to maintain electrostatic shielding. The field inside the conductor is zero, so the outer charge distribution only depends on the total charge of the outer surface, not the position of the inner charge.

So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface will have +q, and the field outside is as if it's at the center. So option B would be correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l^2). But l is the distance from the cavity's center to P. So this would imply that the field is as if the charge were at the cavity's center, but the outer surface's charge is at the conductor's center, so that would be incorrect.

Option A is 1/(4πε₀) * q/(l - s cosθ)^2. Hmm, that looks like the formula for a point charge at the cavity's center, but shifted in some way. But I don't think that's what's happening.

Option C is similar but (l + s cosθ)^2. I'm not sure about that either.

So yes, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, where $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity and a charge of $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. This ensures that the total charge of the conductor remains zero, as it was initially uncharged. The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface, which, in this case, is the charge on the outer surface ($+q$). By Gauss's law, the electric field outside the conductor is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

The distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$ is $L$, so the magnitude of the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option C** suggest a dependence on the distance $l$ and the angle $\theta$, which is not relevant for the electric field outside the conductor, as it depends only on the total charge on the outer surface.
- **Option D** incorrectly uses $l$ (the distance from the cavity's center to $P$) instead of $L$ (the distance from the conductor's center to $P$).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
