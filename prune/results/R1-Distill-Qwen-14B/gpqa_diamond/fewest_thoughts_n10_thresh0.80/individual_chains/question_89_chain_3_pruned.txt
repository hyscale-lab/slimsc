Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. 

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure—like a cage structure. The 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH, especially in such conditions, suggests an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, it's probably a double elimination. So, for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, I think it would form a diene. Wait, but since it's a four-membered ring or something similar, maybe. Alternatively, in the case of vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo), elimination would form an alkene. But here it's 1,3-dibromo, so maybe the elimination isn't possible because they're not adjacent? Wait, no, the structure of adamantane is such that maybe the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent rings, so it's possible. Alternatively, maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Wait, I think in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on carbons that are two apart in the structure. So when KOH is used, it's a dehydrohalogenation, which leads to the formation of a double bond. So the product after KOH would be an adamantene—maybe 1,3-diamantadiene or something like that. But let me think: when you eliminate two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, you would form a double bond. So product 1 would be an adamantane derivative with a double bond, making it more like an adamantadiene.

The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR spectrum shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's probably a methylene (CH2) group with some deshielding. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an epoxide? No, because epoxidation usually involves peracids. Alternatively, it could be a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, the IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That's
