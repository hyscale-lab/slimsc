Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics and magnetic fields. Let's take a deep breath and try to unpack what the problem is asking.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm. I remember that paramagnetism has to do with how materials respond to magnetic fields, and that it's due to the alignment of electron spins. Oh wait, right, in paramagnetism, the magnetic moments are due to individual electrons, not like ferromagnetism which is a bulk effect.

So the setup here is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. Oz is the z-axis, I think. And they mention small m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. So small m would mean that the electron is in a state with a small orbital angular momentum. Maybe that affects the coupling terms somehow.

B is given as 1 Tesla. That's a pretty strong magnetic field, I think. Wait, but in the context of atomic physics, 1 T isn't that enormous. Earth's magnetic field is about 0.5 Gauss, which is 0.0005 Tesla, so 1 T is a thousand times stronger. Oh but still, I guess for some effects, it's significant.

The problem asks to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman effect term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, that's the Balmer series, right? The Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm, which is 0.656 micrometers. Wait, no, 0.4861 micrometers is blue, so that must be the transition from n=4 to n=2 in hydrogen. Let me check: the Balmer series is transitions ending at n=2, so the wavelengths are given by 1/λ = R*(1/(n²) - 1/4), where R is the Rydberg constant. For n=3, λ ≈ 656 nm (red), n=4 gives λ≈486 nm (blue), so this must be that transition.

The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=4 and n=2, ΔE would be E_2 - E_4. Let me calculate that.

E_2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV
E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV
ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. Wait, but energy differences are positive, so 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman effect term. The Zeeman effect arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number, but in this problem, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up here. Or perhaps the problem is considering the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment, so m is the orbital m, not the spin m_s.

Wait, no, the paramagnetic effect in atoms arises from the spin, but in some cases, like if the orbital contribution is considered, maybe it's the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term in the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment for orbital angular momentum is μ_orbital = (e/(2m)) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So the coupling term would be proportional to m times B, because L_z = mħ, so μ_z = (e/(2m)) * mħ (something like that). Wait, maybe more accurately, μ = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton (μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e c) ), and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number.

So the energy due to the Zeeman effect would be E_Zeeman = μ·B = μ_B * m * B.

But wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term", which usually refers to the spin term. Oh wait, but paramagnetism comes from the spin, right? Because orbital contributions are part of diamagnetism. Or wait, no, orbital contributions are part of the paramagnetic effect as well. I might be getting confused. Let me think.

In the Zeeman effect, the total magnetic moment is the sum of the orbital and spin contributions. For a free electron, the magnetic moment is (g_s μ_B) S + (μ_B) L, where g_s is the Landé g-factor for spin, which is roughly 2. But when you have an atom, the orbital contribution comes into play. So the paramagnetic effect in atoms is due to both spin and orbital contributions. But in this problem, perhaps they're only considering the orbital contribution. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term". Oh, paramagnetism is due to unpaired electrons, mainly their spin. So maybe the paramagnetic term is the spin term. So perhaps the coupling term is the spin Zeeman term.

So H_paramagnetic = -μ_spin · B.

μ_spin = -g_s μ_B S_z.

In terms of quantum numbers, S_z = ħ m_s, and m_s can be ±1/2. So the spin term would be proportional to m_s.

Wait, but the problem states "small values of m". Wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which in this context is maybe being considered. Hmm, perhaps the problem is about the orbital contribution to the paramagnetic effect. Or maybe I'm mixing up m and m_s.

Wait, the problem says "small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)". So perhaps m is small, like m=0,1, etc. So the orbital magnetic quantum number is small, which I think relates to the s or p orbitals, which have small l values (s: l=0, p: l=1). So for electrons in s or p orbitals, the orbital contribution is small.

But the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term. I think I need to figure out what the typical magnitude of that term is compared to the transition energy.

So let's compute both terms.

First, the transition energy ΔE is 2.55 eV, as I calculated earlier.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman energy shift. Let's calculate it.

The paramagnetic coupling term for the spin is H_spin = -μ_spin · B.

μ_spin = g_s μ_B m_s.

Since electrons have spin-½, m_s = ±1/2.

So H_spin = -g_s μ_B m_s B.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T.

g_s for an electron is about 2. So plugging in the numbers:

H_spin = -2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * (1/2) * 1 T

Wait, because m_s is 1/2 (for an electron), so let's see:

H_spin = - (2) * (9.274e-24 J/T) * (1/2) * B.

Since B is 1 T,

H_spin = - (2 * 9.274e-24 * 0.5 ) * 1

Simplify:

2 * 0.5 = 1, so H_spin = -9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but that's the energy in joules. Let me convert it to eV to compare with ΔE.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So H_spin = -9.274e-24 J / 1.60
