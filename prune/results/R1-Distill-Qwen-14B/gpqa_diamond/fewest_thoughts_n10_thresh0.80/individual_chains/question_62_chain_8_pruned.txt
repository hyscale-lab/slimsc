Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using the correct sequence of reagents. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me draw its structure in my mind. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a CH(OH) group attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Oh, right, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH group that also has an hydroxy group. So, the structure is like this: a cyclohexane ring attached to another cyclohexane (so cyclohexyl group) via a CH(OH) group. And on the same carbon where the CH(OH) is attached, there's a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). Wait, no, wait. The carbaldehyde is on the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part. So the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the substituent is the (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group at position 1.

Wait, so the main structure is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, on the same carbon (position 1), there's a CH group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group.

So, the structure is like cyclohexane with a CHO on C1, and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group also on C1. So, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde ring.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is the acetylene group. So, the starting material is cyclohexane with an ethynyl substituent.

So, I need to find the reagents that can transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target compound.

Let me think
