Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? 

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions.

Wait, so both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are forms of phosphate. Let me think about their structures. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which I think dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which would give Na+ and HPO4^2- when dissolved.

Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, so I guess this comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^- in solution. I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can lose three protons. The dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^-
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

So, the given solution has both H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). These two ions can react with water to form PO4^3-.

Wait, but how do I calculate the concentration of PO4^3- here? I think I need to consider the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3- and also between H2PO4^- and PO4^3-.

Wait, but since H3PO4 is a weak acid, the deprotonation steps have different Ka values. The given Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, each step is much weaker than the previous.

I remember that the concentration of PO4^3- comes mainly from the deprotonation of HPO4^2- because PO4^3- is the third deprotonated form. Similarly, H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2- and further to PO4^3-.

But wait, H2PO4^- is the second form. So, for each species, I might need to consider their contribution to PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution between HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- or HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? Or maybe it's a mix that leads to a certain pH where these equilibria are established.

First, let's calculate the molarity of each component in the solution.

The
