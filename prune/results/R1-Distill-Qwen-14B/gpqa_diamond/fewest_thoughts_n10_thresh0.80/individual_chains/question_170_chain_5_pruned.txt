Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. Hmm, I remember that spin states are usually represented as vectors, and the expectation value involves some matrix multiplication.

Alright, the state given is (3i,4). Wait, that's a two-component vector, right? So it's probably written as a column vector. So I can write it as |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. But wait, when dealing with quantum states, we usually need to normalize them, right? Do I need to check if this vector is normalized? Because the expectation value calculation depends on the state being normalized. Let me think. The norm would be the square of the magnitude of each component added. So the norm would be |3i|^2 + |4|^2. The magnitude of 3i is 3, so squared is 9. The magnitude of 4 is 4 squared, which is 16. So 9+16=25. So the norm is 25, which means the state is not normalized. So to get the correct expectation value, I should probably normalize the state first.

Wait, but wait. The expectation value formula is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, but since the state isn't normalized, I should first normalize it. So I think the correct approach is to first normalize the state. So the normalized state would be |ψ⟩ = (1/5) [3i;4], because 25 is 5 squared, so 1/5 times the original vector.

Oh wait, but sometimes in these problems, the expectation value is calculated without normalization if it's given in a non-normalized state. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩, but if the state is not normalized, this would give a result scaled by the square of the norm. So maybe I should include the normalization factor when calculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is already normalized, but wait, 3i and 4—9+16 is 25, so the norm squared is 25, so the norm is 5. So the state as given is not normalized. Therefore, the correct normalized state is (1/5)*(3i,4). So I should proceed with this normalized state.

Wait, but maybe
