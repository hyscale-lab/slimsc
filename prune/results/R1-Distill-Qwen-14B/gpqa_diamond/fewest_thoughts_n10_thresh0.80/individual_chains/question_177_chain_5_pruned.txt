Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, but wait, does mass directly affect luminosity here? Well, if they were main-sequence stars, their masses would correlate with luminosities, but maybe that's not the way to go here. The problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so the Stefan-Boltzmann law applies.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (their peak emission wavelengths) are the same. I remember Wien's Law: λ_max * T = constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1*T1 = λ2*T2, and λ1=λ2, so T1=T2. That's a key point. So T1 = T2.

If that's the case, then the temperatures are the same. So when calculating luminosity, L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is same for both, L is proportional to R².

Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1=T2, that's ( (1.5 R2)² ) / (R2² ) = (2.25 R2² ) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. So why isn't it exactly 2.25?

Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, the problem mentions radial velocities. The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, and Star_2 is 700 km/s. But how does that affect luminosity? Radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength, but the question said the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the problem says through spectroscopy, the brightest wavelengths are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are same, but that depends on the Doppler shift.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. When a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be different from the emitted wavelength. But the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max is same for both. So that would imply that (λ1_observed) = (λ2_observed).

But what about the emitted wavelengths? Because if a star is moving, the observed wavelength is λ = λ0 (1 + v_r / c ), using the relativistic Doppler shift formula. But for non-relativistic speeds, v << c, so λ ≈ λ0 (1 + v_r / c ). Since v_r is the radial velocity.

Wait, let's clarify. The star emits at λ0_max = b / T (from Wien's law). But the observed λ is λ_obs = λ0 * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is longer (redshifted). If moving towards, λ_obs is shorter (blueshifted).

In the problem, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed λ is same as emitted.
