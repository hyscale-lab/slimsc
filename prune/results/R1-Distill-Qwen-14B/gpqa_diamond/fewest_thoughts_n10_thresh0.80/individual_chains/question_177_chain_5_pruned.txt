Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Let's see, I need to figure out how much more luminous Star_1 is compared to Star_2. Hmm, the question says that both stars have the same peak wavelength where they appear brightest. I remember something about blackbody radiation and Wien's Law from my studies.

Wait, Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh, interesting, so T1 equals T2. That's helpful.

Now, the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both have the same temperature, T1 = T2, the luminosity should depend on the radius squared. Let me write that down.

So, L1 = 4π R1² σ T⁴ and L2 = 4π R2² σ T⁴. Dividing L1 by L2, the 4π σ T⁴ terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Since R1 is 1.5 R2, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. But wait, wait a second. There's more to the problem. What about the radial velocities?

Oh right, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm. Wait, no, the radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but the question says that the peak wavelengths are the same as measured. Oh, but wait, we already accounted for that by using the same T for both stars. Because if one star is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, but in this case, both have the same observed lambda_max, so their temperatures must be the same. So perhaps the radial velocities don't affect the calculation of luminosity. Because the luminosity calculation is based on
