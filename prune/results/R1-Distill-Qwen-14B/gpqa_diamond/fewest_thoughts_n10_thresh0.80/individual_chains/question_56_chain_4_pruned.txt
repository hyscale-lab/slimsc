Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, transitions between energy levels follow certain selection rules, especially for dipole transitions.

First, I need to recall the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the general selection rules are:

Δn = 0, ±1 (but not zero because that would be no transition)
Wait, no, dipole transitions are usually for Δn = ±1, ±2 maybe? Or is it something else?

Wait, more accurately, for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen, the selection rules are:

Δl = ±1, 0? Or just ±1? I think for dipole transitions, the change in angular momentum quantum number l is Δl = ±1. So l can increase or decrease by 1. And the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1, right? So Δm = 0, ±1.

But wait, the initial state is |3, 0, 0>. So n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0.

The final state is |1, 0, 0>. So n=1, l=0, m=0.

So the transition is from n=3 to n=1, which is a Δn = -2. Hmm, can a single dipole transition do that? Because dipole transitions typically allow Δn = ±1.
