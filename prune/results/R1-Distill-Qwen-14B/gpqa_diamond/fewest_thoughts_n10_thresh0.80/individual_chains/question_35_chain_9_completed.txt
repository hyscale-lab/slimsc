Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, muons are elementary particles, right? But I think the specifics of the particle might not matter here; it's more about the angular momentum operator.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me read the setup again. So, Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Oh wait, wait. So S is a specific matrix. Let me write that out.

So S matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), that's a scalar multiplier. So substituting c, Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by that S matrix. So:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

But wait, since c is a scalar, I can represent Ay as:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ], [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I need to compute that yet. The question is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, so maybe I should think about the properties of the operator Ay first.

Wait, the problem states that S is a 2x2 matrix. Oh, right, the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles are 2x2. Since muons have spin 1/2, that makes sense. So S here is probably the spin operator in the y-direction, but scaled by something, perhaps—since Ay is c times S.

But wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator component usually has components like S_x, S_y, S_z. The eigenvalues for these are ± ħ/2 times some factor. Wait, but here c is h/(4π), and ħ is h/(2π), so c is ħ/2. Oh right, because ħ = h/(2π), so c = (h)/(4π) = ħ/2.

So Ay is (ħ/2) * S. Wait, but S here is the spin matrix. Let me think. For spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are:

S_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
S_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, wait. So in this problem, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as 2 times the S_y matrix in the standard notation. Because S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix. So S here would be 2 * S_y. Because (ħ/2) times S would be S_y. So if S is 2 S_y, then Ay would be c * (2 S_y) = (h/(4π)) * (2 S_y) )

Wait, but let's compute that. Let's see: c is h/(4π), and S is 2 S_y. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * 2 S_y = (h/(2π)) S_y. But h/(2π) is ħ. So Ay = ħ * S_y.

Wait, but that can't be right because S_y's eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. If Ay is ħ * S_y, then the eigenvalues would be ± (ħ * (ħ/2)) )? That would be like (ħ^2)/2. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues of an angular momentum component should have units of angular momentum. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I confused the notation of S. Let's re-examine the problem statement. It says that S is a 2x2 matrix, and its first row is (0, -i), second row (i, 0). So the matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Which is exactly the standard form of the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Wait, no. The Pauli Y matrix is:

[[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, that's exactly the same as the S matrix given here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So, S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

In quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are S_i = (ħ/2) sigma_i, where sigma_i are the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, so in this problem, the operator S here is sigma_y, and Ay is c * sigma_y, where c is h/(4pi). Let's compute that.

c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So Ay = (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, because sigma_y is 2 S_y / ħ, perhaps? Let me think. S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So sigma_y = 2 S_y / ħ.

So, if Ay is c * sigma_y, and c is h/(4pi) = ħ/(2 pi) * 2 pi? Wait, no. No, c is h/(4 pi), which is (2 pi ħ) / (4 pi) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * sigma_y. But sigma_y is 2 S_y / ħ. So substituting that in, Ay = (ħ/2) * (2 S_y / ħ ) ) = S_y.

Wait, that makes Ay equal to S_y. Oh, interesting. So Ay is the spin y-component operator.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be the eigenvalues of S_y. But what are the eigenvalues of S_y?

Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if Ay = S_y, then the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2.

But wait, let's make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix Ay directly.

So the matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the S matrix:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Let me compute that. So each element is multiplied by h/(4π). So the matrix becomes:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ], [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Let me write this matrix as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

I can also note that (h/(4π)) is c. So Ay is a 2x2 matrix with elements:

0 and -i c in the top right,
i c and 0 in the bottom left.

So to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I ) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I ) is:

[ -a       (-i c)       ]
[ i c      -a         ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) ) = a^2 - (i c)(-i c)

Compute the second term: (i c)(-i c) = (-i^2)(c^2) = (-(-1))(c^2) = c^2.

So determinant = a^2 - (c^2) = 0.

So the equation is a^2 - c^2 =0 → a^2 = c^2 → a = ± c.

But wait, c is h/(4π). So a would be ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but earlier I thought that S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if Ay is same as S_y, the eigenvalues should be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the calculation here gives a = ± c = ± h/(4π), which is the same as ± ħ/(2), since ħ = h/(2π). So let's check:

c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) ) = (ħ) * (1/2) → c = ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which matches what I thought earlier. So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but let me think again because I might have gotten confused with the definitions. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the matrix and compute the eigenvalues directly.

Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y. Since sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1, then (ħ/2) * sigma_y would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Yes, that makes sense.

So in this problem, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2. Which is the same as ± h/(4π) because ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2.

So looking at the answer options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or ±h/(2), etc. Wait, the eigenvalues are real. Because intrinsic angular momentum components (like S_y) have real eigenvalues. So any option suggesting eigenvalues with imaginary parts would be incorrect.

Looking at option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be right. So option A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary part is ±1/2, real part ±1. But again, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az. Let me think. The operator A^2 is the square of the angular momentum. Since A is a component, A^2 would involve all components. Wait, but in this case, A is the Y-component. So A^2 is the square of the Y-component operator. However, for spin-1/2 particles, the square of each component is (ħ/2)^2 times the identity matrix. So A^2 would have eigenvalues ( ħ/2 )^2.

Wait, but the eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenvectors of Ay. Now, the eigenfunctions of Ay are the eigenfunctions of A^2 as well because A^2 is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Because for any vector |ψ>, A^2 |ψ> = ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * |ψ>. So any vector is an eigenfunction of A^2. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A^2.

But what about Az? Az is the z-component operator. The eigenfunctions of Ay and Az would be different. Because the Y and Z components don't commute. So if a state is an eigenfunction of Ay, it can't be an eigenfunction of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which is only possible for the eigenstates of A^2 and another component, but not two different components.

So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. That's correct.

Wait, but looking at the statement in option C: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az."

So that's correct. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, the basis functions of the matrix operator. Wait, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its basis is the standard basis vectors. The eigenvectors would form a basis for the vector space. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if they're distinct) would form an orthogonal basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for Ay.

Wait, but the question is about considering which statement is correct during the calculation. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which would be true because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So option D is also a correct statement.

Wait, but now I'm confused because options C and D could both be correct. Let me re-examine.

Looking back at the question, the options are numbered A to D, and the question asks which statement is correct during calculation.

Wait, let me re-examine option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Hmm, so the operator's matrix is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis for R^2 (or C^2, since it's a 2x2 matrix). So the eigenvectors are the basis functions for the space on which the operator acts. So, yes, option D is correct.

Wait, but which of the options is correct? Because the problem is a multiple-choice, only one option is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So in terms of the options, which statements are correct.

Option C: Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. Since A^2 is (ħ/2)^2 I, any vector is an eigenfunction of A^2. So yes, the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A^2. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space (C^2), so they are the basis functions for the operator. So option D is correct.

Wait, but the options might only have one correct. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Looking at the statements:

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. That's correct because because A^2 is a multiple of identity, so any state is an eigenstate, but they can't be eigenstates of Az since Ay and Az don't commute.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Which is true because any operator's eigenvectors form a basis if they are diagonalizable, which it is since it's a 2x2 matrix with two eigenvalues.

So both C and D are correct statements. But since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps only one is correct as per the options.

Wait, checking the options again:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, but the basis functions for the operator are generally the basis vectors of the space it's acting on. If the operator is 2x2, then the standard basis vectors e1 and e2 are the basis functions. But the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) may not necessarily be the standard basis functions. Unless the operator is diagonal in the standard basis, which it's not here because Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], which is not diagonal.

So the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which form a basis, but they are not the standard basis functions. So perhaps the statement is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, hence they are the basis functions of the operator.

Alternatively, the wording in option D is a bit ambiguous. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is correct.

But let's think: the problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of the options is a correct statement.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. That is correct because any vector is an eigenfunction of A^2, but they can't be eigenfunctions of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But perhaps only one option is correct. Let me think about the other options again.

Option C is correct. Option D is correct. Hmm, but perhaps the correct answer is C, because the question is about whether the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of another operator. So perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, but let's think about what the actual question is. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D talks about the basis functions. So for a 2x2 matrix, any set of two eigenvectors that are not scalar multiples of each other will form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) do form the basis functions for the operator. So option D is correct.

Wait, but both C and D are correct. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating them.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the initial calculation of the eigenvalues and see what the options say.

Wait, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: Im part ±2πh or ±h/(2). But eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary part ±1/2, real ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Options C and D are the only possibilities.

Wait, let me check what the question is exactly asking. It says, "During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So which statement is correct about the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. That's correct because A^2 is a multiple of identity, so any state is an eigenfunction. Thus, their eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A^2. But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az because they don't commute.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Hmm. I'm confused why both C and D seem correct. But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az, but can be of A^2. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is option D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the matrix and its eigenvalues.

The matrix Ay is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], with c = ħ/2. So it's a 2x2 matrix.

The eigenvalues are ±c, as we found earlier.

So the eigenvectors for a = +c would satisfy (Ay - c I) |v> = 0.

So (Ay - c I) is:

[ -c      -i c ]

[ i c      -c ]

We can write the equations:

-c v1 -i c v2 = 0

i c v1 - c v2 = 0

Dividing both equations by c (c≠0), we get:

- v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2

i v1 - v2 = 0 → i v1 = v2 → v1 = (v2)/(i) → v1 = -i v2 (since 1/i = -i)

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i v2, v2 ]^T. Let's set v2 = 1, then the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -c, the eigenvector would be [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

These vectors form a basis for the space. So option D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator.

So, both C and D seem correct, but the question is which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps one of the options is incorrect. Let me re-examine option D.

Option D says: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

The term "basis functions" could be a bit ambiguous. The basis functions are the functions that form a basis for the function space. In the case of a matrix operator, the basis functions would be the eigenvectors, which form a basis for the vector space. So yes, option D is correct.

Hmm, but the question presents four options, and the problem is in a multiple-choice format, so only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, as I initially thought, because the question is about the process of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps during the calculation, you realize that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Since A^2 is a multiple of identity, any state is an eigenstate of A^2. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A^2. But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, so they don't share eigenfunctions unless the state is a simultaneous eigenstate, which would require diagonalizing both, but for two non-commuting operators, that's not possible unless they share a common eigenbasis, which they don't.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct, but perhaps option C is a more specific correct statement.

Wait, but I'm not seeing any mistake in the reasoning for option C. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but let me double-check.

The eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2. So which of the statements is correct.

Looking again:

The correct eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π) because ħ = h/(2π). So h/(4π) equals ħ/2.

Looking at the options, none of them directly say this except perhaps none of the options. Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or ±h/(2). That can't be correct because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. So a = ±1 ± i*(1/2). But eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Options C and D are about properties of the eigenfunctions, not the eigenvalues.

So the correct statements are C and D.

But the question is which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps C is the correct option.

Wait, but the problem is a bit tricky. Let me think about each statement again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

Yes, correct. Because A^2 is a multiple of identity, so any state is an eigenstate. And since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct statements. But the problem's options only have one correct answer. So perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps option D is incorrect. Let me think. The matrix operator Ay has a basis of eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for the operator. So D is correct.

But in that case, both C and D are correct. But the problem gives only one correct option.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the question. The question says during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So during the calculation, when you find the eigenvectors, you can check whether they form a basis for the operator. So option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because in the process of finding eigenvectors, you realize that they can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what the correct answer is.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the eigenvectors of Ay can be used as eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)) = ± ħ/2.

Eigenvectors for a=+ħ/2:

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, -i c ]
[ i c, -a ]

Substituting a = c = ħ/2.

So:

[ -ħ/2, -(i)(ħ/2) ]
[ i(ħ/2), -ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

- (ħ/2) v1 - i (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 - i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

i v1 - v2 =0 → i v1 = v2 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for a= -ħ/2, the eigenvector is [ i, 1 ].

So the eigenvectors are the basis functions for the space. So option D is correct.

But since the question is about which statement is correct, and options C and D both seem correct, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the question is about the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and during that calculation, you'd find that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az.

But I'm not certain. Maybe I should look for other reasoning.

Another approach: the operator Ay acts on a two-dimensional space. Its eigenfunctions span this space, so any function in this space can be expressed in terms of these eigenfunctions. So option D would be correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is C, because the operator A^2 commutes with Ay, and thus their eigenfunctions are the same, but Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different.

So, given that, perhaps option C is correct.


The problem involves determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2x2 matrix given by:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( A_y \) is explicitly:
     \[
     A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 
     0 & -i \\ 
     i & 0 
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). This yields:
     \[
     a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0 \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]
   - Since \( \frac{h}{4\pi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), which are real.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - For \( a = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), solving \( (A_y - \frac{\hbar}{2}I)|v\rangle = 0 \) gives the eigenvector proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - For \( a = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), solving \( (A_y + \frac{\hbar}{2}I)|v\rangle = 0 \) gives the eigenvector proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D vector space.

3. **Analysis of the Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) or \( \pm \frac{h}{2} \), and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real (\( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are real and equal to \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a multiple of the identity matrix, making all states eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are distinct.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D vector space on which \( A_y \) acts.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct statements. However, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Option C provides a more specific and relevant insight into the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), making it the most appropriate choice.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
