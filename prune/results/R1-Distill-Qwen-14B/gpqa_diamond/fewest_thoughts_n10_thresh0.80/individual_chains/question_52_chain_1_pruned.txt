Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about how the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels depends on the temperature because of the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, let me get the details straight. The star has a Teff of 6000 K when there are no spots. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh, but wait, does this mean that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is now 5500 K, or is it that the spots are cooler? I think the spots are cooler regions, so the overall average temperature decreases. But in this problem, we're considering the photosphere when spots are present, so the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So maybe the average temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the spots themselves are cooler, so the average flux from the star is lower. However, the problem states that when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So when the spots are covering 40% of the surface, the average Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K in that case.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes: (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots) = ?

In LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, actually, it's n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

Assuming that the partition function is dominated by the ground state, or that the energy
