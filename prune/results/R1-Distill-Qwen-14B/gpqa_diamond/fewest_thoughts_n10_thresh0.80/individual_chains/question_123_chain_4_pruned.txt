Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

So, the problem states that a part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that sounds like a high speed, but I remember that the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So, maybe we need to consider relativistic effects here?

The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh right, so time is different in different frames because of relativity. So I can't just multiply speed by time directly because the time won't be the same in both frames.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. Or is it the other way around? Because from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, right? Because velocity depends on the frame. So, let's clarify that.

In the Galaxy's frame (let's call it frame S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. But according to the problem, from the ejecta's frame (frame S'), the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. That makes sense because velocities are frame-dependent, but in this case, it's a direct approach, so the speed would be the same when considering the relative motion.

Wait, so when you switch frames in a one-dimensional scenario, like moving directly towards each other, the relative speed is the same in both frames. So, in S, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. In S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v =
