Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, so the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. And a positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Wait, so Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma is equal to 1 over the square root of (1 minus (v squared over c squared)). But maybe I don't need the exact velocities right now.

I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and momentum must be conserved. Since both the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis, their momenta are along that axis. The photons, though, are moving in different directions—upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta have both horizontal and vertical components.

Let me think about the conservation of momentum. The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after. Since this is a collision between an electron and a positron, their charges are opposite, but their masses are the same. Oh, but wait, the Lorentz factors are different.

First, I should calculate the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron before the collision.

The relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²), but maybe it's easier to express p in terms of gamma and m. Alternatively, since the problem gives Lorentz factors, I can compute the momentum as p = gamma * m * v, but I need to relate gamma and v.

Wait, another approach: For each particle, the total energy is gamma * m * c squared. And the momentum p is gamma * m * v. But v can be expressed in terms of gamma because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Solving for v, we get v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Alternatively, there's a relation between the momentum and the energy. For a relativistic particle, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c². Wait, no, more accurately, E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. So, let me see, since v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)), p = gamma m c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum as p = gamma * m * v. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, the momentum can be calculated using beta and gamma. Because, beta is v/c, so p = gamma m beta c.

Wait, that's right. Beta is v/c, so p = gamma m beta c. Also, since gamma and beta are related, because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

So for each particle, let's compute their momenta.

The electron is moving to the right (from left) with gamma_e =4. So its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.

But beta_e can be found from gamma_e. Let me compute beta_e for the electron.

Gamma_e =4, so 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_e²). Squaring both sides, 16 = 1/(1 - beta_e²). So 1 - beta_e² = 1/16. Thus, beta_e² =15/16. So beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, so 3.872 /4 is approximately 0.968. So beta_e ≈ 0.9682.

So the electron's momentum is p_e =4 * m_e * 0.9682 * c.

Similarly, the positron is moving to the left (from right) with gamma_p =2. So its momentum is p_p = 2 * m_e * beta_p * c, but since it's moving to the left, its momentum is negative.

What's beta_p? For gamma_p=2, gamma =2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2). So 4=1/(1-beta_p^2) → 1-beta_p^2 =1/4 → beta_p^2=3/4 → beta_p= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So the positron's momentum is p_p = 2 * m_e * 0.8660 * c, but since it's moving to the left, p_p = -2 * m_e * 0.8660 * c.

Wait, but wait—do I have to consider the positron's direction? Because the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction, so its momentum is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p.

Calculating each:

p_e =4 * m_e * sqrt(15)/4 * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c ≈ m_e * 3.872 c.

Wait, wait:

Wait, 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) is sqrt(15), so yes, p_e = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.

Similarly, p_p is 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) * m_e * c, but negative. So that's m_e * sqrt(3
