Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity. Let's see what it's about.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The problem asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh wait, right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, wait, I'm not too sure about that. Let me think. So the formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²). But wait, that's for when you're adding two velocities from different frames. But wait, in this case, are both astronauts moving in the same direction? So the relative speed would be the difference between their velocities, but using the relativistic formula.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is that if two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them is not simply u - v. Because in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. So let me get this straight.

So astronaut 1 has speed u=0.6c, astronaut 2 has v=0.5c, same direction. So from astronaut 2's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 1? That's the relative speed.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c relative to the stationary observer, and the second at 0.5c, what's the speed of the first as seen by the second?

Wait, wait, no. The way to calculate the relative speed is to use the velocity transformation formula. Because each astronaut is in their own frame. But wait, no. Wait: in the stationary frame, the two are moving in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at a certain speed. Alternatively, from the second's perspective, the first is moving at a certain speed. Either way, we need to compute the relative speed using the relativistic formula.

Wait, the formula for the relative speed u' when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction in the lab frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, I'm not sure if it's (u - v) or (v - u). Let me get that right. Let's say in the lab frame, object A is moving at u and object B at v, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

In the lab frame, B is moving at v. So in A's frame, which is moving at u, B's speed would be v' = (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, that makes sense because if u is larger than v (same direction), then v' would be negative, meaning B is moving backward relative to A. But in this problem, both are moving in the same direction, so u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So u is larger than v, so v' (B's speed in A's frame) would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approx -0.1428c. But since we're talking about speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let's see the options again. Option C says 0.14c, and option D also 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. But wait, the question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. So either way, the speed is positive, so it's 0.14c.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c, but you can't just subtract like that in relativity. So the correct approach is to apply the velocity addition formula. So the relative speed is (v - u) in the same direction, divided by (1 - (u v)/(c²)}.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So relative velocity from A's frame would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → -0.142857c. The negative indicates direction; since the speed is a magnitude, it's 0.142857c, approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that would point me towards options C and D, which both have 0.14c.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. So for each astronaut, I need to calculate their relativistic energies and sum them.

Wait, each has a rest mass, but their speeds are given. The total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

So the energy of a relativistic object is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut 1: mass is 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2: mass is 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approx 1.1547. Let me compute it more accurately: sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² = approximately 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower than our calculated value.

So if I look at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc^2, which would be the correct choice. So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction with speeds \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1
Mass \( m_1 = 2m \), speed \( v_1 = 0.6c \):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2
Mass \( m_2 = 3m \), speed \( v_2 = 0.5c \):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
