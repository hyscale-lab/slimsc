Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. I think the key here is that both stars are being treated as black bodies, so I should probably use the black body radiation formulas.

Alright, let's jot down the given data:

- Radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- Mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, right? Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their lambda_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is the same, then T is the same.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the astronomers found the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest are the same. So both stars have the same T? Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if their lambda_max is the same, their temperatures are equal. Okay, so T1 = T2. 

But wait, I also remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius
