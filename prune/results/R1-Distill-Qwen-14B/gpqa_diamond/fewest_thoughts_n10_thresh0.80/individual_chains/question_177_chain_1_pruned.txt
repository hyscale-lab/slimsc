Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh, wait, but wait a secondâ€”does mass matter here? Because the question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to temperature and radius. So maybe the mass part is a red herring or maybe it's used for something else, like figuring out the type of star or something. Hmm.

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength where a star emits most strongly is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, the question also mentions radial velocities. The radial velocity is the speed at which the stars are moving towards or away from us. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving much, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength would shift based on their velocities.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So spec says that the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. But if the star is moving, the observed peak wavelength would be different from the actual emitted one. So perhaps the actual emitted wavelengths are different, but because of the Doppler shift, they appear the same.

So let's clarify the situation. Let me denote:

Star_1:
- Radius R1 = 1.5 R2
- Mass M1 = 1.5 M2
- Radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s
- Observed peak wavelength lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs

Star_2:
- Radius R2
- Mass M2
- Radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s
- Observed peak wavelength lambda2_obs = lambda1_obs

But wait, the actual emitted peak wavelengths (lambda1_emit and lambda2_emit) are different because of their velocities. So let's think about the Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) )

Wait, but wait, the formula depends on the direction of motion. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, leading to a redshift (longer wavelength). If moving towards, blueshift (shorter wavelength). Since Star_1 has v=0, its observed wavelength is same as emitted. Star_2 has v=700 km/s. But wait, the question says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs.

So, lambda1_emit = lambda1
