Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. The researcher introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the coding sequence. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the construct's plus strand sequence and found an issue.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to find what's wrong. Let's think about the structure of a coding sequence. The beginning should have a start codon (ATG), and it should be followed by the coding sequence for the protein, including any added tags.

The plus strand starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, the start. Then TAC is tyrosine, next codon is CCA (proline), etc. Wait, but the construct includes a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the sequence should have the HA tag before the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the HA tag isn't properly included. Let me think about the reading frame. Alternatively, perhaps there's a stop codon early in the sequence.

Looking at the sequence, after the initial ATG, let's parse the codons:

ATG (Met) starts the sequence. Next codon is TAC (tyr), then CCA (pro), TAC (tyr) again. Hmm. The HA tag's sequence is usually around YPYDHHV (if I remember correctly), but maybe it's in the construct. But wait, the problem says the HA is added at the N-terminus. So perhaps the DNA adds HA before the GADD45G starts.

Wait, looking at the sequence, the start is ATG, which is the beginning of the HA tag or the GADD45G? Wait, the HA is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence followed by GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, which would be the start of the HA tag. But perhaps the HA isn't included correctly.

Wait, perhaps the issue is a stop codon in the HA sequence. Let's see, the provided sequence is the coding (sense) strand. Let's look for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). Let me go through the sequence:

Looking at the first few codons:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GTG AGT GCT GCT GTC GGC GCAGCGTCAGG GCT GCCT CA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AGT CTT GAC CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGC TGC GCC GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGCGAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT TAG TGC GCG TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAT TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CTG GAG AAG CT CAG CCG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG AGC GTT AGC GAC TGG GTC GCC CAG CAT CAC CCT CCCC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, I'll look for the stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in triplets:

Looking through the sequence:

...CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT TAG TGC GCG...

Wait, here's TAG. TAG is a stop codon. So the coding sequence has a TAG in frame. Let me count the position.

Wait, the sequence from the start:

The first 60 or so nucleotides: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So, looking for TAG in the triplet:

...ACT CGA CAT TAG TGC GCG TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CT...

So, the triplet before TAG is CAT, then TAG. So that's a stop codon at this point. So the coding sequence has a premature stop codon, TAG, in frame.

That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein, not overexpression. So the protein might be expressed but not full-length, hence not detected as overexpressed.

So the problem is that a stop codon exists in the coding sequence before the intended end. So why is this happening? Let's think about how the construct was made. The researcher added the HA tag at the N-terminus. Perhaps during the cloning, a stop codon was introduced inadvertently.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early because of a stop codon in the coding sequence. So that would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed.
