Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I remember that each of these techniques can give different clues about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups. Broad peaks in that region are typically from either alcohols or carboxylic acids. If it were an alcohol, the peak is usually a bit broader, but carboxylic acids have very strong, broad O-H stretches as well. Wait, but there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, the 1700 cm^-1 peak is around the range for carbonyl groups (C=O). That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a carbonyl. Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or perhaps an ester or amide? Wait, but amides usually have lower carbonyl peaks, maybe around 1650.

Wait, but in the FTIR, a very broad peak at 3000 could also indicate an alcohol or maybe a phenol. Phenols have broad O-H stretches. Or maybe a carboxylic acid. But if there's a carbonyl at 1700, that might suggest a ketone or ester. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 as well. But then there's the second peak at 1650. Maybe that's a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring or maybe an ester with some conjugation.

Looking at the 1H NMR: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there are double bonds. So the compound has some sort of unsaturation. Maybe a double bond or aromatic protons. Also, the fact that there are multiple peaks in the NMR indicates a fairly complex structure, perhaps with branching or different types of protons.

Now, the Mass Spec data: the fragment peak at m/z 45
