Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that someone prepared an unknown compound and used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which I remember usually corresponds to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those look like carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or maybe an aldehyde, but wait, the 1650 might indicate something else, like an ester or a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps a conjugated double bond nearby. Wait, or maybe it's a carbonyl in a ring, like a cycloketone or something.

The NMR part says there are several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. The mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments would give that.

The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Let me break down each clue.

First, the IR. The very broad peak around 3000 is likely an O-H stretch. The broadness suggests it's an alcohol (because in carboxylic acids, it's usually a very broad and strong peak too, but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps it's an alcohol because the broadness can also be due to hydrogen bonding in OH groups.

The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. So, this indicates two different carbonyl groups? Or maybe one strong peak and another slightly lower. Wait, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch for ketones, aldehydes, esters, maybe amides. 1650 is a bit lower, which could be an ester (maybe the carbonyl is at around 1730 for esters, so 1650 might not fit). Alternatively, maybe it's conjugated. For example
