Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about a proton and antiproton annihilating into two A+ and two A- particles. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV, but wait, that's the rest energy, right? So m_A c² = 300 MeV.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, maybe that means it's non-relativistic. So when the antiproton is slow, the proton is probably at rest, or maybe the system is in some specific frame. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the initial setup.

So, in particle physics, when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other particles. The key here is conservation of energy and momentum. Since the system is initially a proton and an antiproton, I should probably consider their rest masses and any kinetic energy they have.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the initial kinetic energy is small compared to their rest mass energies. The proton is a baryon, and the antiproton is its antiparticle. Their rest masses are the same, right? The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the problem says the mass of A is 300 MeV. So each A+ and A- has a rest energy of 300 MeV.

Wait, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A
