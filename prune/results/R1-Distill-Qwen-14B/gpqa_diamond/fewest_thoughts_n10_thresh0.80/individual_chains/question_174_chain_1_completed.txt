Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus with mass M is initially at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The first fragment is twice as massive as the other, and together their rest masses add up to 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

The rest masses: the initial rest mass is M, and the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99M. So each fragment's rest mass is... Well, let's denote the less massive one as m, so the other is 2m. Then m + 2m = 0.99M → 3m = 0.99M → m = 0.33M. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the sum is 0.99M. So 3m = 0.99M → m = 0.33M, but then the more massive fragment is 2m, which is 0.66M. So, each fragment's mass is 0.33M and 0.66M. 

Wait, but the initial nucleus had a rest mass of M. So the rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c² (since E=mc²). But maybe we can work in units where c=1, so energy and mass are related directly. 

In any case, after fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies. Wait, but we have to consider the conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal and opposite. 

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Then their momenta must satisfy p1 = -p2. 

But since momentum is gamma*m*v, and since each fragment is moving in opposite directions, their gamma factors and velocities will relate accordingly. 

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the conservation of energy and momentum in terms of velocities. Let's see.

The total energy after fission is the sum of the energies of the two fragments. Each fragment's energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. 

Wait, but the rest masses are 0.33M and 0.66M. So, their rest energies are 0.33*300 GeV = 99 GeV and 0.66*300 GeV = 198 GeV. 

So the total rest energy is 99 + 198 = 297 GeV. 

The initial nucleus had a rest energy of 300 GeV, so the total energy after fission is 300 GeV + (kinetic energies of both fragments).

Wait, but wait, after the fission, the two fragments' rest masses add up to 99% of M, which is 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, and the rest energy after is 297 GeV. So the remaining 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy of both fragments. 

So, the sum of their kinetic energies is 3 GeV. 

But wait, the problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which I'll call T1. The other fragment's kinetic energy is T2, so T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. 

Now, because of momentum conservation, the momenta must cancel each other. Let me denote the velocities as v1 for the more massive fragment (mass 0.66M) and v2 for the less massive (0.33M). 

Momentum for each fragment: p = gamma * m * v. 

So, gamma1 * (0.66M) * v1 = gamma2 * (0.33M) * v2. 

Wait, but since momentum vectors are opposite, perhaps it's better to set up as p1 = -p2. So, gamma1*(0.66M)*v1 = gamma2*(0.33M)*v2. 

But I can cancel M from both sides: gamma1*0.66 v1 = gamma2*0.33 v2. 

Simplify: (gamma1/gamma2) * (v1/v2) = (0.33)/(0.66) ) → 0.5. 

Hmm, but I'm not sure that helps directly. Maybe there's another approach. 

Wait, in the case of non-relativistic speeds, we can use classical mechanics. In that scenario, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and momentum is mv. 

In the classical case, since the two fragments have masses m1=0.66M and m2=0.33M, and momentum vectors opposite, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1 = (0.66/0.33) v1 = 2 v1. 

Now, the kinetic energies would be T1 = (1/2) m1 v1², T2 = (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) = 2 m2 v1². 

But m2 is 0.33 M, so T2 = 2 * 0.33 M v1². 

Similarly, T1 = 0.5 *0.66 M v1². 

So, T1 + T2 = 0.5 *0.66 M v1² + 2 *0.33 M v1² = let's compute that.

0.5 *0.66 = 0.33, so T1 is 0.33 M v1². 
2 *0.33 = 0.66, so T2 is 0.66 M v1². 

Adding them together: 0.33 + 0.66 = 0.99 M v1². 

And this sum is 3 GeV. So:

0.99 M v1² = 3 GeV → M v1² = 3 / 0.99 ≈ 3.0303 GeV.

So T1_classical = 0.33 * (3.0303) ≈ 1 GeV. 

Wait, but that's a rough calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. So, in the classical case, T1 is (1/2) m1 v1². So solving for v1:

But perhaps an easier way is to use the fact that in non-relativistic case, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But let's find v1 and v2 in terms of each other first. 

In non-relativistic case, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1. 

So v2 = (0.66 / 0.33) v1 = 2 v1.

Then, the kinetic energies:

T1 = (1/2) m1 v1²
T2 = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

So, T1 + T2 = (0.5 m1 v1²) + (2 m2 v1² ) 

= (0.5 * 0.66 M v1²) + (2 * 0.33 M v1² )

= (0.33 M v1²) + (0.66 M v1² ) 

= 0.99 M v1² = 3 GeV → M v1² = 3 / 0.99 ≈ 3.0303 GeV.

So T1 = 0.33 * (3.0303) = about 1 GeV. 

Wait, 0.33 *3.0303 is approximately 1 GeV. But let me calculate it more accurately. 3/0.99 is approximately 3.030303 GeV. So:

M v1² = 3.0303 GeV → T1 = 0.5 * 0.66 M v1² = 0.33 * 3.0303 ≈ 1. GeV. 

So the classical T1 is about 1 GeV. 

But wait, this is just the classical approximation. The correct value might be different because of relativistic effects.

Wait, but 3 GeV is a small fraction compared to 300 GeV. Because 3 GeV is 3e9 eV, while 300 GeV is 3e11 eV. So 3 GeV is 0.01% of M's rest energy. So maybe the velocities are non-relativistic, and the classical approximation is a good one. But the problem is asking for the difference between the correct and classical T1. So perhaps the difference is small, but perhaps it's not.

Wait, but let's think about the relativistic case. 

In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is gamma m c². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². 

Total energy is the sum of the two fragments' energies. 

So, for fragment 1 (mass 0.66M), energy is gamma1 (0.66M c²) = gamma1 *0.66E_initial, where E_initial is 300 GeV. 

Similarly, fragment 2's energy is gamma2 * 0.33 *300 GeV. 

The total energy after fission is 300 GeV (rest of initial) + T1 + T2 = gamma1 * (0.66 *300) + gamma2 * (0.33 *300).

But wait, actually, the initial nucleus was at rest, so its total energy was M c² =300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two fragments. So:

gamma1 *0.66M c^2 + gamma2 *0.33M c^2 = 300 GeV + (T1 + T2)

But wait, earlier we found that T1 + T2 =3 GeV. So:

gamma1 *0.66 + gamma2 *0.33 = (300 +3 ) / 300 → 303 / 300 = 1.01. 

Because M c² is 300 GeV, so:

gamma1 *0.66 + gamma2 *0.33 = 1.01. 

Additionally, we have conservation of momentum. Each fragment's momentum is gamma m v. So:

gamma1 * 0.66 M v1 = gamma2 *0.33 M v2 

M cancels: 0.66 gamma1 v1 = 0.33 gamma2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2. 

Hmm, but v is related via the relation from momentum. 

Alternatively, since their momenta must be equal and opposite, but perhaps I should express v2 in terms of v1. 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can find a relation between gamma1 and gamma2 and v1 and v2.

Another approach: in the center of mass frame, which is the same as the initial rest frame, the two fragments must move with equal and opposite momenta.

But perhaps I can use the fact that the total momentum is zero:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. 

Where m1 =0.66M, m2=0.33M.

So, (gamma1 * 0.66M * v1) = (gamma2 * 0.33M * v2) → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2. 

Hmm, so v2 = (2 gamma1 v1) / gamma2. 

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I should express v1 and v2 in terms of each other, and then find gamma1 and gamma2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make use of the fact that the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². 

Wait, but perhaps I can express everything in terms of beta and gamma. Let me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c. 

Then, since momentum is gamma m v = gamma m beta c. 

So, from conservation of momentum:

gamma1 * 0.66 M beta1 c = gamma2 * 0.33 M beta2 c. 

The M and c terms cancel, so:

gamma1 * 0.66 beta1 = gamma2 * 0.33 beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Hmm, that's one equation. 

Another equation comes from the conservation of energy. The total energy after fission is:

gamma1 * 0.66 M c² + gamma2 * 0.33 M c² = (300 GeV) + 3 GeV.

Because the initial energy was 300 GeV, and the kinetic energy after is 3 GeV. So:

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = (303 GeV) / (300 GeV) ) → 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.01. 

So, that's the second equation.

So now I have two equations:

1. 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

2. 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.01.

Hmm, but I have four variables here: gamma1, beta1, gamma2, beta2. So I need another relationship between these variables. 

I know that for any object, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). 

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the velocities are non-relativistic, but wait, the problem is asking for the difference between the correct and classical T1, implying that the classical approximation may not be perfect. But perhaps the velocities are high enough that we can't neglect relativistic effects. 

Wait, but 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy. Let me see: the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, so the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass. So perhaps the velocities are non-relativistic, and the gamma factors are close to 1. 

Wait, let's check. For each fragment, the kinetic energy is a fraction of their rest mass. For example, the more massive fragment's rest energy is 0.66 *300 GeV= 198 GeV. If its kinetic energy is (say) 2 GeV, then (gamma-1) *198 GeV ≈ 2 GeV → gamma ≈ 1 + 2/198 ≈ 1.0101. So gamma is about 1.0101, which is close to 1. So perhaps relativistic effects are small, and the classical approximation is a good one, but let's proceed.

So, let's try to solve the two equations.

Equation 1: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2. 

Equation 2: 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.01.

Hmm, but perhaps I can express gamma2 in terms of gamma1 from equation 2, then substitute into equation 1.

From equation 2:

0.33 gamma2 = 1.01 - 0.66 gamma1 → gamma2 = [1.01 - 0.66 gamma1] / 0.33.

So,

gamma2 = (1.01/0.33) - (0.66/0.33) gamma1 → gamma2 ≈ 3.0606 - 2 gamma1.

Wait, 0.66/0.33 is 2, yeah. So gamma2 = (1.01 /0.33) - 2 gamma1 → approximately 3.0606 - 2 gamma1.

Now, substitute this into equation 1.

Equation 1: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta2 = (2 gamma1 beta1) / gamma2 → from equation 1.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Another approach: express beta in terms of gamma. 

Beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2). 

So, beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2), and beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).

Substituting into equation 1:

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2) = gamma2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2^2).

Hmm, this looks complicated, but perhaps with the assumption that gamma is close to 1, I can approximate sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2) as approximately (gamma -1)/(gamma) or something. Alternatively, using a Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 when x is small.

Wait, since gamma is close to 1, let's let x = gamma -1, which is small. Then, gamma ≈1 + x.

Then, 1/gamma^2 ≈ (1/(1 + x))^2 ≈ 1 - 2x. So,

sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2) = sqrt(1 - (1 - 2x)) ) → sqrt(2x) = sqrt(2 gamma - 2). But perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, for small x, gamma ≈1 + x, so sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1 - 2x)) ) → sqrt(2x) ≈ sqrt(2 (gamma-1)).

Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's make the approximation that gamma is approximately 1, and see what we get.

Assume gamma1 ≈1 + a, and gamma2 ≈1 + b, where a and b are small.

Then, from equation 2: 0.66 (1+a) + 0.33 (1 + b) = 1.01 → 0.66 + 0.66 a + 0.33 + 0.33 b =1.01 → 0.99 + 0.66 a + 0.33 b = 1.01 → 0.66 a + 0.33 b = 0.02 → 2 a + b = (0.02 / 0.33) → approximately 0.0606.

Equation 1: 2 (1+a) sqrt(1 - 1/(1+a)^2) ≈ 2 (1+a) sqrt(1 - (1 - 2a)) → 2(1+a) sqrt(2a) ≈ 2 (1+a) sqrt(2a).

Similarly, for gamma2: 1 + b ≈ gamma2.

So, equation 1: 2 (1+a) sqrt(2a) ≈ (1 + b) sqrt(2b).

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Alternatively, let's consider the non-relativistic case and compare to the relativistic case to find the difference.

In the non-relativistic case, we found T1 ≈ 1 GeV. Let's see what the relativistic case gives.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the correct T1, then subtract the classical T1 to find the difference.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, T1 is (1/2) m1 v1^2 =0.5 *0.66 M v1^2.

But from earlier, M v1^2 = 3.0303 GeV → T1 = 0.5 *0.66 *3.0303 ≈ 1 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma1 -1) m1 c² = (gamma1 -1)*0.66 *300 GeV.

We need to find gamma1.

But from equation 2, 0.66 gamma1 +0.33 gamma2 =1.01.

And from equation 1: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But with beta1 = v1/c and beta2 =v2/c.

But perhaps another approach is to consider that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So, T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, as we found, T1 is approximately 1 GeV, and T2 is 2 GeV. 

But in the correct (relativistic) case, let's see. 

But wait, perhaps the correct T1 is larger than the classical value. Because in the relativistic case, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's (gamma-1)mc². So, for a given velocity, the kinetic energy is higher. 

But wait, in this scenario, the velocities might be lower because the gamma factor increases. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct T1 is higher, leading to a larger difference. But without exact calculations, it's hard to say.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is more about the difference between the correct and the classical T1. Let me think about the given options. The options are in the range of MeV, so about 1-20 MeV. 

Wait, because 3 GeV is 3000 MeV. So the difference between the correct and classical T1 would be a small fraction of that. 

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV (1000 MeV). But in reality, perhaps the correct T1 is a bit different. Let me think of a way to compute the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct method is to compute the correct T1 and the classical T1 and find the difference. 

Wait, perhaps I should compute the correct value. Let me think again.

We have two equations:

1. 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.01.

2. 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

And the third equation comes from the fact that the two fragments have velocities in opposite directions, so their momenta are equal in magnitude.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a substitution to reduce variables.

Let me express gamma2 from equation 2.

From equation 2: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Let me square both sides: 4 gamma1^2 beta1² = gamma2^2 beta2².

But beta² = 1 - 1/gamma².

So, 4 gamma1^2 (1 -1/gamma1^2) = gamma2^2 (1 -1/gamma2^2).

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe I can rearrange it.

Equation:

4 gamma1^2 (1 -1/gamma1^2) = gamma2^2 (1 -1/gamma2^2).

Simplify the left side: 4 gamma1^2 ( (gamma1² -1)/gamma1² ) ) = 4 (gamma1²-1).

Right side: gamma2^2 ( (gamma2² -1)/gamma2^2 ) ) = gamma2² -1.

So equation becomes:

4 (gamma1² -1) = gamma2² -1 → 4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1 → gamma2² = 4 gamma1^2 -3.

Hmm, so gamma2 = sqrt(4 gamma1^2 -3).

Now, from equation 1: 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.01.

Substitute gamma2 from above.

So:

0.66 gamma1 +0.33 * sqrt(4 gamma1^2 -3) =1.01.

This is an equation in gamma1. Let me try to solve it numerically.

Let me denote x = gamma1. So the equation becomes:

0.66 x + 0.33 * sqrt(4x² -3) =1.01.

Divide both sides by 0.33 to simplify:

2x + sqrt(4x² -3) = 3.0606 (since 1.01/0.33 ≈3.0606).

Let me write it as:

sqrt(4x² -3) = 3.0606 -2x.

Square both sides:

4x² -3 = (3.0606 -2x)^2 → 4x² -3 = 9.3648 - 12.2424 x +4x².

Subtract 4x² from both sides:

-3 =9.3648 -12.2424 x → -3 -9.3648 = -12.2424 x → -12.3648 = -12.2424 x → x ≈12.3648/12.2424 ≈ 1.00976.

So gamma1 ≈1.00976.

Then, gamma2 = sqrt(4*(1.00976)^2 -3) → compute 4*(1.0196) → about 4.0784. Subtract 3 → 1.0784. sqrt(1.0784) ≈1.0385.

So, gamma1≈1.00976, gamma2≈1.0385.

Now, compute the kinetic energy T1 = (gamma1 -1)*m1 c².

m1=0.66 M, and M c²=300 GeV → m1 c²=0.66 *300=198 GeV.

So, T1 = (1.00976-1) *198 → 0.00976 *198 → approximately 1.93 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier we thought the sum of T1 and T2 is 3 GeV. Wait, let's compute T2 as well.

T2 = (gamma2 -1) * m2 c^2 → m2 c^2=0.33 *300=99 GeV.

gamma2≈1.0385 → T2 = (1.0385-1)*99 ≈0.0385 *99 ≈3.81 GeV.

So, T1 ≈1.93 GeV, T2≈3.81 GeV. Sum is about 5.74 GeV. Hmm, but earlier we had the sum as 3 GeV. Wait, this suggests a mistake. Because in our initial setup, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV, so this result doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's recheck.

Wait, wait: the initial nucleus has rest energy 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the two fragments' rest energies plus their kinetic energies. 

The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 0.99 M, which is 297 GeV. So the sum of the rest energies is 297 GeV. So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, so the total energy after fission is 300 GeV plus the kinetic energies. 

So, the total energy after fission is 300 + T1 + T2.

But the total energy is also the sum of the energies of the two fragments: gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c².

So,

gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 = 300 + T1 + T2.

But T1 = (gamma1-1)*198, T2=(gamma2-1)*99.

So, T1 + T2 = (gamma1 -1)*198 + (gamma2 -1)*99 = gamma1*198 -198 + gamma2*99 -99 = 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 -297.

So,

gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 =300 + (198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 -297).

Simplify right side: 300 -297 +198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =3 +198 gamma1 +99 gamma2.

So, 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =3 +198 gamma1 +99 gamma2.

Which implies 0=3 → which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-express the energy equation correctly.

The initial energy is 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is:

E1 + E2 = gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = gamma1 *198 GeV + gamma2 *99 GeV.

This must equal the initial energy plus the kinetic energy (since after fission, the kinetic energies are added). So,

gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 =300 + (T1 +T2).

But T1 = (gamma1 -1)*198, T2 = (gamma2 -1)*99.

So,

gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 =300 + (gamma1 *198 -198 + gamma2 *99 -99).

Simplify right side: 300 + gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 -198 -99.

Which is 300 + (gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99) -297.

So,

gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 = (300 -297) + gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99.

Which becomes:

gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 =3 + gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99.

Subtract same terms from both sides: 0=3 → which is impossible. So, there's a mistake in the setup.

Hmm, I think I see the mistake. The initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is M c² =300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two fragments, which includes their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. So,

E1 + E2 = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2).

Which is (m1 + m2) c² + (T1 + T2) =0.99 M c² + (T1 + T2).

But the initial energy is M c², so:

0.99 M c² + (T1 + T2) = M c² → T1 + T2 = M c² -0.99 M c² = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV.

Which aligns with our earlier finding.

So, the earlier approach was correct. So, going back, the mistake must be in the substitution when solving for gamma1 and gamma2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the fact that in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. 

Wait, but that's what we've been doing.

Hmm, perhaps I should instead consider that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, so T1 = (gamma1 -1)*198, T2= (gamma2 -1)*99, and T1 + T2=3 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 -1)*198 + (gamma2 -1)*99 =3 → 198 gamma1 -198 +99 gamma2 -99=3 → 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2=300.

So, equation 1: 198 gamma1 +99 gamma2=300 → simplifying by dividing by 99: 2 gamma1 + gamma2=3.0303.

Equation 2: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But from earlier, momentum equation gives 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2 → equation 2.

Hmm, but I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I can express beta in terms of gamma.

Beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So,

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2) = gamma2 sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2).

Let me denote gamma1 as x, so gamma2 = (3.0303 -2 x).

So,

2 x sqrt(1 -1/x²) = (3.0303 -2x) sqrt(1 - 1/( (3.0303 -2x)^2 )).

This is a complicated equation to solve, but perhaps I can make an approximate solution.

We can assume that gamma is close to 1, so x ≈1 and gamma2≈1 as well. Let me try x=1.01.

Then, gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.01=3.0303-2.02=1.0103.

Compute left side: 2*1.01 * sqrt(1 -1/(1.01)^2 ) → 2.02 * sqrt(1 - (1/(1.0201)) ) → 2.02 * sqrt(1 -0.98039) → 2.02 * sqrt(0.01961) → 2.02 * 0.1400 → approx 0.283.

Right side: 1.0103 * sqrt(1 -1/(1.0103)^2) → 1.0103 * sqrt(1- 1/(1.020606)) →1.0103 * sqrt(1-0.9800) →1.0103 * sqrt(0.02) →1.0103 * 0.1414 → approx 0.143.

So left side is 0.283, right side is 0.143. Not equal.

Hmm, so perhaps x is a bit higher.

Let me try x=1.02.

Gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.02=3.0303-2.04=0.9903. Wait, that's less than 1. Gamma can't be less than 1. So x must be less than 1.515, because gamma2 can't be negative.

Wait, when x=1.5, gamma2=3.0303 -3=0.0303, which is less than 1, which is impossible.

So x must be <=1.515.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try x=1.005.

gamma2=3.0303 -2*1.005=3.0303-2.01=1.0203.

Left side: 2*1.005 * sqrt(1 -1/(1.005)^2 ) → 2.01 * sqrt(1 -1/1.010025) → 2.01 * sqrt(1 -0.990064) → 2.01* sqrt(0.009936) → 2.01 * 0.09968 → approx 0.200.

Right side: gamma2=1.0203 → sqrt(1 -1/(1.0203)^2 ) → sqrt(1 -1/1.04121) → sqrt(1-0.9609) → sqrt(0.0391) → 0.1977.

So, right side: 1.0203 *0.1977 → approx 0.2014.

So left side is 0.200, right side≈0.2014. Close enough, given the approximations.

So, x≈1.005, gamma1=1.005.

Then, gamma2=3.0303 -2*(1.005)=3.0303-2.01=1.0203.

So, T1=(gamma1 -1)*198 → (0.005)*198=0.99 GeV.

T2=(gamma2 -1)*99 →0.0203 *99=1.9997≈2 GeV.

Sum T1+T2=0.99 +2=2.99≈3 GeV. Which fits.

So, the correct T1 is approximately 1 GeV.

But in the classical approximation, T1 is also about 1 GeV. So the difference between the correct and classical T1 would be negligible? But the options are in the MeV range. Hmmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the approximation I made (x=1.005) isn't precise enough. Let me try a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct T1 is slightly higher than the classical value, leading to a small difference of a few MeV.

Wait, but in the relativistic calculation, I found T1≈0.99 GeV, whereas in the classical case it's 1 GeV. So the difference is 0.01 GeV, which is 10 MeV. But wait, 0.99 GeV is 990 MeV, so the classical value is 1000 MeV, so the difference is 10 MeV.

Wait, wait, no: the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV. The classical T1 is 1000 MeV. So the difference is 10 MeV.

But wait, according to the relativistic calculation, the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV (990 MeV), and the classical T1 is 1 GeV (1000 MeV). So the difference is 10 MeV, which is option C.

Hmm, but wait, in the calculation earlier I thought the correct T1 was about 0.99 GeV. But in another approach, the correct T1 would be different.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation.

Wait, using the more precise gamma1=1.005, T1=(1.005-1)*198=0.005 *198=0.99 GeV.

In the classical case, we had T1=1 GeV. So the correct T1 is less than the classical, so the difference is 10 MeV. So the question is, what is the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1? So correct T1 is 990 MeV, classical is 1000 MeV. So difference is 10 MeV.

So the correct answer is C)10 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and classical mechanics to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The nucleus has a rest mass \( M \) and rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - After fission, two fragments are formed:  
     - Fragment 1 (more massive): \( 0.66M \)  
     - Fragment 2 (less massive): \( 0.33M \)  
   - The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is \( 0.99M \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) of total energy as kinetic energy for both fragments.

2. **Conservation Laws**:  
   - **Momentum Conservation**: Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. This implies the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.  
   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments. The initial rest energy is \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \), and the total kinetic energy of the fragments is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   The kinetic energy of a fragment is given by:  
   \[
   T = (\gamma - 1) m c^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For Fragment 1 (more massive), the kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) \cdot 198 \, \text{GeV}
   \]  
   Similarly, for Fragment 2:  
   \[
   T_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) \cdot 99 \, \text{GeV}
   \]  
   The total kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

4. **Classical Approximation**:  
   In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). Using momentum conservation, the velocities of the fragments are related by:  
   \[
   m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \implies v_2 = \frac{m_1}{m_2} v_1 = 2 v_1.
   \]  
   Substituting into the kinetic energy expressions:  
   \[
   T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 2 m_2 v_1^2.
   \]  
   The total kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + 2 m_2 v_1^2 = 0.99 M v_1^2.
   \]  
   Setting \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), we solve for \( M v_1^2 \):  
   \[
   M v_1^2 = \frac{3}{0.99} \approx 3.0303 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]  
   Thus, the classical kinetic energy of Fragment 1 is:  
   \[
   T_{1,\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 0.33 \cdot 3.0303 \approx 1 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

5. **Relativistic Calculation**:  
   Using relativistic mechanics, the total energy of each fragment is:  
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2, \quad E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2.
   \]  
   From energy conservation:  
   \[
   \gamma_1 \cdot 198 + \gamma_2 \cdot 99 = 300 + 3 \implies 198 \gamma_1 + 99 \gamma_2 = 300.
   \]  
   Dividing by \( 99 \):  
   \[
   2 \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 = 3.0303.
   \]  
   From momentum conservation:  
   \[
   2 \gamma_1 \beta_1 = \gamma_2 \beta_2,
   \]  
   where \( \beta = v/c \) and \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} \). Solving these equations numerically, we find:  
   \[
   \gamma_1 \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.0203.
   \]  
   The relativistic kinetic energy of Fragment 1 is:  
   \[
   T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) \cdot 198 = (1.005 - 1) \cdot 198 \approx 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

6. **Difference Between Correct and Classical \( T_1 \)**:  
   The classical \( T_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \), and the relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta T_1 = T_{1,\text{classical}} - T_{1,\text{relativistic}} = 1 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the classical \( T_1 \) is **10 MeV**.
