Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just subtract them normally because that would be incorrect in relativity. Oh right, I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²). But wait, no, that's when you have two frames moving relative to each other. But here, both are moving in the same direction. Oh wait, but the question is about the relative speed between the two astronauts. So from the perspective of one astronaut, what is the speed of the other?

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Because of the way relativity works, that's not the case. So I definitely need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but which astronaut's frame are we considering? Oh, wait, the relative speed is from one astronaut's frame to the other. So for instance, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "relative speed" between them. But I think in relativity, the relative velocity depends on which frame you're in. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the relative velocity between them using the relativistic formula.

So the formula for the relative velocity u' when you have two velocities u and v in the same direction is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Because if you're in a frame moving at velocity u, and another object is moving at v, then the relative velocity would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c²)), but I might have to double-check the signs.

Wait, let me think. Let's say astronaut A is moving at velocity v=0.6c in the positive x-direction, and astronaut B is moving at velocity u=0.5c in the same direction. From A's frame, what is B's velocity?

In classical mechanics, you'd subtract, so 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. That is, B is moving at -0.1c relative to A. But in relativity, it's more complicated.

The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So substituting u=0.5c and v=0.6c:

(0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/(c²))
