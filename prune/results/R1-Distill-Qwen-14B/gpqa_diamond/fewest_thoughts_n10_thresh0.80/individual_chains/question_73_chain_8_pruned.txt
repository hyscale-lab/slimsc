Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question says two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed? Oh right, in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like you do in classical mechanics. I remember the formula for adding velocities is different. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, no, actually, when you're finding the relative speed, you have to consider the frame of reference.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. I think we want to find the speed of one as seen from the other. Let's pick one as the frame of reference. Let's say, from astronaut A's frame, what's the speed of astronaut B?

Wait, no. Actually, if both are moving in the same direction, astronaut B is moving slower than astronaut A. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, no, correction. The relative velocity formula is used when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So if frame S' is moving at velocity u relative to S, then the velocity v' of an object in S' is (v - u) / (1 - (vu)/c²). 

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame. Astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. So, to find the relative speed of B from A's perspective, we can take v = 0.5c (B's speed in lab) and u = 0.6c (A's speed in lab). So, v' would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c is -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 -0.3 = 0.7. So v' = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142
