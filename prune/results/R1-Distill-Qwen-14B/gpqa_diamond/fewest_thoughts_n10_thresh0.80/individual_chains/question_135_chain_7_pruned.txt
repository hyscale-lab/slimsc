Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays. The question is about a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. I need to find out what particles it can decay into at the lowest order. Let me think through this.

First, the problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I misread that. Oh right, it's probably L = -λ ψ_f † (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like an interaction between the boson X and the fermions, specifically the fermion fields ψ_f. So the fermion type would determine the possible decay products.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. For a particle to decay into two particles, the combined mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So the center of mass energy must be sufficient. But wait, for each possible pair of fermions, their rest mass must be less than half of X's mass because each would get some kinetic energy, but the rest mass is the main factor.

So, X can decay into a pair of fermions, say f and f-bar. The key is to find which fermions have a rest mass less than 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. But wait, particles have mass, so each must be less than 3 GeV individually. But wait, for a pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the X mass. But since they are a pair (like e+ and e-), each has a mass m, so 2m < 6 GeV → m < 3 GeV. So each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV.

Let me list the known fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
Muon: ~0.105 GeV
Tau: ~1.78 GeV
Up quark: ~2.2 MeV (so about 0.0022 GeV)
Down quark: ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
Strange quark: ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
Charm quark: ~1.28 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
Top quark: ~173 GeV

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, which fermions are involved? The variable is ψ_f, so f could be any fermion, but the interaction is given. So the interaction term is λ ψ_f† (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So X couples directly to ψ_f. So the decay products would be into pairs of ψ_f and ψ_f-bar.

Therefore, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV. So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV?

Let's see:

Electron (0.0005): yes
Muon (0.105): yes
Tau (1.78): yes
Up quark (0.0022): yes
Down quark (0.0047): yes
Strange quark: 0.095 GeV → yes.

Charm quark is at 1.28 GeV → yes, since 1.28 < 3. So charm is okay.

But bottom quark is 4.5 GeV. Each would require 4.5 GeV for one quark, but X is 6 GeV. So 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So bottom quark is out.

Top quark is even heavier, so no.

Wait, but wait: the fermions
