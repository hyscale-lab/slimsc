Okay, I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. So first, I need to remember what SMEFT stands for. Oh right, it's the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. I think it's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at low energies, respecting the Standard Model symmetries but allowing for higher-dimensional operators which capture beyond the SM physics.

The question is about which symmetries are required for all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are A, B, C, D, each combining these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Poincare includes Lorentz as well as translations. So Lorentz is about rotations and boosts, and Poincare adds momentum translations. But in the context of field theories, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they have to respect Poincare symmetry?

Hmm, SMEFT is a Lorentz-covariant theory, so operators have to transform properly under Lorentz transformations. I think Poincare symmetry is automatically included because it's built into the framework, but the question is which symmetries must be "respected" by all operators. So perhaps all operators must be invariant under Lorentz transformations, but Poincare includes translations, which might not necessarily be a requirement for each operator, but the theory as a whole must be Poincare invariant.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. SMEFT is built in a way that respects the Poincare algebra. So all operators must be invariant under Poincare symmetry. Or wait, maybe operators are just constructed to be Lorentz scalars, and the theory as a whole has Poincare symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2 (Lorentz and Poincare). Option C is 1, 2, and 4. So do operators have to respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries?

I think that operators must be Lorentz scalars because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. But Poincare symmetry includes translations, which I think are also part of the framework. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, each individual operator would have to be a scalar under Lorentz and perhaps translations. But maybe individual operators don't need to respect translations because the terms are part of the Lagrangian, which is Poincare invariant.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be invariant under those symmetries.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry requires that each operator is a Lorentz scalar. Poincare symmetry would require that the operator is invariant under spacetime translations. But operators in the Lagrangian are part of the action, which is invariant under translations because the integral over spacetime is invariant.

Wait, each term in the Lagrangian density must be a scalar under Lorentz transformations. But for Poincare, which includes translations, the Lagrangian density must be a scalar, but each term doesn't have to separately be translation invariant because the integral as a whole is. Or perhaps it's the other way aroundâ€”each term must be a scalar, which includes being a scalar under Lorentz, but not necessarily translations. Because translation invariance is handled by the integral, not each term.

So perhaps each operator (term in the Lagrangian) must be a Lorentz scalar, but not necessarily invariant under translations. So operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare. Or maybe they do? I'm a bit uncertain here.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT framework is built such that all operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory, so each operator is a scalar under both Lorentz and translations. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: which of these symmetries are automatically respected by the SMEFT framework, meaning that operators must respect them. Let's think about each symmetry.

Lorentz symmetry: Yes. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must form Lorentz scalars.

Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. In a field theory, the Poincare symmetry is about the whole theory being invariant under these transformations. So the terms in the Lagrangian (the operators) must be scalars under Lorentz, but the Lagrangian as a whole must be invariant under translations. But individual operators aren't required to be translation-invariant because the integral handles that. So perhaps Poincare isn't something each operator must respect, but the theory as a whole does.

So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators, then Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must. Poincare (2) may not be required for each operator, only for the theory as a whole.

Wait, but perhaps the operators are constructed in such a way that they are Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily Poincare. So the correct answer would have Lorentz symmetry but not Poincare. Looking at the options:

Option A is 1 and 2. Option C includes
