Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with similar radius to the Sun. Half of one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, which makes the spots come into and out of view. The setup is similar to what an exoplanet transit would look like, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the star, that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do? So, I need to compare the dip in brightness caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how each of these affects the light curve.

First, when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) during transit is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet over the area of the star.

Now, looking at the star with spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, they contribute less light. The brightness variation would be due to the spots rotating into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation depends on the difference in brightness between the spotted and unspotted regions, and the area that is changing.

Wait, but how do I calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots? I think I need to compute the change in the star's total luminosity as the spots become visible.

The star's total flux without any spots would be based on its effective temperature. But with spots, part of its surface is at a lower temperature. The flux from the star would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

Let me think: the star's total flux (F_total) is F_unspotted + F_spotted.

The flux from the unspotted area is F_un = F_sun * (1 - filling factor), assuming the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered.

Wait, wait, the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R²) for a hemisphere, but since it's only one hemisphere, perhaps I should think in terms of the whole star.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Alternatively, the spotted area is 0.2 * (surface area of one hemisphere).

But when the star rotates, only part of the spotty hemisphere is visible. Wait, no—because it's one hemisphere that's spotty, when the star rotates, we see either
