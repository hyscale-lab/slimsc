Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by spots. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K? I guess that's right.

The problem says that because the star is spotted on only one hemisphere, when we observe it, the brightness changes as the star rotates—this is called rotational modulation. And this effect is similar to what we'd see if there were an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So the task is to find out what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same change in brightness as these spots do.

Wait, but the question says, "if the star was not covered by spots!" So I need to imagine that instead of the star having spots, there's an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation. So I have to calculate Rpl/Rstar such that the exoplanet's effect is the same as the spots' effect.

I remember that the brightness variation caused by a planet (like during transit) depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, the spots are not a planet—they're just dark regions on the star. So the change in brightness when the spots come into view as the star rotates would be different. I think the spot effect is due to the difference in brightness between the spotted and unspotted areas.

The star's total brightness without spots would be based on its effective temperature. But with spots, part of the surface is cooler, so when that part is facing us, the overall brightness drops.

Let me think about the flux from the star. The star's total flux (without spots) would be σTeff^4 multiplied by the surface area. But when spots are present, the flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The filling factor is 20%, so f = 0.2. The area of the spots is f times the total surface area of the star.

The flux from the star when the spots are on the hemisphere we see is: 

Flux = (1 - f) * σTeff^4 * (4πRstar²) / (4π) ) + f * σ(Teff - ΔT)^4 * (4πRstar²) / (4π)

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the fractional change in brightness when the spots are on the visible side.

The star's flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4 * (Rstar^2) * (1) [since the surface area is 4πR², but flux per unit area is σT^4, and the total flux is area times flux per area. But when calculating fractional brightness,
