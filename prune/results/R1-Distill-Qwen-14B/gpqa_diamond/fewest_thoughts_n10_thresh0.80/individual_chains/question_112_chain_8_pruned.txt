Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse through it step by step. Hmm... The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the setup. We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, wait. Proportional means it's not necessarily normalized. So I think I'll need to normalize this state first. Because probabilities depend on the state's normalization.

Wait, the states |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So that's the standard spin-up and spin-down states in the z-basis. That should make things a bit easier.

So the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, so maybe we can represent it as a vector in the z-basis. Let me write that down. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The coefficients are 1+i and 2-i. But since it's proportional, maybe we should find the normalization constant.

To normalize, I need to compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> and set it to 1. The inner product is (1-i)(2+i) + (2+i)(1-i), because when you take the conjugate transpose, the coefficients become (1-i) and (2+i) for the inner product.

Wait, no wait. Let's see. |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, so the conjugate transpose (bra) would be (1 - i)<up| + (2 + i)<down|. So when I compute <alpha|alpha>, it's the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, <up|up> = 1, <down|down> = 1, and <up|down> = 0. So <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2. Let me calculate each.

|1+i|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. And |2 - i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1 =5. So sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, no. Wait, the original state is proportional, so we can write |alpha> = C*(1+i)|up> + C*(2-i)|down>, where C is 1/sqrt(7), because when you take the inner product, you get |C|^2 (|1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2) which would be (1/7)(7) =1. So yes, that's correct.

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the operator whose matrix has elements A_ij. The matrix elements are given as A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix, since |up> and |down> are two states.

Let me write out the matrix. For a 2x2 case, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Wait, no. Because A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j. So for a 2x2, the diagonal (1,1) and (2,2) are zero, and the off-diagonal (1,2) and (2,1) are hbar/2.
