Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different brightness limits for the stars they can observe.

Let me start by recalling what each instrument can do. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. And HIRES can go down to V mag 16. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag can be seen by HIRES, and anything brighter than 17 by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait. Wait, magnitude works in reverseâ€”lower numbers are brighter. So a star with lower magnitude is brighter. So both instruments can see stars that are brighter than 16 mag, because 16 is less than 17. So a star that is magnitude 16 or lower can be seen by both. But a star with magnitude between 16 and 17 can only be seen by HIRES, not ESPRESSO. And anything brighter than 17 (like 16 or lower) can be seen by both.

Wait, no. Let me think. The question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means m_v < 17. Because 'brighter than' implies lower magnitude number. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, it's visible by ESPRESSO. For HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so m_v < 16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with an apparent V magnitude of 15 is brighter than one with 16, which is brighter than 17. So the observation limits for each instrument are:

ESPRESSO: m_v < 17 (can see stars brighter than 17, i.e., m_v up to 17, but anything dimmer is beyond their limit).

HIRES: m_v < 16 (can see up to 16, so anything dimmer than 16 is not observable).

So a star that is m_v = 16 is observable by both? Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, so m_v=1
