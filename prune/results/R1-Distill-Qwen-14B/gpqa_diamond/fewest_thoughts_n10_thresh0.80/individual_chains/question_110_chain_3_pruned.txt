Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, okay, I remember that these instruments have different magnitude limits, so I need to figure out which stars are bright enough for both.

Let me read the question again. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, actually, I think the wording is that they can be observed if the apparent V magnitude is brighter than a certain value. So, brighter means lower magnitude, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V < 17 can be observed. And HIRES can observe stars with V < 16.5 because it's brighter than 16 mag.

Wait, no, let me check. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Oh, wait, no, wait. The way it's phrased is a bit tricky. The question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. But in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's V magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than a 17 mag star. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag up to 17, but not brighter than that? Or wait, no, no. Wait, brightness is higher when magnitude is lower. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, the limit is stars with V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <16.5.

So, the stars that can be detected by both spectrographs must have apparent V magnitudes less than 16.5, because HIRES can't go beyond that. Wait, no, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So a star that is brighter than 17 (V <17) can be observed by ESPRESSO, but for both, it has to be brighter than both limits. Wait, no, because if a star has V=16, then it's below both 16.5 and 17, so it can be observed by both. But if a star is V=16.6, then it can't be seen by HIRES (since it's above 16.5), but ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.6 is below 17). So, to be detected by both, the star's V must be <16.5.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question says which stars can be detected with both. So, the star's apparent V must be less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16.5 (for HIRES). So, the stricter limit is 16.5. So the star's V must be less than 16.5.

But wait, looking at the options, the stars have either absolute magnitudes, or apparent magnitudes. So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star.

Let me
