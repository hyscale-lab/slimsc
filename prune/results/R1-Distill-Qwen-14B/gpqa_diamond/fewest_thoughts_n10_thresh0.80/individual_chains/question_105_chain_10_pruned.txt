Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is that when the star rotates, these spots come into view and then disappear, causing brightness variations. The question is, if instead of spots, we had an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would be the radius of the planet relative to the star?

Hmm. So, how do starspots cause photometric variations? Well, when spots are on the visible hemisphere, the star's total brightness decreases because the spots are cooler and emit less light. As the star rotates, the spots move into and out of view, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, a planet transiting in front of the star would block some of the starlight, causing a dip in brightness proportional to the area blocked.

The problem says that in this scenario, the photometric variations (due to the spots) can resemble those caused by an exoplanet. So, we need to find the planet's radius that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Wait, but the question says "if the star was not covered by spots!" So, the brightness variation caused by the planet would be similar to the variation caused by the spots in the given scenario. So, I need to calculate the relative change in brightness in both cases and equate them.

Let me think step by step.

First, when a planet transits the star, the change in brightness (ΔF) is given by the area blocked divided by the star's total area. So, ΔF_planet = (R_planet^2) / (R_star^2).

Now, for the star spots: when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. The brightness change depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

Wait, the effective temperature is 6000K for the star, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so T_spot = 5000K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So, the spots cover 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, the star emits light as a blackbody. The total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR_star^2 * σ * Teff^4.

But when spots are present, the total luminosity changes. The spots are cooler, so their contribution is less.

But wait, the star emits from its entire surface, so when only one hemisphere is spotted, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas.

But when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, so the photometric observations see the brightness dip when the spots are on the side facing us.

Wait, no. Actually, the star's rotation makes the spots come into and go out of view. The brightness variations are periodic as the spots rotate into and out of the observed hemisphere.

Wait, but each hemisphere has a certain area
