Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. I'll take it step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a diamond-shaped molecule. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms attached to adjacent carbons in this structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. From the NMR and IR data, I need to figure out what product 1 is.

The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, product 1 likely has a ketone group. The NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). 

Wait, when dibromides react with KOH, they usually undergo elimination or substitution. But since both bromines are on adjacent carbons, maybe it's an E2 elimination. But wait, if we have two bromines on adjacent carbons, perhaps it's a di-elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but considering the IR shows a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, let's think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with KOH could lead to an elimination reaction where each Br is removed, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. But wait, connecting that, two eliminations would form a ketone? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but that might not fit with the IR data.

Wait, another possibility: maybe a cleavage reaction. For example, treatment with strong base like KOH could cause the cleavage of the C-Br bonds, especially vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Brs) when treated with strong base can undergo elimination to form alkenes, but if the base is very strong, maybe it goes further.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. So, the product must have a C=O group. So perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the formation of a ketone via elimination. For example, in vicinal dihalides, heating with strong bases can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh wait, I'm trying to recall: when 1,2-dibromoalkanes are treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes they can eliminate to form a ketone. Wait, no, usually elimination leads to alkenes. But in certain cases, especially when the structure allows, maybe a ketone is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, each Br is removed, and the two carbons that were attached to Brs become carbonyl groups. But that would require two carbonyls, which doesn't fit the IR data (only one strong peak). Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. If KOH is in excess, maybe each Br is replaced by OH groups. So, substitution would give 1,3-diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be right.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a cleavage of the adamantane structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, and 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgehead carbons. Perhaps when heated with KOH, the molecule breaks down. Wait, but the product is a solid, so maybe it's a ring-opening.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the NMR data. The product 1 has an NMR peak at 4.79 ppm, integrating for 2H. That's a region typical for a CH₂ group attached to an electronegative group, like oxygen. For example, an alcohol or an ether, but considering the IR has a carbonyl, perhaps it's a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

The 2.41-2.23 ppm region is for 10H. That's a lot of protons. Adamantane has a lot of CH groups, so perhaps those are from the structure.

The 1.94 ppm is for 2H. Maybe another CH₂ group.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination would lose two HBr molecules. So, perhaps it forms a double bond. But then IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution, but that's unlikely for two bromines adjacent to each other without an appropriate leaving group.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by a ketone group. But that would require each C-Br to become a C=O, which would require two ketone groups. But the IR shows a single peak at 1720, which could be a ketone. So maybe only one of the Br is converted.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Brs, so perhaps both are eliminated. Wait, but that would form a double bond, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a peroxide effect elimination, but that's usually for forming alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Fittig reaction, but Fittig is for coupling aryl halides, which isn't applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, and the structure rearranges to form a ketone. Let me think about the possible structure.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the product after KOH. The IR has a C=O, so product 1 is a ketone.

Looking at the options, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone? But that would require two ketone groups, which might not fit the IR as a single peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridged structure with one ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would lead to a diol, and the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction forms an epoxide. But that would require an oxygen bridge, and the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So no.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is 2H. Maybe it's a CH₂ connected to an O, like an ether or an alcohol. But the IR has a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a ketone with a CH₂ group next to it.

Wait, let's think about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid, which is a polycyclic structure. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe the Brs are replaced by something else. But how?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but in a way that forms a ketone. Wait, another reaction: the formation of a ketone from a dihalide via a base. Oh! Wait, maybe the base causes an elimination to form an alkene,
