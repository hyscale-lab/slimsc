Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see. The problem is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system. The given operator is P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the operator. Oh right, the operator P is a vector operator, so it's related to angular momentum. Since the components are given, I can construct the operator along the direction n. The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because the y-component is zero. Wait, no, actually, since it's in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, because in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or 180 degrees, so maybe just θ. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the direction as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

But the operator in question is P, which is analogous to angular momentum. Oh wait, wait. The operator P is actually given as components. The problem states that each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) is given as ħ/2 times a matrix. So each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a specific 2x2 matrix.

I think the operator P is a spin-1/2 operator because the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So, this is similar to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So the general operator along direction n is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n is a unit vector,
