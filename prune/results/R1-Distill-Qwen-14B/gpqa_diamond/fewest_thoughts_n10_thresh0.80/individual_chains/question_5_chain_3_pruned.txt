Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the eigenvector of an operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states with definite values.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I think the operator P is a vector operator, meaning P = Px x-hat + Py y-hat + Pz z-hat. But wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the operator along direction n would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z, right?

But wait, the question says n is in the x-z plane. That means the y-component of n is zero. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait no, wait. Actually, any direction in the x-z plane would have n_y=0. So the operator along n would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero.

Wait, but the operator P is a vector, P = (Px, Py, Pz), so when you project along n, it's the sum over i (n_i P_i). So in this case, since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0, so P_n = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

But the question asks for the eigenvector of P along n. So the operator is P·n hat, which is n_x Px + n_z Pz. Because n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the operator P is along n, or are we taking the components of P and combining them according to n? I think it's the latter. So the operator we're interested in is P_n = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

We're looking for an eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So first, I need to construct the matrix for P_n. Let's see. The components are:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P_n = (n_x * (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me compute this matrix. Let me factor out (ħ/2):

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ]

Wait, let me verify:

The (1,1) element is n_z * (1) + n_x * (0) = n_z * (1) from Pz. Wait no, wait:

Wait, no, the matrix for Px is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you multiply by n_x, it's [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]]. The matrix for Pz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by n_z, so [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding these together, the (1,1) element is n_z, the (1,2) is n_x, the (2,1) is n_x, and (2,2) is -n_z. So P_n matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [ a; b ]

Cancel out (ħ/2) from both sides:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the equations are:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me write them:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Hmm, perhaps another approach is to write the
