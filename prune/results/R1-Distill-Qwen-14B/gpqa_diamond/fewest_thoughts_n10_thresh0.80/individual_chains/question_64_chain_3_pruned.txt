Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. Only a mixture of gases is formed, which is then passed through three tubes. Let's see what each tube does.

Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent. It probably absorbs water. So any water vapor in the gas mixture would be absorbed here, increasing the tube's weight by 3.60 grams. So that suggests the gas mixture has water vapor, and the amount is 3.60 g.

Tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution. Wait, but the weight of tube 2 didn't change. If the gas passed through it didn't react, that means there were no acidic gases like CO2 or SO2, because Ca(OH)2 would react with them. Or maybe the gas wasn't acidic. Alternatively, maybe the gas was just H2O and something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and they mention CuO formed. Red-hot copper in a gas would typically react with H2 (producing H2O and CuO), or maybe CO (would produce CO2 and CuO). Wait, so if the gas is CO, then passing it over hot Cu would produce CO2 and CuO. Alternatively, if it's H2, it would produce H2O (as vapor) and CuO. But since after tube 1, the gas would have lost water, but wait, the initial gas mixture after heating included H2O, which was absorbed in tube 1. So if there's any H2, it would have reacted with Cu, but maybe the tube is red-hot, so H2 would react. Let's think.

So, tube 3's weight gain is 0.80 g. Since CuO is formed, maybe the gas was CO. Because CO + Cu (hot) → CuO + CO2. Wait, but I'm not sure about the reaction specifics. Alternatively, if it's H2, then H2 + Cu → Cu + H2? No, wait, that's decomposition. Or, in the presence of O2, H2 could form H2O, but O2 might not be present here. Hmm.

Wait, but when the gas passes through tube 3, the weight increases by 0.80 grams, which is the mass of the product formed. So if it's H2 reacting with Cu, it might form H2O. But the mass would depend on the moles. Let's think about the possible reactions.

If gas is CO, then:

CO + Cu (hot) → CuO + CO2.

That reaction doesn't produce any mass change because both CO and CuO are involved. Wait, no, the mass of the tube would increase by the mass of CuO formed. Let me compute. Let's say the gas is CO. Let’s assume x moles of CO react.

Reaction: CO +
