Okay, I need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this problem involves multiple reactants, so it's a bit more complex.

First, I should look at each solution and figure out what's happening when they're mixed. The solutions are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, when you mix acids and bases, a neutralization reaction occurs, but I need to determine the limiting reactant because that will affect how much reaction actually happens.

Let me break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate moles of each acid and base.**
   - HCl is a strong acid. So, each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
   - H2SO4 is also a strong acid, and it's diprotic. So, each mole gives two moles of H+.
   - Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So, I need to find the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Calculating moles:
- HCl: volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is H+ per mole, H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.
- H2SO4: volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09. Each mole gives 2 H+, so H+ is 0.18 moles.
- Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, so total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.
Total OH- from base: 0.2 moles.

2. **Determine which is the limiting reactant.**
   The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. For each mole of H+ and OH- consumed, one mole of water is formed.

So, the H+ available is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. OH- is the limiting here because there's less OH- than H+.

So OH- will all react, and some H+ will remain unreacted.

3. **Calculate the moles of water formed.**
   Since OH- is limiting, moles of H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait another thing. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it can donate two H+ ions. But when it reacts with a base, each H+ reacts with an OH- to make water. So in this case, the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 moles. So, in the reaction, 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

But wait, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So, the 0.2 moles of OH- will take H+ from both acids.

So, the H+ used is 0.2 moles, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unused (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.
