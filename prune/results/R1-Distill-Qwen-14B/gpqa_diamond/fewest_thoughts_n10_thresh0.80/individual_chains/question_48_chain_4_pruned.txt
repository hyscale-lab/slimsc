Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So the structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone group, which is a carbonyl (C=O) attached to two CH2 groups.

The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine (Br2), forming product 1. Hmm, adding bromine to a ketone. Wait, I think when a ketone reacts with bromine, it might undergo a dibromination. Or wait, no, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, no, I'm thinking about the possibility of an enolate formation or perhaps an addition across the carbonyl. Wait, another thought: bromine can add to double bonds through an electrophilic addition. But wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, but wait a moment, ketones can undergo some kind of enol formation. Oh, right! When a ketone is treated with a halogen like bromine in a basic condition, it can undergo a haloform reaction, but wait, that's when it's treated with X2 and a base, like NaOH. But in this case, the first step is just Br2. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but I think that's for dienes and dienophiles.

Wait, another possibility: when a ketone is treated with bromine, perhaps it could undergo the benzoin condensation, but that requires a catalyst and is more for forming a new carbon-carbon bond, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that involves vicinal diols, so maybe not.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Adding Br2 in a non-polar solvent might cause an addition reaction. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, wait a second! Maybe I'm confusing this with the addition of bromine to alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the halohydrin formation. But wait, that requires a catalyst like H2SO4, I think, and would add a Br and an OH across the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diels-alder, but I don't see a diene here.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a bromohydrin. So, adding HBr and HOBr? No, wait, but the reagent is just Br2. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination at the alpha position. Oh wait, that's possible through the enol mechanism. So cyclohexanone can form an enol under certain conditions, which is then attacked by bromine. So the alpha position (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) would get brominated.

Wait, but when you treat a ketone with Br2 and maybe a base, you can get the formation of a bromoketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a dibromide via the enol mechanism.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. The enol form of a ketone can react with Br2. The enol has a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons. So Br2 would add across the double bond. That would add two bromine atoms, one on each carbon. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone? Or wait, 1,2-dibromo with the ketone.

So, the initial product after adding Br2 would have two Br atoms on the adjacent carbons (alpha and beta). So the structure would have the carbonyl group and then two adjacent Br atoms.

Next step: product 1 is heated with NaOH to form product 2. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Heating with sodium hydroxideâ€”what reaction could that be? Well, NaOH is a base, but also a good nucleophile.

Wait, 1,2-dihalides (vicinal dihalides) when treated with base can undergo elimination. For example, the
