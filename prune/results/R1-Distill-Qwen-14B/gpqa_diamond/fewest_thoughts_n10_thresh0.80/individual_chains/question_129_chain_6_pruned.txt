Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully and note down all the details.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. I need to figure out what E is based on the reaction steps and the given hints.

First, let's outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are four different ketones, so I'm guessing E is a ketone.

Let me break down each step.

Starting with compound A reacting with HCN to form B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups, like in a ketone or aldehyde, to form a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an ester or something else, but the IR peak at 1750 suggests a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester. But since B is formed from A and HCN, which is a nucleophilic addition, I think A is a ketone. So A is a cyclic ketone, perhaps. Then, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol with a cyano group. Wait, no, HCN adds to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN attached. So for example, cyclohexanone would add HCN to form a cyanohydrin, which is a cyclohexanol derivative with CN on the adjacent carbon.

But wait, maybe I should look at the hints. Hint a) says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides.

So if A reacts with a ylide to form an alkene, that suggests that A has a carbonyl group. The product of the Wittig is an alkene. The structure given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure in my mind. It's a cyclopentane ring. Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups each. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is the same as a methylene (CH2) group attached to a cyclopropane? Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part, perhaps a CH2-C- group? Wait, propan-2-ylidene is a group like CH2-C(CH3)=, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent where a double bond is formed.

Wait, the product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group. A's structure must have a carbonyl. So when A (with a carbonyl) reacts with a Wittig reagent (ylide), it forms an alkene.

Looking at the product: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=, but
