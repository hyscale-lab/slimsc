Okay, I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets in a system. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature has to do with the energy balance between the incoming starlight and the planet's outgoing radiation. Oh right, the formula I think is something like T = (L / (16 * π² * σ * D²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe the simplified version is more applicable here.

Wait, the planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in a ratio. The periods are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. Since they're in resonance, their orbits are in a specific ratio that's usually a ratio of integers. But how does that affect their equilibrium temperature?

The problem states that all planets have the same albedo. Oh, right, albedo is the reflectivity, so if they're the same, that component cancels out when comparing their temperatures. Thus, the temperature ratio will depend only on their distances from the star.

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2), where a is the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, another way to write it is that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (since a is the distance from the star). So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).

But since
