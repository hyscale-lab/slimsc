Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mice. Let's go through the problem step by step.

Alright, the setup: The researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress GADD45G. To do this, they're using a plasmid that's been modified to include the coding sequence for GADD45G with an added hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and found a specific issue.

The options given are A to D, each suggesting a different reason for the failure. Let's analyze each possibility.

First, looking at the construct's sequence provided. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's correct. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be at the beginning. Let me think about how the HA tag is added—usually, this would be via a peptide sequence added to the coding region. If it's inserted correctly, the mRNA should include the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G sequence.

But what could be wrong? The options suggest possible issues with the coding sequence. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Missense mutation in the HA sequence. If the HA tag has a mutation, that could cause issues with protein folding or recognition, but it might not necessarily prevent expression. Though, if the mutation is in the HA sequence, perhaps the protein is expressed but not detected because the antibody doesn't recognize it. But the problem states that they couldn't overexpress, so maybe it's more about the protein not being made. Hmm.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. If the mRNA has a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) somewhere before the end, the ribosome would terminate early. Let me look at the sequence for any early stop codons. Let's scan the sequence for any in-frame stop codons.

The sequence is in the plus strand, so the coding is from ATG to the end. Let me parse through some regions. Let's look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets because those are stop codons in the mRNA. Remember, the DNA sequence is complementary to the mRNA, so the mRNA is the non-template strand. Wait, wait—the construct's plus strand is the same as the mRNA? Or is it the opposite? No, wait. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA, because DNA has two strands, and the mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the template strand (which is the minus strand). So in the construct, the plus strand would have the coding sequence in the same direction as the mRNA.

So if the DNA plus strand has a TAA triplet, that would correspond to the mRNA having UAA, which is a stop codon. Are there any such triplets in the provided sequence?

Looking through the sequence, let me scan for TAA or TAG or TGA in the DNA. Let's look for any triplet:

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAT AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCG CGG CGC AGC TGG CTC GCA CTA CGG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAT TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GTG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC T TGG AGA AGC TCA GCC TGT TTT GCG AGG AGA GCC GCG GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, let me look for TGA in the DNA, which would lead to TAG in mRNA, which is a stop codon. Let me scan for TGA.

Looking through the sequence, I see ... GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA ...

Wait, there's a part that says ...TGA... towards the end. Let me look:

Focusing on the end of the sequence: ...GCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Ah, the last part is ...GAGTGA, which would be the DNA sequence. So the last codons would be TGA, because the DNA's plus strand has TGA. Wait, but DNA is double-stranded. Let me think again.

The construct's plus strand ends with ...GAGTGA. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, right? Because the mRNA is synthesized based on the template (minus) strand, which is complementary to the plus strand. So if the plus strand has CTT (for example), the mRNA would have GAA. Wait, no, wait: DNA is double-stranded. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA, but the minus strand is the template.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think more carefully.

In the DNA, the coding strand (plus) is the same as the mRNA, except T for U. So the mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the template (minus) strand. So the mRNA sequence would be same as the plus strand, except T becomes U.

So in the DNA, if the plus strand has a TGA triplet, that would correspond to the mRNA having UGA, which is a stop codon. Since the sequence provided ends with ...GAGTGA, which in DNA is the plus strand, that's GAG TGA. Wait, but the last part is 'AGTGA3'—so the last few nucleotides are ...AGTGA.

Wait, the very end is 'GAGTGA3' so that's the last part. So G-A-G-T-G-A. So the last codon is AGA in the plus strand because each codon is read as three bases. Wait, maybe I should split the sequence into codons to check.

But perhaps I should look for any TGA triplet in the DNA. Let me go through the sequence.

Looking for any T-G-A triplet in the plus strand.

Looking at the part: ...GGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Looking for TGA in the DNA:

Ah, here it is: ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Wait, I'm seeing a part where it's ...GCGAGTGA... that is G-C-G-A-G-T-G-A. Let me check if TGA appears.

Wait, perhaps the sequence has 'TGA' in the DNA. Let me look again.

Wait, I think I see a TGA near the end. The last part is 'GAGTGA3' — so the last codons are GAG, TGA. So DNA has GAG TGA. Which would, in mRNA, be GAG UGA. So the mRNA would have a UGA codon, which is a stop codon. Oh wait, because in the DNA's plus strand, TGA is a stop codon in the mRNA.

So the presence of TGA in the plus strand of the DNA would introduce a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early. That would lead to a truncated protein or no protein at all, depending on when the stop occurs.

If that's the case, the construct is introducing a premature stop codon in the coding sequence. So the ribosome would read the mRNA, hit the UGA (stop codon), and terminate early. That would prevent the full-length protein from being expressed.

So looking back at the options, option B says: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would fit. Because the mRNA has a UGA (from the TGA in DNA), which is a stop codon, leading to early termination.

Alternatively, another option is option C: The lack of linker is causing proteolysis. But the question is about overexpression. If the protein is being made but rapidly degraded, then the steady-state levels might be low. But the problem says the mice couldn't overexpress, so maybe the construct isn't producing protein at all. But if the construct has a premature stop codon, then the protein isn't made beyond that point.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the stop codon is after the HA, then the HA would be present but the rest of the protein might not be. But in the given sequence, the stop codon is at the end. Wait, no, the construct ends with TGA. So the stop codon is at the end, which would mean the full coding sequence is present. But wait, wait—the DNA ends with TGA. So the mRNA would end with UGA, which is a stop codon. So the protein should terminate correctly. But wait, that's the normal stop codon. So it's not a premature stop codon.

Wait a minute, that's confusing. So the construct's coding sequence ends with TGA, which is the stop codon. So that's normal. So why would the ribosome terminate early? Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should check for any in-frame stop codons before the end. Let me go back.

Let me parse the DNA sequence into codons, starting from the ATG. Let me write out the first few parts:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAT AGT TCC GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCG CGG CGC AGC TGG CTC GCA CTA CGG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA...

Wait, looking at the first part: TAC is Tyr, then CCC is Pro, ATA is Ile, etc. But looking for any TGA triplet.

Wait, the first stop codon is at the very end. So the mRNA goes all the way to the TGA and stops normally. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. The end of the DNA is ...GAGTGA. So the last codon would be GAG (Glu), then TGA. Oh wait, wait, in the DNA, the plus strand's last codon is TGA. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So that's the normal termination. So why would that cause a problem?

Hmm. Now I'm a bit confused. Because if the stop codon is correctly placed at the end, the construct should produce the full-length protein. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Let me think about other possibilities. The HA tag is at the N-terminus. If the HA tag is not correctly added, that might prevent detection, but the problem says the overexpression isn't happening. So maybe the construct isn't being transcribed or translated.

Wait, perhaps the issue is a frameshift or a premature stop codon earlier in the sequence. So let me scan the entire sequence for any in-frame stop codons (UGA, UAG, UAA in the mRNA).

So looking at the DNA's plus strand and converting to mRNA by replacing T with U:
