Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are not superimposable on their mirror images, right? Which means they have chiral centers. So the question is asking which of the given moieties show optical isomerism.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. So it's a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate ester groups. Oh, wait, the rings are connected in such a way that there might be a possibility of planar chirality. Like, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetric. Because if the substituents are in such positions that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers. So for biphenyls, if the substituents are in a way that the two rings can't be mirrored, then there's a chance for optical isomerism. So I think this one might show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure. Propanoate ester with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the carbon chain is: OMe-O-C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate would be CH3CH2COO- as the ester. Wait, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxy on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2OH-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait: the ester is methyl, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3-COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Hydroxypropanoate would be HOOC-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think: propanoate is three carbons. The formula is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but is that correct? So the molecule is: OMe-O-C-O-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Oh wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOOCCH2COOCH3, but that's not right either. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as the anion
