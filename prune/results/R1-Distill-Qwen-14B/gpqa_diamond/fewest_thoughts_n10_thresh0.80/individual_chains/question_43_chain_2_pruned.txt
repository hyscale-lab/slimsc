Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents. The question is about determining the correct IUPAC name from the given options. Hmm, I remember that IUPAC naming for aromatic compounds involves numbering the substituents in such a way that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers.

Let me try to visualize the structure. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde group, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Wait, meta means they are separated by two carbons, right? So, if I imagine the benzene ring, these three groups are each positioned at 1, 3, 5 positions or something like that.

Wait, no. Actually, meta is two positions apart. So, for a benzene ring, substituents that are meta to each other are in positions 1, 3, 5 relative to each other if they are all meta.

Wait, but the question says all meta to one another. So, each pair is meta. That would mean they are at 1, 3, 5 positions. Because each is separated by two positions. For example, if one is at position 1, the next meta would be at 3, and the third meta would be at 5. So, positions 1, 3, 5 are all meta to each other.

So, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid (let's say at position 1), a carbaldehyde (position 3), and a cyano group
