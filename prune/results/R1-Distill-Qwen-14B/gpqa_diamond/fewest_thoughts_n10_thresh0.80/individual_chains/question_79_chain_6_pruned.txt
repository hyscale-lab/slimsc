Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again and think step by step.

The question is about an experiment where compound X (C11H12O) is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. They give the NMR spectra of the product, and I need to identify what compound X was from the options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is commonly known as DBU, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So, when DBU is used in such reactions, it's often involved in elimination or deprotonation steps, maybe epoxidation or something similar. Wait, or perhaps it's used in the context of forming an epoxide from a diene? Or maybe it's part of a ring-opening or ring-closing reaction.

Looking at the molecular formula of compound X: C11H12O. The product has the same formula? Because the reaction is with DBU, which is a base, and maybe it's an elimination. So if X is something like an epoxide, and DBU is causing a ring-opening or perhaps deprotonation, but I'm not certain yet.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are at Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). 

So I see two singlet triplets at around 2.28 and 2.31, each integrating to 3H. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them, like maybe an aromatic ring or a carbonyl. Or perhaps they're CH3 groups attached to electronegative atoms or in a symmetrical environment.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). Wait, so maybe two doublets in the aromatic region. Let me think about possible coupling patterns. If it's a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be a doublet, but here I see two doublets, each integrating to 1H and 2H. Hmm.

Wait, the 13C NMR: 21.3 (s, 1C), 28.4 (s, 1C), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).
