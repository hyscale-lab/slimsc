Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is coming towards them at that speed. I think this means that the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy in the opposite direction, right? Because if the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, the ejecta must be moving towards the Galaxy in the opposite frame.

The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so time is different in different frames because of relativity. I remember that time dilation comes into play when frames are moving relative to each other. Oh wait, but wait, this is probably a classical mechanics problem because the options are large distances, and maybe the speeds involved aren't close to the speed of light. Let me check: 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% the speed of light, which is significant. So maybe I need to consider relativity here.

Wait, but the problem mentions that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So we can't just use Galilean transformations; we need to use the Lorentz transformations. Because when you have high speeds like a significant fraction of the speed of light, Galilean velocity addition isn't accurate. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame depends on how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame, which is different from the ejecta's frame due to time dilation.

So first, I need to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Then, using the time in the Galaxy's frame, multiply by the ejecta's speed as seen from the Galaxy to get the distance.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me get the setup right. Let me denote the Galaxy
