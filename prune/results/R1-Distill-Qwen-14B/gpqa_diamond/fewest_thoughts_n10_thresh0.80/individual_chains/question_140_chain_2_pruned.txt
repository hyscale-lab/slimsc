Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Let me break this down. First, I'll try to identify what each substance is.

Starting with the reaction: X reacts violently with liquid Y. Common violent reactions might be acid-base reactions or redox reactions. If Y is a liquid, maybe it's water? Or something else, like an acid. Wait, another thought: sodium reacts violently with water, producing hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide, which can precipitate as a solid.

Wait, but the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So W's molecule has the same number of p and n. Let's think: H2O has H (1,0) and O (8,8), but wait, H2O isn't a molecule where the total protons and neutrons are equal. Wait, wait, the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons. So let me think: the molecular formula of W would have total protons equal to total neutrons.

Which gas fits this? Let's think of simple gases. For example, H2 is possible. Hydrogen gas. But H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons per molecule. Wait, but in H2, each H has 1 p and 0 n. So for H2, total protons are 2, total neutrons 0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Another option: CO2? Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's CO? No, because CO's structure is different. Wait, perhaps the gas is CO2? Wait, CO2 is a molecule, but let's check. Wait, CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and O (8
