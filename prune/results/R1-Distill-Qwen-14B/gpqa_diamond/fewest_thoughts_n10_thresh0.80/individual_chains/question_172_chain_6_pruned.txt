Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the visible part of a star, right? And when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2, I think that refers to the population of a specific energy level. Oh wait, excitation energy usually relates to the energy levels in atoms, so maybe the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, that's a small number, so maybe it's related to thermal energy. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium, which fits with LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) as stated.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant. So the formula is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). But wait, if E2 is higher than E1, then E2 - E1 is positive, so the exponent becomes negative, making the ratio less than one, which makes sense because lower energy states are more populated.

In the problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So I think that means the population ratio for star_1 (n1) is twice that of star_2 (n2). Wait, no. Let me think again. If the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, that would mean more atoms are in the higher energy level compared to the lower one. So maybe for star_1, the ratio is higher. Let me clarify. Let's say the two energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. The excitation here refers to the higher energy level. So, the population of E2 compared to E1.

Wait, actually, the question says the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Or maybe the relative excitation is higher. Wait, perhaps it's the ratio n_upper/n_lower. So for star_1, n_upper1/n_lower1 = 2 *
