Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms relates to the temperature. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states based on temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to a term involving the exponential of the energy difference over kT. So the formula is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Wait, or is it (E1-E2)? I think E2 is higher than E1 if it's an excited state. So if star 1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level, that means the population of that higher energy level is twice as much in star 1 compared to star 2.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. That's a specific value, but maybe it's a given so we don't have to plug it into the equations directly. The question is about finding the relation between their temperatures, T1 and T2.

So let's denote the energy levels. Let's say level 1 is the lower energy, level 2 is higher. So for star 1, the population in level 2 is n2_1, and for star 2, it's n2_2. The problem says n2_1 = 2 * n2_2.

But wait, actually, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation refers to the number in the excited state. So for each atom, the probability of being in an excited state is higher in star_1.

So using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star 1: n2_1 / n1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
Similarly, for star 2: n2_2 / n1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Assuming that the total number of atoms in both levels is the same in each star, which I think is a common assumption when dealing with photosphere conditions in LTE. So n1 + n2 is constant, but for comparing between stars, perhaps n1_1 and n1_2 are different.

Wait, but maybe it's better to take the ratio of the two ratios. So the ratio (n2_1 / n1_1) divided by (n2_2 / n1_2) would be [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ].

Which simplifies to exp( [ ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ] ). Because -ΔE/(k T1) plus ΔE/(k T2) is ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1), but wait, I'm getting the signs a bit mixed here. Let me double-check.

Wait, the expression for star 1 is n2_1/n
