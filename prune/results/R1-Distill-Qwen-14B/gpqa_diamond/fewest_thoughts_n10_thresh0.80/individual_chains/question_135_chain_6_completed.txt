Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ fψ̄ f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is describing an interaction where the boson X couples to fermions.

Wait, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a particle to decay into another pair, the energy (or mass) of the parent must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. That's the basic rule for kinematic decay feasibility.

So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of X is at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. So I need to list all possible fermion pairs where 2*m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's list the masses of the known fermions. The charged leptons are electrons, muons, taus. The quarks include up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Wait, but top quarks are super heavy, about 173 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks since 2*173 is way more than 6 GeV.

So for each fermion, I'll check if 2*m_f ≤6 GeV.

Electron: mass ~0.0005 GeV. So 2*0.0005 is 0.001 GeV. That's way under 6, so e+ e- is allowed.

Muon: about 0.105 GeV. 2*0.105 is 0.21 GeV. Also allowed.

Tau: about 1.777 GeV. 2*1.777 is 3.554 GeV. Which is less than 6, so tau+ tau- is allowed.

Now quarks. Let's think about their masses. The masses can vary, but commonly, the up and down quarks are considered light, maybe around a few MeV each. So 2*(up) would be negligible, definitely allowed.

Strange quark: about 100 MeV, so 2*0.1 GeV = 0.2 GeV, way under 6.

Charm quark: about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5 =3 GeV. Under 6, so charm-anticharm allowed.

Bottom quark: about 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5=9 GeV. Oh, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b anti-b because 9 >6. So that's not allowed.

Wait, but wait! Some sources might give different masses. For example, the bottom quark mass is about 4.1 to 4.7 GeV. Wait, if I take m_b as around 4.5 GeV, then 2*m_b is around 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So decay into b bbar is not allowed.

But wait, the problem gives m_X=6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks.

So which fermions can X decay into? Let me list the possible ones:

Electrons (e+ e-): allowed.

Muons (mu+ mu-): allowed.

Taus (tau+ tau-): allowed.

Quark pairs:

u anti-u: allowed.

d anti-d: allowed.

s anti-s: allowed.

c anti-c: allowed.

But not b anti-b or t anti-t.

So looking at the options:

Option A) X → b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b bbar is not allowed because 2*m_b >6 GeV. So A includes b, which is wrong.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but option B includes c cbar. Since m_c ~1.5 GeV, 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6. So yes, allowed.

Wait, but what about the tau? Yes, tau is allowed.

So B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But does the Lagrangian allow all these fermions?

Wait, looking back at the Lagrangian: the interaction is written as λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the index f might represent the fermion type. So X can interact with any fermion that has charge f. Wait, the notation is a bit unclear. Wait, the term is written as -lambda f psi_bar f(y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Wait, maybe the 'f' is a flavor index. So the interaction terms are for all fermions f. So X couples to all possible fermion species, meaning that in principle, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass condition is satisfied.

So looking back, the possible decay products are any fermion with m_f such that 2 m_f ≤6 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV?

Well, let's list the fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV.

Mu: ~0.105.

Tau: ~1.777.

Up: ~2 MeV (0.002 GeV).

Down: ~4 MeV.

Strange: ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV).

Charm: ~1.25 to 1.5 GeV.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV.

Top: ~173 GeV.

So, fermions with m_f ≤3 GeV:

All except bottom and top.

Wait, but wait, 2*m_t is way over 6 GeV.

So X can decay into any of the following fermion pairs: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

But what about the quarks? Because if X is a boson, like a gauge boson, it can couple to charged fermions. But the interaction term given is with fermion fields, so as long as the mass is sufficient, the decay is allowed.

So the possible decays are into all these pairs except b and t.

Now looking at the options:

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

So that includes all allowed fermions except b and t. So that's correct.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d d bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But b bbar is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, what about the c quark? m_c is around 1.2-1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5 is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c cbar is allowed, so option B includes it.

But option B doesn't include t, which is fine. So the allowed decays are the ones in option B and D, but D includes b which is not allowed.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, which is allowed. So B is correct.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so C is wrong.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing: the interaction Lagrangian given is for fermions, but do all fermions have the same coupling strength? The problem doesn't specify, so I can assume that X can decay into any fermion that satisfies the mass condition.

So the allowed decay modes are all the pairs where 2 m_f ≤6 GeV. So which options fit that.

Looking back:

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

Yes, all these have 2 m_f ≤6 GeV.

Option D has b, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Correct.
