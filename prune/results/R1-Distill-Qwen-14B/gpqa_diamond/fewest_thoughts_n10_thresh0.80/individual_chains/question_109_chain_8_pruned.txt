Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't permitted when two nucleons in a 1S0 state emit a particle X. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the initial state is 1S0. The notation is a bit tricky, but I think it's in the form (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S must be 0, L is 0, and J is also 0. Wait, because 2*0+1 is 1, so yeah, 1S0 means S=0, L=0, J=0. That makes sense because S is the total spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and J is total angular momentum.

The problem says that the two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Oh right, intrinsic parity is about the particle's properties. So X has parity -1.

Pauli statistics require that the final NN state satisfies T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Oh, and in this case, the final state has T=0. So substituting, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That gives S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parities. One is even, the other odd.

Now, the question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are different transitions, each involving a particle (like p, s, f) and a specific partial wave state.

I think I need to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity here. So the initial state has certain quantum numbers, and the final state must match in terms of parity and angular momentum.

Let me recall: the total parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of each particle and the orbital angular momentum part. The orbital part contributes (-1)^L, right? Because parity changes with L, so even L contributes +1, odd L -1. But each particle's intrinsic parity is also a factor. Since it's a two-body system, the parity is the product of their intrinsic parities and the orbital part.

Wait, but the initial state is the NN
