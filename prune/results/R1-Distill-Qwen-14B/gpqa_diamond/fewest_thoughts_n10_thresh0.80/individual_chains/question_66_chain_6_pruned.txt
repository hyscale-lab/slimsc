Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries, and I need to choose the correct combination from the options provided.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, and their effects are suppressed by some high energy scale, usually denoted as Λ.

Now, about symmetries. Symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the laws of nature and the interactions between particles. The Standard Model respects several symmetries, and I think the SMEFT should preserve these as well, unless there's a specific reason for breaking them.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option 1 is Lorentz Symmetry. I recall that Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance of physical laws under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so any effective theory like SMEFT should also respect it. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is correct.

Option 2 is Poincaré symmetry. Wait, Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translations. So, if Lorentz symmetry is already required, does Poincaré symmetry also have to be respected? I think that SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must automatically respect Poincaré symmetry because it includes translations. But wait, does SMEFT consider all possible frames and translations? Well, the SMEFT is formulated in a way that it's a low-energy effective theory, so it's built upon the Standard Model which is Lorentz and Poincaré symmetric. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. So 2 is also correct.

Option 3 is CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Charge conjugation changes a particle into its antiparticle, and parity is spatial inversion. The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric; in fact, CP violation is observed in certain processes like kaon and B meson systems. So if the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry, can SMEFT operators break it? Well, SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators that can include terms that violate CP. So, I don't think all operators must respect CP symmetry. Some operators might violate it. So 3 is probably not a required symmetry for all operators.

Option 4 is CPT symmetry. CPT stands for Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry, and any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, then it must automatically respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must preserve CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, Poincaré is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz because it includes translations. But in SMEFT, when you write down operators, do they have to respect translation invariance? Because the operators
