Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, right? So I should probably check if this state is normalized. Let's compute the sum of the squares of the elements: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is not 1. So I think I need to normalize this state. That means I should divide each component by sqrt(6). So the correct state vector would be (−1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

But wait, the problem doesn't mention normalization. Hmm, perhaps it's given as a non-normalized vector, but in any case, I should proceed with the given vector as is unless told otherwise. Oh wait, no, probably in quantum mechanics, states are normalized, so perhaps the initial state is (−1, 2, 1), but it's not normalized. So I should probably normalize it because otherwise, the probabilities won't add up to 1.

So, first step: normalize the state vector.

The state is ψ = [−1; 2; 1]. The norm is sqrt( (−1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [−1; 2; 1].

Wait, but the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". So perhaps the state is already normalized, but that doesn't seem right because the sum is 6. Maybe the problem is in a different context, like perhaps it's not a quantum state but some other vector? Hmm, not sure, but I'll proceed assuming that the state is as given, perhaps not normalized, and will normalize it first.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). And the operator Q's matrix is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1).

The question is: if we measure P first, then Q, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no: the question says, "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So it's the probability of first measuring P=0, then Q=-1.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the order of measurements matters because the state collapses after each measurement. So first
