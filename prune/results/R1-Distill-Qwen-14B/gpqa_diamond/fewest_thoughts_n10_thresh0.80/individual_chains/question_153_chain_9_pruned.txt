Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each, and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. I remember that dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a conjugated dicarboxylic acid ester. It acts as the enolate in the Michael reaction. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the Michael acceptor. 

In the Michael reaction, the enolate (from the nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So, the malonate's enolate will attack the acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The acrylate has a double bond between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl group on C3. The malonate has two ester groups and a CH2 group in the middle.

When the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position (C3) of the acrylate, it will form a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would be a triester. Let me draw this mentally. The acrylate has (p-tolyl) on C3. So the structure after attack would have the malonate attached to C3. The product would then have three ester groups: two from the dimethyl malonate and the one from the acrylate. Wait, noâ€”dimethyl malonate is (CH2(COOEt)2), right? So when the enolate attacks, the CH2 part would add to the acrylate.

So the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. Wait no, the structure is actually CH2-C(COOEt)=CH-p-tolyl? Or wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOEt)-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. But 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) is on the CH2 group? Hmm, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Let me think again.

The correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOEt, but wait, that can't be right because acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So the '3-' refers to the position on the acrylate chain
