Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question presents three different Michael addition reactions, labeled A, B, and C. Each reaction has certain reactants, and I need to figure out what the major products are from each. Then, I'll match these products to the options provided (A to D).

Let me break down each part one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) â†’ (A)**

Alright, so I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position in an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile here would typically be the enolate ion of a carbonyl compound.

In this case, the nucleophile is probably from dimethyl malonate. Malonate can form an enolate because it's a diester. The base NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) should deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate. So, the enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, let me think about the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? Because the formula is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me correct. The structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the beta carbon. So, the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Or perhaps it's CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, not sure, but maybe that's a detail I can work around.

When the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, it would add to the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl). So, the enolate (from malonate) would attack the acrylate's beta position. The product after the addition would have the malonate's R group attached to the acrylate.

Wait, the dimethyl malonate is (
