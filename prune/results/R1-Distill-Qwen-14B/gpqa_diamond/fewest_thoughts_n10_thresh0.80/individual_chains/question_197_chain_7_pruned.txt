Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data and then determining what it becomes after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, right? So the starting compound probably has a ketone group.

Looking at the IR data first: the peaks. The big one around 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). The peaks around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. And the 3400–2500 region suggests some O-H or maybe an alkyne, but more likely O-H because that's a common peak in that range. Wait, but wait—what else could cause a peak around 1720? It could also be an ester or maybe an aldehyde, but the presence of a carbonyl is certain.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down. The peaks at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, probably an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have broad O-H stretches, but wait—if it's a carbonyl but not an acid, maybe an ester or ketone. But in the IR, the 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So if there's a broad peak at 10.5, that might be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a triplet or something. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a phenol? But then the carbonyl would point to something else.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm in NMR is a broad singlet (bs), so maybe a carboxylic acid. If that's the case, the IR would have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but the IR given is 3400-2500 cm-1. Oh right, in the IR, the broad O-H of a carboxylic acid would be around 3000-2500, which fits. So the compound might be a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but the IR also has a peak at 1720, which is consistent with a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or acid. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, so 1720 is a bit higher, which might indicate an ester or maybe a ketone. Hmm, confusing.

Looking at the NMR again. There's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets each integrating to two protons would suggest two substituents on the benzene ring, opposite each other. So like two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with substituents, the integration would be for the aromatic protons.

Wait, the NMR has 10.5 ppm (1H), which is probably an aldehyde—no, wait. If it's a carboxylic acid, that broad peak would be the -OH. But in that case, the IR should show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300. The given IR has a peak from 3400–2500, which could include the O-H stretch. So perhaps the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

But wait, the NMR at 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. Carboxylic acids usually have an O-H that's a broad peak, which fits. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. So
