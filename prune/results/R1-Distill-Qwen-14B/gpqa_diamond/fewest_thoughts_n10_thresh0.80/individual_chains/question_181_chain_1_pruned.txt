Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The pp chain is a major one, right? And within the pp chain, there are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each branch produces different neutrinos.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. So all other reactions continue as usual. The flux of neutrinos is the number per cmÂ² per second. We're looking at two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need the ratio of flux in band1 to band2.

I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos of higher energies compared to other branches. Because I remember that the main neutrino emission from the pp chain comes from the beta decays in the different branches. The pp-I and pp-II might produce lower energy neutrinos, while pp-III gives higher.

So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like those above a certain threshold) would be reduced. Let's say that band 2 (800-900) would be more affected if that's where pp-III neutrinos are. But wait, what's the typical energy range of pp-III neutrinos?

I think the main neutrinos from the Sun are from the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch and the main pp chain. Wait, no, the main pp chain has several branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, and I think it's the dominant one. Oh wait, no, the dominant branch is the pp-I. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: the pp chain in the Sun's core is the primary way for hydrogen to become helium. The pp-I branch is the most prominent, but there's also the pep branch, which is a minor part. The pp-III branch is another part of the pp chain and produces higher-energy neutrinos.

So when the Sun's core undergoes the pp-III reactions, they emit neutrinos. If pp-III stops, those neutrinos won't be produced anymore. So the neutrino flux at higher energies (like band 2) would decrease, while lower energies (band 1) might be less affected or maybe not affected much because they come from other processes.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between two bands. Let's think about the number of neutrinos each branch produces.

The pp-III branch contributes significantly to the high-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, the flux in the higher band (800-900 keV, band 2) would drop, but maybe band 1 (700-800) wouldn't change much because it's either from other branches or maybe lower energy neutrinos.

Wait, but neutrinos from the different branches have different energies. For example, the main branch (pp-I) produces lower energy neutrinos, while pp-III produces higher. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (band 2) would decrease, but the lower band (band 1) might not be as affected because they come from other processes.

Wait, but let's think about the energy spectrum. The flux in each energy band depends on how many neutrinos are emitted in that energy range. If pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (which are a big part of band 2) would be less. So flux in band 2 would decrease, while band 1, which is lower energy, might not be as affected because other branches (like pp-I) continue to emit neutrinos.

So before the pp-III stopped, band 1 and band 2 both had contributions from pp-III. But after stopping, band 2's flux is reduced because its neutrinos come from pp-III, which is now gone. Band 1's flux remains mostly the same because it's from other sources like pp-I and maybe other reactions.

So what's the ratio? Before, flux1 = a + b, where a is from pp-III
