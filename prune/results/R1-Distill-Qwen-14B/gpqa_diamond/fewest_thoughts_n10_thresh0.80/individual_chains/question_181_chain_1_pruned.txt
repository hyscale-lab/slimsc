Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question here. Hmm. Let me think about what I know regarding neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. 

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III reactions stopped, the change in neutrino flux would only be detectable now on Earth because the neutrinos take that long to reach us. Interesting.

But the question is about the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III branch affects the production of neutrinos in these two energy ranges.

I remember that the pp-III chain is one of the proton-proton chains in the Sun's core. It involves reactions where protons fuse into helium-4 nuclei. The main neutrinos we get from the Sun are from the pp-III branch, right? Oh wait, no, wait. The dominant neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, actually, the pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to the main pp-I and pp-II branches. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think. The main proton-proton chain is the pp-I branch, which produces a helium-4 nucleus via two steps. The pp-II involves the same initial steps but a different pathway for one of the reactions, and pp-III is another variation. But the main neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, particularly the beta decay of boron-8, which emits an electron neutrino. So if the pp-III branch stops, does that mean a portion of the neutrino flux will decrease?

Wait, but neutrino production in the Sun comes mainly from the pp-I and CNO cycles. The pp-III is a minor part. Hmm. So if the pp-III suddenly stops, how does that affect the overall neutrino flux?

But the question specifies that only the pp-III branch stopped, and all other reactions remain as they were. So neutrino production from other branches (like pp-I and CNO) is unaffected.

So, neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges based on the reactions. The pp-III
