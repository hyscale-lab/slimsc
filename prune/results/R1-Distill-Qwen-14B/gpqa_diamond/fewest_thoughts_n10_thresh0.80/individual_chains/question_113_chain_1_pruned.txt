Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see, I'll take it step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I remember that each of these techniques provides different kinds of information about the structure of the compound.

First, the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually mean O-H stretching. So I'm thinking either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, maybe around 2500-3300. But the peak here is at 3000, which is on the higher end. Maybe it's an alcohol because they typically show a broad peak due to hydrogen bonding. Or maybe another O-H group like in a phenol? Hmm.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I know that 1700 is a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The other peak at 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with C=C stretching? Wait, but aromatic C=C usually shows up lower, like around 1450-1600. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, like in a ketone or ester?

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has an alkene group. So maybe there's a double bond somewhere, which would explain the 1650 peak if it's conjugated with a carbonyl.

Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments have a mass of 45? Let's think. 45 is the molecular weight of a CH3CO group (like an ethyl fragment). Or maybe a ketene ion? Alternatively, the fragment could be a carboxylic acid (like a methyl group lost or something else). Wait, 45 is also the mass of (CH3)2O (which is 15+32=47, no that's not right. Wait, molecular formula for (CH3)2O is C2H6O. So molar mass is 46. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me calculate: 12*2 + 6*1 +16*1 =24+6+16=46. So maybe not. Alternatively, 45 could be C3H3O? No, that's 3*12 +3*1 +16 =36+3+16=55. Hmm. Alternatively, think about common fragments. The tropylium ion (C7H7+) has a mass around 91, so that's not it. Maybe a methyl group attached to something else? Or perhaps the fragment is a ketone group. Wait, another approach: think about the possible molecular formulas given the options.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's see, the molecular weights would be:

C6H12O: 6*12 +12 +16 =72+12+16=100
C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98
C6H10O2:72 +10 +32=114
C6H12O2:72 +12 +32=116

The mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z=45. So the fragment is 45. Let's think about what could break off to give 45. Maybe a cleavage that loses a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment.

Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO-? No, wait, (CH3)2CHO is 58. Or maybe (CH3)CO- is 43, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion (CH2CO) which is 44, but that's close to 45. Maybe not.

Another approach: looking for common fragments. The tropylium ion is at 91, but that's not helpful here. What about a CH2=CHCO group? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula of the compound has a part with a molecular weight of 45. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H
