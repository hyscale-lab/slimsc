Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic—and how that affects its thermodynamic and kinetic properties. Hmm, right.

The statement is incomplete: "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." And the options are about whether it's stronger or weaker, and faster or slower in these conditions.

Wait, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its tendency to be reduced. So a stronger oxidant has a higher tendency to gain electrons. For oxygen, in basic solutions, I think it's a stronger oxidant. Because in basic conditions, the pH is higher, and oxygen can more readily accept electrons. Like in the reaction where O2 is reduced to OH-.

Let me think about the standard reduction potentials. Oh yeah, I think in basic solution, the O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- has a higher E° than in acidic conditions. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. In acidic solution, the reduction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, and the E° is about 1.23 V. In basic, it's O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, which has the same E° because it's just a pH-adjusted version. Oh wait, no, actually, the E° is calculated under standard conditions, which include 1 M concentrations. So in basic solution, the actual reaction is more favorable because OH- is present, so the oxidizing power might be higher. Or is it the same? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The standard electrode potentials are measured under standard conditions, which for O2 is in acidic solution. So in basic, the actual E might be higher because the pH is higher. Or perhaps the same E° because the reaction is adjusted by the H+ or OH- concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the thermodynamic favorability in basic solution makes O2 a stronger oxidant. Wait, because in basic solution, O2 can form OH- which has a higher tendency to be reduced. So thermodynamically, in basic solutions, O2 is a stronger oxidant.

But wait, another angle: the strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by the E° value. A higher E° means it's a stronger oxidizing agent. So in acidic solution, the O2 has a higher E°, making it a stronger oxidant. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard E° for O2 in acidic solution is 1.23 V. But in basic solution, the actual E° is adjusted for pH. Let me compute that.

The formula to convert E° from acidic to basic conditions is E = E°(acid) - (0.0592/n) * pH. So if the pH is high, like in basic solution, the E would be lower. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Hmm, but wait, no. Oh wait, wait, no. The Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q). Or is it the other way around? Or maybe I should think about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps in basic solution, the oxidizing power of O2 is higher because OH- is a better proton source or something. Wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think about the actual reactions.

In acidic solution, O2 is reduced to water. The reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, E° = 1.23 V.

In basic solution, O2 is reduced to OH-: O2 + 2H2O +4e- → 4OH-, E° is the same 1.23 V because it's under standard conditions. Wait, but in reality, when pH is higher, the effective E might be higher. Because when you have higher pH, the concentration of OH- is higher, which affects the cell potential.

Wait, the standard E° is for when all ions are at 1 M concentration. So in a basic solution, the OH- is at higher concentration, but H+ is lower. So when you use the Nernst equation, for the same E°, the actual E might change.

Wait, the Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q). For the O2 reaction in basic solution, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O +4e- → 4OH-.

The reaction quotient Q is [OH-]^4 / ([O2][H2O]^2). Since in basic solution, [OH-] is high, Q is large, so the log(Q) is positive. So E = E° - (0.0592/4)* log(Q). Wait, but E° is 1.23 V when everything is at standard conditions. But in real conditions, when [OH-] is higher, Q increases, so E would be lower? Or higher?

Wait, for a spontaneous reaction, E must be positive. Let's compute. Let's say in very basic solution, pH is high. So [OH-] is, say, 1 M (pH 14). Then, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O +4e- → 4OH-.

The Q is (1)^4 / ( (1 bar) * (1)^2 ) ) = 1. So log(Q) is 0. So E is 1.23 V.

Wait, but if the solution is more basic, say [OH-] is higher. Let me take [OH-] = 10 M (pH 13). Then Q = (10)^4 / (1 * 1^2 ) = 10^4. Log(10^4)=4. So E = 1.23 - (0.0592/4)*4 = 1.23 - 0.0592= 1.1708 V. So E is lower than E°. Hmm, that suggests that under more basic conditions, the E is lower, meaning the oxidizing power is less. But that can't be right because in more basic conditions, the reaction is more favorable.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the sign wrong. Let me think about the Nernst equation again. The general form is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q). But wait, sometimes it's written as E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log(Q), but the direction depends on the reaction.

Alternatively, the Nernst equation can be written as E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log([red]/[ox]) for each half-reaction, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the higher the pH, the more favorable the reduction of O2 in basic solution. So O2 is a stronger oxidant in basic conditions. Because the product (OH-) is more favored when pH is high.

Wait, in acidic solution, the O2 is being reduced to H2O. In basic solution, it's being reduced to OH-. Since OH- is a stronger base, perhaps the reduction is more favorable, making O2 a stronger oxidizing agent in basic solutions. That would mean the thermodynamic statement is that O2 is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions.

So the first blank should be 'stronger'.

Now, the second part is about kinetics. Kinetically, how does O2 react in acidic versus basic solutions. Kinetics relates to reaction rates. The reaction rate depends on the activation energy and the concentrations of the reactants. I remember that in acidic solutions, O2 might have a faster reaction because H+ ions are available to help stabilize the transition state.

Wait, but wait, the rate of the reaction can be influenced by the presence of catalysts or by the presence of H+ ions. For example, the reduction of O2 often requires protons. In acidic solution, there are more H+ ions, which can help in the reaction mechanism. So the reaction might proceed faster in acidic conditions because the necessary H+ ions are readily available, lowering the activation energy.

Wait, but another thought: the reaction rate in electrochemical terms is often influenced by the concentration of ions involved in the reaction. So in acidic solution, since H+ is higher, the reaction might proceed more quickly. So the rate is faster in acidic conditions.

So the second blank should be 'faster'.

Putting it together, the first part is stronger, the second is faster. So looking at the options:

Option A) stronger – faster → correct.

But wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it: thermodynamic strength is about E°, while kinetic factors relate to how readily the reaction occurs, which could be influenced by the presence of H+.

So in basic solutions, O2 is a stronger oxidant because the pH is higher, which is more favorable for its reduction. In acidic solutions, the reaction is faster because the necessary H+ ions are present in higher concentrations, facilitating the reaction.

So the correct combination would be 'stronger' and 'faster', which is option A.


In electrochemistry, the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant depends on the pH of the solution. Thermodynamically, in basic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant because the reduction of oxygen to hydroxide ions (OH⁻) is more favorable under these conditions. This is due to the higher concentration of OH⁻ ions, which makes the reaction more thermodynamically favorable compared to acidic conditions.

Kinetically, in acidic solutions, oxygen reacts faster because the presence of H⁺ ions facilitates the reaction mechanism, lowering the activation energy and allowing the reaction to proceed more quickly. In contrast, in basic solutions, the absence of H⁺ ions can slow down the reaction.

Thus, the correct combination is that oxygen is a **stronger** oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions and reacts **faster** kinetically in acidic solutions.
