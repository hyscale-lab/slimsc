Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the orbital period is 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet, which is 2.5 times Earth's radius. What's the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that both transit and occultation events happen? The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, wait, what's a transit and occultation event? Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet moves behind the star, so we can't see its lightâ€”so the planet disappears from our view. For both to happen, the orbital plane must be edge-on for us, otherwise, we wouldn't see the transit. Oh, but the problem says the second planet shares the same orbital plane, so transits are possible. 

Wait, but what determines whether both events occur? Well, for a transit, the planet needs to pass in front of the star. For an occultation, the planet needs to pass behind the star. So, for both to happen, the orbital period must be such that the planet's orbit is aligned in a way that allows both events. But wait, that's probably more about the orbital period relative to our observation time. But I think the key here is to find the maximum period so that the two planets are in a configuration where the second can transit the star as well, given the first planet's period.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think: The two planets are in the same system, same star, same orbital plane. The first planet has a period of 3 days. The second has a radius 2.5 Earths. The question is about the maximum period of the second planet so that both transit and occultation occur for it. Or wait, the question says "exhibit both transit and occultation events." So, the second planet must transit (so we see a dip), and also be occulted (so it disappears behind the star). But for that, the planet's orbital period must be such that when the planet is behind the star, it's also in
