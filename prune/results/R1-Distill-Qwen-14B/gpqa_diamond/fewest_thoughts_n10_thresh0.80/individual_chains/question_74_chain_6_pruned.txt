Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let's try to think it through. So the question is about the probability that a certain atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the past 50 minutes. The decay probability within 100 minutes is given as 32%. Hmm.

Alright, first, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The basic idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it's all about the remaining time. So this should be a memoryless process, right? Like, the future decay doesn't care about the past—it's just about the current time onward.

Wait, the decay probability they gave is 32% over 100 minutes. So the probability P(t) that a nucleus decays in time t is 32% when t is 100 minutes. So we can model this using the decay formula. The decay law is usually expressed as P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. Oh wait, or wait, some sources say the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decay probability is 1 minus that. So yeah, P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that, when t=100 minutes, P(100) is 32% or 0.32. So let's write that equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Hmm, I can solve for λ from this. Rearranging: e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute this. ln(0.68) is approximately what? Well, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so ln(0.68) is around -0.3857 or something. Let me be more precise. Wait, but maybe I can compute it more accurately:

Alternatively, maybe I can compute ln(0.
