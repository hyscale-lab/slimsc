Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says that two stars have the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the main variables here are the shifts in their spectral lines.

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms (that's 5e-3 angstroms), and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period or the planet's properties?

I think the RV method's Doppler shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Oh, right! The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) ) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) 

But since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e≈0, making sqrt term ≈1. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the RV method's semi-amplitude K depends on (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(2/3)) ) multiplied by (1/(1 + (M_p/M_star)^(1/3))) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another formula: The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2πG) / (P c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star, and sin i ≈1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal). So K ≈ (2πG/(P c))^(1/3) * M_p / M_star^(2/3)

Wait, but since both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass, the ratio K1/K2 would relate inversely to something involving their orbital periods. Let's see.

Wait, the problem states that K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is7, so K2 is larger than K1. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

Wait, but wait: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )
