Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that there are two stars with exactly the same masses, each similar to the Sun. Around each, astronomers found a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. They used the Radial Velocity (RV) method to detect them.

The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift's periodicity tells us about the planet's orbit.

The data given are shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7. The question is how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like V = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but since the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (which is Sun-like), M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So we can simplify that.

So, the RV velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )^(1/1) ) * something... Wait, no, perhaps I should get the exact formula.

The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity is:

K = ( (2πG) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, sin i is approximately 1 if the orbit is edge-on, which is the case that gives maximum velocity. Since the problem says both planets are detected, probably their orbits are such that sin i is close to 1.

So, K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c)^(1/3) ??? Wait, maybe I should write it more accurately.

Wait, the correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( 2π c M_star^(1/3
