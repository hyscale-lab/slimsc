Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the brightness variations of a star with spots and how that compares to an exoplanet causing similar variations. 

Alright, so the setup is that there's a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness changes as the spots come into and out of view. This effect could mimic the presence of an exoplanet, since both would cause periodic dips in brightness when they pass in front of the star. But the question is, what size would the exoplanet need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots?

Wait, so I'm trying to find Rpl (the planet's radius) divided by Rstar (the star's radius). The star's radius is given as the same as the Sun, so Rstar is 1 solar radius. The options are given as fractions, so I'm looking for a ratio.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) depends on the area of the object blocking the star's light. For an exoplanet, the dip would be proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area is πRp² / πRstar², so the square of the ratio.

But in this case, the star has spots. So the brightness variation isn't just due to a solid black area (like a planet blocking light), but due to temperature differences. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer. The amount of dimming depends on how much of the star's surface is covered by these spots and the temperature difference.

So first, let's think about how the star's brightness variation due to spots works. The star emits with a certain luminosity, and when a spot is on the hemisphere facing us, it contributes less light. The total brightness variation should be the difference between the star's normal brightness and the brightness when the spots are visible.

The star's total luminosity is proportional to its surface area multiplied by the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4). The spots would have a lower temperature, so each spot's luminosity is less.

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but the star is a sphere, so one hemisphere is 50% of the surface area. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (πR²) because a hemisphere is 2πR², but wait, no: the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². A hemisphere would be 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². That's the area of the spots.

Each spot has a temperature of (6000 - 1000) = 5000 K. So the normal star emits L = 4πR² σ (6000)^4. The spots emit less: each spot's luminosity is σ (5000)^4 per unit area. So the total brightness change when the spots are on the visible hemisphere would be the normal brightness minus the brightness from the spots.

Wait, but when the spots are on the star's surface, their lower brightness contributes to a dip in the observed light. The change in brightness, ΔL, would be the difference between the normal contribution of the spotted areas and the actual contribution from the spots. 

So the normal (without spots) brightness of the spotted area would be 0.2 * (2πR²) * σ T^4. When the spots are present, it's 0.2 * (2πR²) * σ (T-ΔT)^4. The change in brightness is the difference between these two.
