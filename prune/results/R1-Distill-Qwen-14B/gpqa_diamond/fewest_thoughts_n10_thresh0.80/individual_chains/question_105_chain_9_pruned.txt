Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about a star with some spots and how it affects the brightness measurements, comparing it to an exoplanet transit.

Alright, the star has the same radius as the Sun, so Rstar = R_sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the area covered, I think. So 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When only one hemisphere is spotted, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. But the problem says that this situation can look like an exoplanet transit in terms of the light curve. So they want to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star.

Wait, the question says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would cause the same amplitude? So I need to compare the brightness change due to the spots to the brightness change due to a planet transit.

Let me break this down. I think the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) caused by the spots and then set that equal to the change caused by a planet transit, then solve for Rplanet.

First, the star's total brightness without any spots is based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so they make the star appear dimmer when they're on the visible side. But since the spots are only on one hemisphere, their effect on the total brightness depends on the observer's viewing angle as the star rotates.

Wait, but the problem says that the spots cover one hemisphere with 20% filling factor. So each hemisphere (Northern and Southern, say) has 20% coverage of spots? No, wait, the question says 'one hemisphere' is covered in spots. So maybe the entire hemisphere is 20% covered? Or is it that each spot on the hemisphere covers 20% of its area?

Wait, the filling factor is 20%, which is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface area covered by spots. So if the hemisphere has area A, 0.2*A is covered by spots.

But when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. When it rotates 180 degrees, the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so all spots are hidden. So the brightness variation would have a maximum when the unspotted side is facing us and a minimum when the spotted side is facing us.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the star is a sphere. The spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and go out of view. So the brightness variation would be periodic as the spots rotate into and out of the observable area.

But how does this affect the overall brightness?

The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, part of it is blocked by spots, which are cooler, so the total flux is lower. When the unspotted hemisphere (which is completely normal temperature) is facing us, the flux is higher.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots are moving. The brightness variation would be due to the portion of the spotted hemisphere that's visible changing as the star rotates.

Wait, no, the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view. Let me imagine the star as a sphere. When the star is viewed such that the center of the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the maximum number of spots would be visible. As it rotates, the spots move towards the limb and eventually become hidden when the star rotates 180 degrees, showing the opposite side which is unspotted.

But wait, if only one hemisphere is covered in spots, which
