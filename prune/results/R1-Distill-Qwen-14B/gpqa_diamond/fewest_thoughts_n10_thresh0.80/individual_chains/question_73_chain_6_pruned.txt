Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity. Right, because at those speeds, things like length contraction and time dilation come into play, and classical velocity addition doesn't work either.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should tackle the relative speed. Oh wait, wait. When you have two objects moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds in the classical sense. Because of relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities directly. Instead, I remember there's a formula for relativistic velocity addition.

The formula for the relative velocity v_rel when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or wait, maybe it's (v1 - v2) divided by something else. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, v1 is the faster one, 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So plugging in, let's compute that.

Wait, no. Wait a second. No, wait. Because the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So, in the frame of the second astronaut, the first is moving at what speed? Because that's the relative speed. So using the formula, v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

So plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. That's approximately 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which I think is one of the options. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that part could help narrow down.

Next, the total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. So for each astronaut, their total energy is gamma multiplied by their rest energy (mc²). Wait, but each has their own mass. So the first astronaut has a mass of 2m, moving at 0.6c. The second is 3m moving at 0.5c.

Let me compute each of their energies and sum them.

The formula for gamma is
