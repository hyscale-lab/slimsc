Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we have to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with a pH and volume.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down. First, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a base. To dissolve it, we'll probably need an acid. The acid is monobasic and strong, which means it will donate one proton and be completely ionized. So, maybe it's something like HCl, HNO3, or H2SO4, but since it's monobasic, H2SO4 would act as dibasic, so maybe HCl is the acid here.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid would be a neutralization reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. So the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O

Wait, but how much Fe(OH)3 are we dealing with? We have 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g /106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009359 mol. Let's say approximately 9.359e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions. So, the moles of H+ required would be 3 * 9.359e-4 ≈ 0.0028077 moles.

But wait, the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed would be moles of H+ divided by concentration. So volume (L) = 0.0028077 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028077 L, which is 28.077 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³ which is close. But let's see if there's another consideration.

Wait, does Fe(OH)3 actually require all those H+ ions? I mean, Fe(OH)3 is not very soluble. In pure water, it's not very soluble, but with an acid, it should dissolve more. But wait, in the problem, they're asking for the minimum volume needed to dissolve it. So perhaps the stoichiometric amount is sufficient, but sometimes you have to consider if any excess is needed. But maybe we can assume that just enough moles for stoichiometric reaction is sufficient.

So the volume would be approximately 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, C is 28.05, which is very close. So that's probably the correct volume.

Now, onto the pH of the solution. The resulting solution after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with acid would have Fe³+ ions and some excess H+ ions. But wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so when it reacts with acid, it forms Fe³+ and water. So the solution would be acidic because the strong acid is in excess.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the reaction again. The moles of H+ needed is 0.0028077. But how much H+ is provided by the acid?

The acid is monobasic, so each mole gives one mole of H+. The moles of H+ from the acid would be 0.1 M * V (in L). So V is 0.028077 L (28.077 cm³), so moles H+ from acid is 0.1 * 0.028077 = 0.0028077 mol. Which exactly matches the H+ required for Fe(OH)3. So, in this case, the moles of H+ from the acid exactly neutralize the OH- ions in Fe(OH)3, so perhaps there's no excess H+.

Wait, but wait a minute. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so its dissolution would release OH- ions. The acid provides H+ which reacts with OH- to form water. But in reality, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it's not a strong enough base to produce a lot of OH- ions in solution. Or perhaps, when you add the acid, you're just neutralizing the Fe(OH)3. So the stoichiometric reaction would require 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3. So if you add exactly the amount that reacts, then the solution after reaction would have Fe³+ and water. So the solution would be neutral? Or would it be slightly acidic? Wait, but Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me re-examine. Let's think about what happens when Fe(OH)3 reacts with an acid.
