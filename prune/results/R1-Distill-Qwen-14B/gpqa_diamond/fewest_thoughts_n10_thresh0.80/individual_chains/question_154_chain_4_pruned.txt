Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. The spectral information includes mass, IR, and 1H NMR data.

Let me break down each piece of data.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest at 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, molecular ion peaks usually indicate the molecular weight. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. The 158 peak is at 32%, which is about a third. That could be a fragment or maybe a chlorine isotope? Wait, chlorine has isotopes, right? The common isotopes are Cl-35 (75%) and Cl-37 (25%). So if the molecular ion is at 156, and another peak is at 158, that's a difference of 2. So that might be due to the presence of a chlorine atom in the molecule. Because when Cl-37 is present, it would make the molecular weight go up by 2 (since Cl-35 is the main isotope, but 37 is 25% abundant). So that matches with a molecule containing one Cl atom.

Next, the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1720 region is typically for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid, maybe an ester, or possibly an aldehyde. But wait, aldehydes usually have a peak around 1700, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H peak due to the acidic protons, and the carbonyl would be around 1700. But wait, the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid, maybe more like an acid chloride or an ester?

Wait, the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. That could be an O-H stretch. Oh, but also, maybe an aldehyde has a peak around 2800, but that's more about the C-H stretching. Alternatively, if it's a phenolic O-H, that would show a broad peak around 3200-3500. But the IR here is a broad peak from 3500 down to 2700. That seems too broad for a single group. Maybe it's an alcohol, but the broadness suggests something with hydrogen bonding, like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's an -OH group
