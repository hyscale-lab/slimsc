Alright, so I've got this question about radioactive decay and probability. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? Let me think through this.

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that's the probability that the atom decays in that 100-minute period. Now, they're asking, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the next 150 minutes? Or 150 minutes from the start, or from the current time? Oh, right, the question says 50 minutes have passed, so the next 150 minutes would be from now until 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total. Or is it 150 minutes from now, meaning 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total. So the time elapsed since the start is 200 minutes.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "the next 150 minutes." So it's 150 minutes after the current time. So the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

But the given data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the half-life or the decay constant must be derived from that.

Wait, but wait. The probability of decay in a certain time is given, so maybe I should use the decay equation. The general formula for the probability of decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time.

Alternatively, the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λ t). Wait, no, that's the survival probability. The decay probability is the complement. So decay probability P(t) = 1 - N(t)/N0 = 1 - e^(-λ t).

Wait, but in the question, it's given that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So we can solve for λ.

So let me compute that. Let's rearrange the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100 λ). So e^(-100 λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Take natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -100 λ.

So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately... Let's think. ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is closer to 0.7, so ln(0.7) is around -0.356. So ln(0.68) is maybe around -0.4005 (I remember that ln(2/3) is about -0.405, so close to that). Let me approximate it as -0.4005.

So λ ≈ 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.

So now, the question is, after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which I think is from t=50 to t=200 (50+150=200). Alternatively, it's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, another approach: since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes only depends on the current time, not on how long it's been since it was created. So the probability of decaying in the next 1
