Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

First, I think I should remember that the operator P for spin along an arbitrary direction n is given by the vector n dotted with the Pauli matrices. So if n is in the x-z plane, it must have components (nx, 0, nz), since the y-component is zero. So the operator P would be something like P = nx Sx + nz Sz, right?

Wait, wait. No, wait. The operator is actually the spin operator, which for a spin-1/2 particle is given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices multiplied by the direction vector. So the operator along direction n is P = (n · σ) * ħ/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. But the problem here is that each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given, so maybe P is built from those.

Wait, the problem says that P is a vector operator, and each component is known. So the operator P can be written as P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But the problem states that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector would depend on the angles θ and φ, perhaps? Wait, but the eigenvector would be along the direction n, so it's the spin-up state along that direction.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so the eigenvector is the state with spin +½ along the direction n. So the eigenvector corresponds to spin-up in that direction.

So the first thing I need to do is construct the operator P. The
