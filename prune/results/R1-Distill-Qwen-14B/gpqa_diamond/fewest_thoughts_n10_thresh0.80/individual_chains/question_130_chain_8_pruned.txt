Okay, so I've got this question about the redshift of objects observed through neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to break it down.

So the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand. The quasar's light is being absorbed by these hydrogen clouds. The Lyman alpha line is a specific wavelength that hydrogen emits or absorbs. I remember that Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet range, so maybe that's why it's relevant here.

Ground-based optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, right? So if the absorbed light is at 1216 Angstroms, which is ultraviolet, but we’re using optical telescopes, the wavelength must have been shifted into the visible range due to redshift. Otherwise, the light would be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see because the atmosphere absorbs UV. Oh, right, that's why we have space telescopes like Hubble for UV observations.

So the key here is that the Lyman alpha absorption (1216 Å) must be redshifted into the visible spectrum. Let me recall the formula for redshift. The redshift z is given by (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So z = (λ_obs - λ_emit) / λ_emit.

In this case, the emitted wavelength is 1216 Å. The observed wavelength has to be in the optical range. What's the range of optical wavelengths? Visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Å. So the observed wavelength λ_obs must be at least 4000 Å, I think.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The lower limit for optical telescopes. Well, the lower end is about 400 nm (violet), so 4000 Å is 400 nm. So let's set λ_obs to 4000 Å as the minimum detectable wavelength.

So plugging into the formula: z = (4000 - 1216) / 1216. Let me calculate that. 4000 minus 1216 is 2784. Divide that by 1216: 2784 / 1216. Let me compute that.

Wait, 1216 * 2 is 2432. 2784 minus 2432 is 352. 352 is about a third of 1216? Let me see, 1216 ÷ 3 is about 405. So 2.2784 / 1216 is 2.2784 = 2 + (352/1216). Since 352/1216 is approximately 0.289. So z is approximately 2.289.

Wait, but wait. I'm not sure if 4000 Å is the correct lower limit. Maybe I should consider the part of the spectrum that's accessible. For ground-based telescopes, the atmospheric window allows certain wavelengths to pass. For example, the Johnson UBV system starts around 350 nm, but maybe for practical purposes, the lower limit is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the observed wavelength must be in the visible, so let's take the lower end as ~400 nm, which is 4000 Å.

Wait, but 4000 Å is 400 nm, which is violet. Are ground-based telescopes able to observe that? I think they can, but maybe it's better to use the lower limit as, say, 3600 Å. Wait, no, 3600 Å is 360 nm, which is near UV, and the atmosphere would block that. So perhaps the visible range is above about 380 nm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the minimum redshift such that the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Å) is redshifted into the visible spectrum. So if the observed wavelength is, say, 4000 Å, then the redshift would be (4000 - 1216)/1216 ≈ 2.278, so around z=2.28.

Looking at the options: the choices are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Hmm, 2.28 is close to option D (1.9) or C (2.4). Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 4000 - 1216 = 2784. 2784 /1216 = 2.289. So approximately 2.29. So the closest option is C)2.4 or D)1.9? Well, 2.29 is between 2 and 2.4, but closer to 2.3. Hmm, but none of the options is exactly 2.29. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe I shouldn't take 4000 Å. Maybe the optical range is higher. Let's think differently. The question says 'optical ground-based telescopes.' So the maximum wavelength they can observe is about 700 nm (7000 Å), and the minimum is maybe around 300 nm, but that's getting into the UV where the atmosphere blocks most of it. So perhaps it's better to take the minimal wavelength as 3600 Å (360 nm), but I'm not sure if that's in the optical range.

Wait, 3600 Å is 360 nm, which is near UV. So ground-based telescopes can't observe that. So maybe the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission, after redshift, must be in the optical window. So what's the minimum redshift that brings 1216 Å into the optical.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the Lyman series. Wait, Lyman alpha is the first transition in hydrogen, from n=2 to n=1. The wavelength is 1216 Å (121.6 nm), which is in the far UV.

So for ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must be in the visible range. So, for the Lyman-alpha absorption to be observed, it must be redshifted into the visible. So the redshift z is such that (1 + z) * 1216 Å is equal to the observed wavelength in the optical.

So the maximum redshift allowed would be when the observed wavelength is at the upper limit of the optical spectrum, say 700 nm (7000 Å). Wait, no, that's the maximum. But in that case, the redshift would be (7000 - 1216)/1216 ≈ (5784/1216)≈4.76. So z would be about 4.76. But that's not the question here; the question is the lower limit.

Wait no, wait. If the observed wavelength is the lower limit of the optical, which is about 400 nm (4000 Å), then the redshift would be (4000-1216)/1216 ≈ 2.28.

But looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher than 2.28. So is 2.28 the lower limit? Because if the redshift is higher than that, the observed wavelength would be longer than 4000 Å (i.e., redder), which is still in the optical. So the minimal redshift is z=2.28, but the options have C as 2.4 and D as 1.9. Wait, 2.28 is between D (1
