Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The question is asking about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe would be limited by this process. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

First, I remember that the CMB is this radiation left over from the Big Bang, and it's pretty much everywhere. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, which is really low, like a tiny fraction of an electronvolt. So the CMB photons are not high-energy; they're more like low-energy background radiation.

The process mentioned is gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs. So, a high-energy gamma-ray photon (let's call its energy E_gamma) collides with a CMB photon (energy E_cmb) and they produce an electron and a positron. The reaction is γ + γ → e+ + e-.

I think the key here is to find the energy where the probability of this annihilation is so high that the gamma-ray doesn't travel far before annihilating. So, the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited by the time it takes before this interaction occurs.

Wait, but how does the energy relate to the interaction probability? I remember something about cross-sections and photon energies. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of a particular interaction happening. For pair production (like what's happening here), the cross-section depends on the energies of the colliding photons.

The cross-section formula for two photons annihilating into electron-positron pairs... I think it's given by the formula σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α²/(m_e²)) * (E1 * E2)/(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or wait, maybe it's a different formula. Alternatively, I think the cross-section might go as the product of the photon energies divided by some higher power, like E^2 or something. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the process's threshold energy.

Oh right, for the reaction to occur, the combined energy of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so the combined energy needs to be at least 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's the minimum; the problem is about high-energy gamma-rays, so this threshold is way below what we're dealing with. So that's probably not the limiting factor here.

But wait, the problem is about the lifetime of the gamma-ray. The lifetime would be limited by the interaction times the density of the target photons (CMB in this case). So the mean free path would determine how far the gamma-ray can travel before annihilating. If the mean free path is very small, the lifetime is short.

The mean free path λ is the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section σ and the photon density n. So the rate Γ would be σ * n * v, where v is the relative velocity. Since photons are moving at speed c, v is approximately c, but maybe in the frame where the CMB is isotropic, the average speed might be considered.

But wait, the CMB is a thermal bath of photons. So the number density n is related to the temperature. I remember that the CMB photon density is given by the formula n_cmb ≈ (g_cmb * T^3)/(2π²ħ³c³), where g_cmb is the number of degrees of freedom for the photon gas. But since the problem gives the average photon energy, maybe I can find n from that.

Wait, average photon energy for the CMB is given as E_cmb_avg = 1e-3 eV. The average energy of a photon in
