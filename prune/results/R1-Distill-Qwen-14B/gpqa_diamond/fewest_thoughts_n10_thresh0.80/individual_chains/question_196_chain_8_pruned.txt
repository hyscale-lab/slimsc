Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a 1D relativistic scenario. Wait, right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. That's when x is at maximum amplitude A. So the formula would be something like (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) which is option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so things are different.

In relativity, mass increases with velocity because of the Lorentz factor gamma. Oh right, the total energy equation comes into play here. The total energy E is gamma times mc². And the potential energy in the spring is (1/2)kx², but at maximum amplitude, x is A, so potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Oh right, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc².

So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all potential energy should convert into kinetic energy. So setting those equal: (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc². So solving for gamma, we get gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²). 

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1
