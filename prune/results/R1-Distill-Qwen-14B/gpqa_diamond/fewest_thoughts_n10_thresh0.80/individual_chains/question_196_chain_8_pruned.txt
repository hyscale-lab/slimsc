Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has its maximum speed when the potential energy is zero and all the energy is kinetic. But this is a relativistic version, so things are a bit different.

Wait, the question mentions that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. Right, so the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But in relativity, the energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the potential energy is converted into kinetic, which would be maximum speed. But wait, in the relativistic case, the equations are more complicated because energy and momentum are related.

I think the total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. Let me write that down: E = K + U. In the classical case, E would be (1/2)kA². But with relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², and the potential is (1/2)kx².

At maximum amplitude (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that's the same as classical, which can't be right because in relativity, the total energy also includes rest mass energy. Oh wait, no, in this case, perhaps the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kA² because of relativistic effects. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, the system's total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic plus potential. So E_total = mc² + K + U. Wait, no, because in the classical oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total mechanical energy is that. But in relativity, the total energy would include the rest mass as well. Oh wait, but the question is about the maximum speed, which happens at x=0, so all the energy (excluding rest mass) is kinetic.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy conservation equation. The total energy E at any point is the sum of the rest energy, kinetic, and potential. But wait, the potential is from Hooke's law, which is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, is that still the case? I think so because Hooke's law is a force law, and potential is derived from that, so it's (1/2)kx².

So at x=0, all the mechanical energy (excluding rest mass) is kinetic. So E = mc² + (γ -1)mc². Wait, no, because the mechanical energy would be the (γ -1)mc² plus (1/2)kx². Wait, but when x is at maximum A, velocity is zero, so E_mechanical is (1/2)kA². But the total energy E_total is mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential is zero, so all E_mechanical is kinetic. So (γ -1)mc² = (1/2)kA². So solving for γ, because γ = (1 + (1/2)(kA²)/(mc²)) / (mc²) * mc²? Wait, let's get this right.

Wait, the equation is (γ -1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

So (γ - 1) = (kA²)/(2 mc²).

So γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, B. So B = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + B.

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Let me square both sides.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + B)^2.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

Hmm, we can compute this as:

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1+B)^2] = c² [ ( (1+B)^2 -1 ) / (1+B)^2 ) ]

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2B + B² -1 ) = 2B + B².

So,

v² = c² [ (2B + B²) / (1+B)^2 ) ]

But B is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is a presumably small term if the oscillator isn't moving at speeds near c. But maybe in this problem, it's not necessarily small.

Wait, but let's see if I can simplify this expression.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is 2B + B² = B(2 + B).

Denominator is (1 + B)^2 = 1 + 2B + B².

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can write the entire expression as:

v² = c² ( (1 + B)^2 -1 ) / (1 + B)^2 )

Wait, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, perhaps I can take the square of the equation for v.

Wait, let me recap. We have:

(γ -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²)

Which is,

γ = 1 + ( (k A²) )/(2 mc² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

We can rearrange this to solve for v.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 mc²) as a variable, say, α. So α = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + α)

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + α)^2 ]

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expand numerator: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, not sure if this can be simplified further. Let's substitute back alpha.

v^2 = c² [ (2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

First term: 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

Second term: (k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4 )

So numerator is (k A^2)/( m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, looking at the answer options. Let's see:

Option C is sqrt( (k A^2)/m ), which is the classical expression. So in classical mechanics, that's the maximum speed.

But in relativity, since v
