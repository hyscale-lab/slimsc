Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to work through this.

Let me first recall what a pseudosphere is. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? It's like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere. But wait, in the context of metrics, a pseudosphere might be related to a metric with a specific form.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Interesting. So the line element is given in terms of x and y coordinates. I think this is in 2D, so maybe it's a 2-dimensional manifold.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, radius here probably refers to the curvature radius. For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative. The metric given seems to have terms in x² and y² in the denominator, which might relate to the curvature.

Let me think about the metric. It's written in terms of a conformal factor, since it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²). So the metric is conformally flat. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

I remember that for a metric of the form ds² = e^(2φ) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is related to the function φ. But wait, in this case, the conformal factor is 32/(
