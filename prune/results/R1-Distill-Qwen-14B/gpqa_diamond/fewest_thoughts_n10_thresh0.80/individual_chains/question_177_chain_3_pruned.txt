Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits, right? And stars are often modeled as black bodies, so I guess I'll need to use the black body radiation formula.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2, but wait, does mass matter here? The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature. Oh, unless they're hinting at something else like using mass to find something else, but maybe not directly here.

The spectroscopy part says the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's a key point.

Wait, but wait. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity is the component of a star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. But in this context, how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right! This is about the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, it's redshifted.

So, the observed wavelength is affected by the star's velocity. But wait, in the problem, the 'wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest' are the same. Hmm. Does that mean the observed wavelengths are the same, or the emitted wavelengths?

Wait, the problem says they "determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So that would be the observed wavelengths. So even though their actual emitted wavelengths (from their own rest frames) might be different, due to Doppler shift, the observed λ_max are same.

Wait no, that's not right. Because if a star is moving, the observed λ_max shifts. For example, if a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity), the observed λ would be shorter (blue shifted). But in our case, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, but which direction? Because the sign matters. If Star_2 is moving away, then its λ_max would be redshifted, meaning longer wavelength. If moving towards us, blueshifted, shorter wavelength. But the problem just says 700 km/s, but it's positive or negative? Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Oh, wait, so Star_1 has v_r = 0, and Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Hmm, but are they moving towards or away? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe the sign isn't given, but perhaps the magnitude is 700.

Wait, wait, no. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So I think the velocities are Star_1: 0, Star_2: 700. But without the direction, I might have to assume it's moving away, which would cause a redshift. Or perhaps I can just consider the magnitude and figure out the effect on the observed temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. The formula for Doppler shift is approximately (Δλ/λ) ≈ v/c, where v is the radial velocity. But since Star_2 has a higher velocity, that would shift its observed wavelength.

But earlier, I thought that the peak wavelengths observed are the same. So if Star_1's λ_max is λ, then Star_2's observed λ_max would also be λ. But Star_2's emitted λ_max would be different because of the Doppler shift. So their actual temperatures are different, but their observed λ_max is the same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate.

Black body radiation peak wavelength λ_max = b / T. So if Star_1's emitted λ_max is λ1, then λ1 = b / T1. Similarly for Star_2, λ2 = b / T2.

But due to Doppler shift, the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be λ2_observed = λ2 * (1 + v_r2 / c), assuming v_r2 is positive when moving away (redshift). If Star_2 is moving away, v_r2 is positive, so observed λ is longer.

But according to the problem, λ1_observed = λ2_observed. So λ1 = λ2_observed.

So combining these equations:

λ1 = (λ2) * (1 + v_r2 / c) 

But λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2 => λ2 = b / T2.

Substituting:

λ1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ1 = b / T1.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Divide both sides by b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Hmm, but wait, what's v_r2? The radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. But if it's moving away, then v_r is positive, which would cause a redshift (λ_observed > λ_emitted). Alternatively, if it's moving towards us, v_r is negative, leading to blueshift (λ_observed < λ_emitted). But the problem doesn't specify, but from the way the velocities are given, Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700. So perhaps we can take v_r2 as 700 km/s, assuming it's moving away (so positive), leading to a redshift.

So substituting v_r2 = 700 km/s. Let me compute (v_r2 / c) first. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 / 3e5 is about 0.002333... So (1 + v_r2/c) is approximately 1.002333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So T1 is slightly less than T2. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, but Star_1 is larger in radius than Star_2. Both are black bodies.

The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

So let's compute the ratio L1 / L2.
