Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through the concepts involved.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Here's the given information:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because if lambda is same, T is same. Because lambda is inversely proportional to T.
- The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, right? So the star moving towards us would have its light blueshifted, and moving away would cause redshift. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars "appeared brightest" are the same. Hmm, maybe that's the rest wavelength, not the observed one? Or perhaps the Doppler effect is considered in the temperature calculation. I need to think about that.

The problem states that the stars are black bodies, so their luminosity can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So I need to find L1 and L2 and their ratio.

But wait, the temperatures might be affected by the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would make it appear hotter, and moving away would make it appear cooler. So the observed temperature from the peak wavelength would change based on the star's velocity.

Wait, but in the problem, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So this is the observed wavelength, right? Because if they have the same observed lambda_max, but their actual temperatures might differ based on their velocities.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If a star is moving towards us,
