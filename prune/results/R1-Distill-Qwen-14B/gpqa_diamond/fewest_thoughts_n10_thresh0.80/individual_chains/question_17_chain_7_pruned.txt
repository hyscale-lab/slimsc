Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The stochiometric ratio here is 1:1, I think, because Ca-EDTA would be CaY²- maybe. So the complex is CaY²-.

Wait, the formation constant, Kf, is given as 5e10. But wait, sometimes Kf is the formation constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-. So in that case, the complex is formed with those charges.

But in the question, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

So, the dissociation reaction would be: CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-. The formation constant Kf is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). But wait, when the complex dissociates, it's the reverse of the formation. So the dissociation constant would be Kd = 1/Kf.

Right, because Kd is the inverse of Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the expression for Kd is ( [Ca²+][Y^4-] ) / [CaY²-] ) = Kd.

Assuming that the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. But wait, the EDTA is in excess? Or is it just the complex present?

Wait, the problem says it's a stochiometric solution. Oh, wait, stochiometric—meaning that the concentrations are in exact stoichiometric ratios. Hmm, wait no, I think stochiometric here refers to the complex being formed in a
