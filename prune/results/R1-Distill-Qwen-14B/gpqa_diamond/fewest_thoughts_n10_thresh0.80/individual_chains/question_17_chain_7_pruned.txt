Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem states that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) is a measure of the stability of the complex. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and EDTA. So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but in this problem, we're given the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, the complex is already formed. I think the formula for the formation constant would involve the concentrations of the ions and the complex.

The formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA^4-] )

But wait, when EDTA forms a complex with a metal ion like Ca²+, the free EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So the equation is: Ca²+ + Y^4- → CaY^2-.

In this case, since the solution contains the complex, the concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M. But I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, but if the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, that means the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are such that all the Ca²+ is tied up into the complex. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think. If it's stoichiometric, then the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. Because each Ca²+ combines with one EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be 0.
