Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, the enolate acts as the nucleophile in this case.

The problem has three parts: A, B, and C. Each is a reaction, and I need to find the products.

Let me start with part A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. I think NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. It would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a diester with two ester groups. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. So, when it forms an enolate, the beta carbon would be the one next to the carbonyl. The enolate would attack the beta position of the other compound, which is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, the other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but with a substituent. Oh wait, no, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Because 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O-) with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which is the same as the carbonyl carbon. Oh, wait, no. That canâ€™t be right because the carbonyl is at position 2. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Or perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So structure would be CH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH
