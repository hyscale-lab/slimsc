Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and m is small. B is given as 1 Tesla. The wavelength provided is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is related to the transition energy ΔE.

Hmm, I remember that the paramagnetic coupling term is part of the Hamiltonian when you have an external magnetic field. The term is usually something like -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * something involving angular momentum. Oh wait, more specifically, the magnetic moment μ is proportional to the orbital angular momentum L, right? So μ = (μ_B) L, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but wait, in the hydrogen atom, the orbital magnetic quantum number m has small values. Oh, right, m can be 0, ±1, ±2, etc., up to ±l. So small m would mean that the term involving m in the Hamiltonian might be small. But wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is part of the energy shift due to the magnetic field, so the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to this term would involve m. 

The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom. The given wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers. I think that's the wavelength of the photon emitted during the transition. So I can calculate ΔE using the relation E = hc/λ.

Right, so first, I need to compute ΔE. Let me get the constants straight. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So ΔE = hc / λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m) 

Let me compute that. Let's calculate the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divided by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.089e-19 J. Hmm, but wait, that's in joules. To get it in electron volts, since often atomic energies are expressed in eV, I think 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that's
