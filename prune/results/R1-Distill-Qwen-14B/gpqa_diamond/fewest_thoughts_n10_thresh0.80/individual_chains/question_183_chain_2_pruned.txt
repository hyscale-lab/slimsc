Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a certain reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, what's the index of hydrogen deficiency? Oh right, that's the count of rings plus double bonds in the molecule. Each ring or each double bond counts as one. So the formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, I think X and N aren't factors here because the compound is organic, maybe without halogens or nitrogen? So I'll focus on C and H.

So the first step is to figure out what the product is when the starting material reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI can induce a reaction called the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe some other functional group. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus is often used in the deoxygenation of ketones, but wait, maybe it's more about elimination or maybe even something else.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw its structure mentally. So the cyclohexene ring—so six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?), wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH-.

Wait, structure: cyclohexene ring. Position 3 is the double bond. So maybe the double bond is between C3 and C4? So the ring is cyclohex-3-ene. Then, at position 2 (so adjacent to the double bond), there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 (which is two carbons away from position 3), there's a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂ with a double bond? Wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH- as a substituent.

Wait, the formula is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the main ring is cyclohexene (so one double bond in the ring already). Then, the carboxylic acid group is attached somewhere. Wait, the numbering: the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Let me think—if it's cyclohex-3-ene, the positions are numbered such that the double bond is between C3 and C4. Then, position 2 is next to C3, and position 5 is next to C4? Or wait, perhaps I should imagine the ring as 1,2,3,4,5,6. So cyclohexene with double bond between 3 and 4. Then, substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl group).

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring. At position 2, a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH
