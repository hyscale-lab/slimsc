Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a large number of identical systems, each containing a particle that behaves according to a specific wave function. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Interesting. And when they measure the positions of these particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, all the particles are confined within x being between 1 and 3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, especially the normalization condition. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So, the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should be 1.

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, wait a minute, that's a complex wave function. So, the wave function is a complex number. To find the probability, I need to compute the square of its magnitude. 

The magnitude of a complex number z = c1 + ic2 is sqrt(c1² + c2²). So, |ψ|² would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)², right?

But wait, the wave function given in the problem is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So, |ψ|² is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Now, the normalization condition says the integral from x=1 to x=3 (since the particles are only found there) of |ψ|² dx should equal 1.

So, the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let's split this integral into two parts: the first part is a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, and the second part is 0.25 times the integral of dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), right? Evaluated from 1 to 3. So, ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). Because 1+x at x=1 is 2, and at x=3 is 4.

The second integral is just the length of the interval, which is 3-1=2. So, 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5. Solving for a² gives a² = 0.5
