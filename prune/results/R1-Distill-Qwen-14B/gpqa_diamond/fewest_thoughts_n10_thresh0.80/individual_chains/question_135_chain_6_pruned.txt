Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, I remember that when a boson like this decays, it has to follow certain rules based on the interactions allowed by the Lagrangian. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives the Lagrangian as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction term is involving the boson X coupling to fermions. Wait, the fermion fields are denoted by ψ_f, and the mass term probably comes from the υ term. But I might be getting ahead of myself.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the allowed decay products must have masses that sum to less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, when a particle decays, the combined rest mass of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the decaying particle. Otherwise, it's kinematically forbidden.

So what fermions are light enough? Let's list the known fermions and their masses.

Quarks:
- up (u), down (d): light, around a few MeV each.
- strange (s): about 100 MeV.
- charm (c): around 1.5 GeV.
- bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV.
- top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So X can't decay into t quarks because 6 GeV isn't enough for two top quarks (each about 173 GeV, so two would be 346 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV).

Leptons:
- electron (e): ~0.5 MeV.
- muon (μ): ~105 MeV.
- tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV.
- neutrinos: nearly massless, but since the problem probably treats them as massless or negligible, but X can decay into a fermion and its antiparticle, so neutrinos are allowed. But wait, in the Lagrangian, is there a coupling to neutrinos? The problem states that the interaction is with fermions, so I'm assuming all fermions are included unless specified otherwise.

Wait, but the problem's Lagrangian is written as ψ_f, so perhaps the fermion fields include all types. But wait, what about the structure of the Lagrangian? Let me parse it again. The term is -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction is between X and ψ_f. That suggests that X can couple to any fermion ψ_f. So all fermions are possible decay products, as long as their mass plus the mass of their antiparticle is less than X's mass.

Wait, but in reality, the decay products must be pairs. So for a fermion f, the decay would be X → f f̄. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of f, right? Or wait, no, because the rest mass of f is m, so each f is m, so the sum
