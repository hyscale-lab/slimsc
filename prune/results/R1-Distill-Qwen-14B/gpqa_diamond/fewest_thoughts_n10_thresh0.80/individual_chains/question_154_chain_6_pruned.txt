Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with spectral analysis, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So the chemist found a white solid, and he has some spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is based on the data.

First, the mass spectrometry data: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, molecular ion peaks usually indicate the molecular weight. So the molecular weight is 156. The peak at 158 is probably a fragment or maybe a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has isotopes, right? The common ones are around 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So if the molecule has a chlorine atom, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at m/z = (156 - 35) + 37 = 158. Because 35 is the main isotope, but 37 is the next. So the peak at 158 is likely the M+2 peak due to the chlorine isotope. So that suggests the molecular formula has a Cl.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl (C=O) group. Carboxylic acids have strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1, maybe a bit higher. Also, if the peak is sharp, maybe it's not a conjugated carbonyl or something else. Alternatively, could it be an ester or a ketone? But the broad IR suggests maybe an acidic -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the 1H NMR: There's a peak at 11.0 ppm, a singlet integrating for 1H. That's really high, so probably an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes a bit higher. Carboxylic acids can be around 10-12 ppm, but the broadness can vary. Oh wait, the IR had a broad peak, which might suggest an -OH (like in a carboxylic acid), so maybe that 11 ppm is the -OH proton. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad because of hydrogen bonding. So in the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which would be a single proton. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would fit. Alternatively, an aldehyde would have a singlet, but the peak is higher. Wait, wait, wait. Another thought: maybe it's a phenolic OH? But phenolic OH protons are usually around 5-7 ppm if they're not exchanged, but when they exchange, they might show up as a broad peak. But the 11 ppm seems more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the 1H NMR has another set of peaks: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are doublets, each integrating for two protons. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. So if the aromatic protons are para, like two doublets, each with two H, that's typical for something like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. So perhaps a benzene ring with a substituent at position 2 and another at position 4? Or maybe a substituent in position 1 and another in position 3? Wait no, the substituents would be in positions that are para to each other, like 1 and 3? Wait, no. For a para-substituted benzene, the protons are in two sets of doublets. Like, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the adjacent protons would be split into two doublets. So for example, if the substituent is at position 2, then the protons at 6 and 4 would be the ones coupling, each having a doublet. Wait, maybe I'm getting this a bit mixed up.

Wait, another thought: the presence of two doublets (each with 2H) suggests that the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. So like, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, no, that wouldn't give two doublets. Wait, perhaps the substituent is at position 2 and position 4? Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think again. Alternatively, if there's a substituent in position 4, and another in position 2, but that doesn't make sense for a para substitution. Wait, perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzene, but with more than one substituent. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. So the ring has two groups attached at opposite ends. For example, if the groups are in positions 1 and 3, or 2 and 4, but perhaps the substituents are such that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options and see which ones match.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

So structure would be benzene ring with Cl at position 3, hydroxyl at 2, and aldehyde at position 1. Wait, wait, numbering the ring as positions 1, 2, 3, etc. Let me try to draw it mentally. So, position 1 is Cl, position 2 is OH, position 3 is aldehyde? No, that can't be. Wait, no, the name is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So, benzaldehyde (aldehyde group at position 1), then Cl is at position 3 and OH at position 2. So the ring has substituents at positions 2, 3, and 1 (aldehyde). That would make it a tri-substituted ring, perhaps. But the NMR only shows four aromatic protons; wait, no, wait: the NMR shows 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H), so that's 4 aromatic protons in total. So the molecule must have a para-substituted ring, which would have two protons in each of two sets. So if the ring has substituents in two para positions, that would leave two pairs of protons. So in the NMR, each pair would give a doublet.

But wait, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have three substituents on the benzene ring: Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at position 1. So the substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3. That would make a tri-substituted ring, which would have more than two sets of protons. Hmm, perhaps the NMR would show more peaks. So maybe that's not the correct structure.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

So structure: benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1. So that's a di-substituted ring, with substituents in positions 4 and 1, which are para to each other. Wait, no. Wait, benzoic acid is COOH attached to benzene at position 1. 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl at position 4. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, which are para. So that would make the ring di-substituted, para. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets. That matches the NMR data.
