Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question says the aperture is shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light of wavelength λ is falling vertically along the z-axis. The task is to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can use the approximation tanθ ≈ θ because the angles are small.

Wait, so when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So, this must be a problem related to single-slit diffraction, but maybe something else because polygons have multiple sides. Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is a central bright spot surrounded by rings, not minima like in a single slit. But wait, the question mentions intensity maxima and minima, which makes me think of something else. Oh, wait, no—maybe it's a slit with multiple edges, but when N is very large, it's like a continuous edge, so perhaps it's a problem similar to a single slit but with a different shape?

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at angles θ where a sinθ = mλ, m being integers. The first minima would be at m=1, giving θ = λ/(a), but wait, no—single-slit formula is for a slit of width 'a', and the minima are at a sinθ = mλ. So for the first minimum, m=1, so θ = λ/(a) but that's only if a is the slit width. Wait, but in this problem, the apothems are all length 'a'. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, wait, the problem says the apothems are the same length. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side in a regular polygon. So for a regular N-gon, the apothem is a = (s)/(2 tan(π/N)), where s is the side length. But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' would be the radius of the circle, right? Because for a regular polygon with
