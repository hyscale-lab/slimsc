Okay, so I have this question about a quasar and its observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. The question gives me some specific data about the peak wavelength and flux drop, and then asks about the comoving distance from Earth under the Lambda-CDM model with certain parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it.

First, the observations: a peak at 790 nm in near-infrared and optical, and flux drops significantly below that. Wait, the peak wavelength is 790 nm. I remember that in astronomy, the peak wavelength of emitted light can relate to temperature via Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, about 2.9e-3 m·K. So if I can find the temperature, maybe I can figure out if this is a blackbody spectrum, which would imply a certain redshift.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the peak is due to the quasar's emission or something else. The quasar might emit a lot of radiation across the spectrum, but perhaps the peak is part of its continuum emission. Alternatively, maybe it's a broad emission line or something else. Hmm, but the question mentions the near-infrared and optical, so maybe the peak is in the rest frame of the quasar.

Assuming the peak is part of a blackbody spectrum, which quasars often are, we can calculate the temperature. So let's proceed with that.

So lambda_peak = 790 nm. Let me convert that to meters: 790e-9 m. Using Wien's Law, T = b / lambda_peak. Plugging in the numbers: T = (2.9e-3 m·K) / (790e-9 m). Let me compute that. 2.9e-3 divided by 7.9e-7. Let's see, 2.9e-3 is 0.0029, and 7.9e-7 is 0.00000079. So 0.0029 / 0.00000079 is approximately 3671 K. That seems a bit low for a quasar, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, quasars typically have very high temperatures, like in the millions of Kelvin. Did I mess up the units? Oh wait! Wait a second. Because when we observe the peak wavelength, if the source is moving away from us, we have to consider redshift. The observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

So if the quasar is at high redshift, the emitted peak might have been shorter (blue side), but due to redshift, it's observed longer. So perhaps the emitted peak is in the UV, but due to redshift, we see it in the optical or near-infrared.

Wait, but how would that affect the calculation? Let me think. Suppose the quasar emits a blackbody spectrum with a certain peak wavelength in its rest frame. We observe it at a longer wavelength because of redshift. So the observed peak is lambda_obs = lambda_emit*(1 + z). So if the observed peak is 790 nm, but the emitted is, say, 121 nm (like the
