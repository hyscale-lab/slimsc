Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read through it again and see what I can understand.

The question is about identifying compound E from a series of reactions starting with compound A. There are four steps in the reaction pathway. I'll try to break each step down and see what happens.

First, let's look at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A, B, C, D, each being a cyclic ketone.

Okay, so first, I need to figure out what compound A is based on the hints. Let's think about hint a.

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, what's a phosphorous ylide reaction? Oh, right! That's the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. So compound A must be an aldehyde or ketone.

The product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene. The product given here is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure. So, cyclopentane ring with substituents. At positions 1 and 2, methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)- group attached via the double bond, right?

Wait, so propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)2? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C- attached as a substituent via a double bond. So the cyclopentane ring has a substituent that's a double bond to a group, which is (CH3)2C-CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. The substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH2) group attached to a CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part. Hmm, perhaps I should sketch the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the starting material for the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent (ylide) would have a double bond
