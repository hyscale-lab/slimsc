Okay, so I need to figure out what compound E is based on the reaction steps provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the given reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided.

Hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorus ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, right? So the Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with a ylide. So compound A must be a carbonyl compound. The product given is a cyclopentane derivative with substituents and a propenylidene group.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(-CH3)=CH2 group attached to the ring. So the Wittig reaction would have converted the carbonyl group in compound A into an alkene in compound B after the ylide reaction. So maybe compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative with a carbonyl group. When the ylide (which has a CH2-C(-CH3)=CH2 part) reacts, it would add the double bond.

Wait, but the Wittig reaction would take a carbonyl group (like ketone or aldehyde) and convert it into an alkene. So if the product is a cyclopentane with that substituent, compound A must have a carbonyl group in a position that, after reaction with the ylide, would form that structure.

Alternatively, maybe compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents, and the ylide adds a propenyl group. Let me think about the structure. The product has the propan-2-ylidene group attached to the cyclopentane. So the ylide would have been something like (CH2)2CH-PPh3+ which would generate the ylide CH2-C(=CH2)CH3. Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene is CH(CH2CH2) maybe? Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the group CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? No, propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)2, so the ylide would be CH2-C(CH3)= something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene is a substituent on the cyclop
