Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and when it's dissolved in an acid, it should react, probably in a neutralization reaction. The acid is monobasic, which means it donates one H+ ion per molecule. Since it's a strong acid, it should completely dissociate.

First step: I think I need to write the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Let's see, the acid is monobasic, so let's call it HX, but actually, for generality, maybe using H+ is better. The reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Wait, wait. Yeah, because each OH- from Fe(OH)3 will react with H+ from the acid. So for each Fe(OH)3, three H+ are needed. So the mole ratio is 1:3.

So, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present in 0.1 grams. Then calculate the moles of H+ required, which will tell me the volume of 0.1 M acid needed.

Let me compute the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16.00, and Hydrogen (H) is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3O + 3H.

So 55.85 + 3*(16.00) + 3*(1.008) = 55.85 + 48 + 3.024 = 55.85 is about 55.85, 48 is 48, so 55.85 +48=103.85, plus 3.024 gives 106.874 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol. Let's calculate that more precisely: 0.1 / 106.874 is about 9.357e-4.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

Now, the acid is 0.1 M HX. Wait, wait, but HX is monobasic, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So the molarity is 0.1 M H+.

So the volume needed is moles of H+ divided by concentration. So volume V = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³.

Wait, but the options don't have this exact number. Let me look. Option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that
