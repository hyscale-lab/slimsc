Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength, lambda. The question is about the radiated power in the radiation zone, specifically how it depends on lambda and the angle theta measured from the z-axis.

So the question is asking two things: what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and what the form of the function f (which is the power per unit solid angle) looks like in terms of lambda.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a lambda dependence.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the source's symmetry and the oscillation's nature. Since it's a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating, I think it's a dipole-like radiator maybe, but not exactly a simple dipole because spheroidal is more like a dipole but perhaps a quadrupole? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the charge distribution is spheroidal, so maybe it's an oscillating dipole. Because a dipole's radiation pattern is different from a monopole or a quadrupole.

Wait, wait, so dipole radiation. The radiation from an oscillating dipole is given by the dipole antenna's radiation pattern. In the far field (radiation zone), the power radiated depends on the angle theta from the dipole's axis.

I recall that the radiation pattern for a dipole has a sin^2(theta) dependence in the intensity. Because the intensity (which is power per unit area) is proportional to sin^2(theta), where theta is the angle from the dipole's axis. So the maximum intensity occurs at theta = 90 degrees, where sin(theta) is 1.

Wait, but the problem asks about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees. So first, I need to find what the power per unit solid angle is at that angle, compared to the maximum.

Wait, wait. The power per unit solid angle is given by some function f(lambda, theta). The function f
