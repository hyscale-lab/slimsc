Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which I think is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but maybe I should clarify. Oh right, rhombohedral means all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees each.

The question is asking about the (111) plane. I recall that the interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by the formula 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) ... wait, is that correct? Or is there a different formula for rhombohedral systems?

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) − 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) − 2(h l cos β)/(a c) − 2(k l cos α)/(b c)

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are equal, so α = β = γ. That should simplify the formula. So since all a, b, c are the same (let's say a), the formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos γ / a²

Wait, let me make sure. Because when a = b = c, the terms like h k cos γ/(a b) become h k cos γ /a². And since all three angles are the same, it's the same for each term. So each of the cross terms (hk, hk, hl, etc.) would involve cos γ.

So for a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ) / a²,

where θ is the angle between the axes
