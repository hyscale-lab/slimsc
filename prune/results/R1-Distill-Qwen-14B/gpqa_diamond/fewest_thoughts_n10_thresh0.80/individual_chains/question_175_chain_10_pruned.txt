Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, and the symmetry axis is along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. They're asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone, which is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

So the problem is giving options for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the possible form of f. The options are A, B, C, D with different fractions and lambda dependencies.

I remember that in antenna theory and radiation, the radiation pattern depends on the type of antenna. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (theta=90 degrees) and falls off as you go towards the poles (theta=0 and 180). The radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta), but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, but the charge distribution here is spheroidal. Maybe it's like a dipole but in a different configuration. Or perhaps a quadrupole? Well, the problem states it's oscillating, so it's an oscillating dipole maybe?

Wait, another thought: the radiation from a dipole varies with theta as sin^2(theta), but for higher multipoles, the angular dependence is more complex. However, the question is about the maximum power at a certain theta, so perhaps the maximum occurs at a particular angle.

Wait, the maximum power is A, and we need the fraction at theta=30 degrees. So if the maximum occurs at some other angle, like theta=90, then the value at 30 would be a fraction of that maximum.

Wait, for a dipole, the power pattern is maximum at theta=90 degrees, and decreases as you move towards the poles. So at theta=30, it's less than the maximum. Let me think: the maximum is at theta=90, and the radiation pattern is proportional to (sin theta)^2. So at theta=30 degrees, sin theta is 0.5, so sin^2(theta)
