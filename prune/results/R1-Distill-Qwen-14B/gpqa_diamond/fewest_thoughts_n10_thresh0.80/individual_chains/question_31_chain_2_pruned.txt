Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with toluene being treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to make product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, resulting in product 3. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product 3, with options A to D.

Hmm. I remember that nitric acid and sulfuric acid are commonly used as nitrating agents. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. When you nitrate toluene, the methyl group is an activating group, so the nitration happens in the para position, I think. So product 1 should be para-nitrotoluene. Wait, or is it para? Or could it be meta? No, wait, methyl is an activating group and the nitration occurs in the para position because it's an electron-donating group. So product 1 is methylbenzene with a nitro group in the para position. So it's para-nitrotoluene.

Next step, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. For nitrotoluenes, oxidation can lead to different products based on the position. But wait, para-nitrotoluene... when oxidized, toluene derivatives typically form benzoic acids. So the methyl group would oxidize. But wait, the nitro group is a meta director. Wait, no, in oxidation, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So when toluene is nitrated, the methyl is activating, so nitration occurs para. Then, when you oxidize the methyl group (which is now para to nitro), the oxidation would turn the methyl into a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait, toluene is methylbenzene. When you nitrate, you add a nitro group. Then, when you oxidize the methyl group (which is already activated in the para position), under strong acidic conditions with Mn
