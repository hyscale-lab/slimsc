Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is given with rows (0, -i) and (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and then determine which of the given options is correct.

Hmm, first, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the components like S_x, S_y, S_z are related to spin matrices. Since this is a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, the spin matrices should be 2x2 in this case.

Wait, the matrix S given is:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So S here is the Pauli Y matrix.

So the operator A_y is c multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. Since c is h/(4π), let me write that out.

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

Let me write down A_y. Let's compute A_y:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So each element of the matrix is multiplied by h/(4π). Let's denote c = h/(4π) for simplicity, so A_y = c * S.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

The Pauli Y matrix S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. Wait, wait. Wait, let me think. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply by c, which is (h/(4π)), the eigenvalues would be c * (±1), right?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, because the Pauli matrices σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So if A_y is c * σ_y, then the eigenvalues would be c * (+1) and c * (-1).

So the eigenvalues of A_y are ± c. Since c is h/(4π), that would be ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, I think I'm mixing up units here. Because for spin, the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, but in this problem, S is given as the matrix. Let me see.

Wait, in the problem statement, S is the matrix:
Row 1: 0   -i
Row 2: i   0
Which is exactly the Pauli Y matrix. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, so its eigenvalues are ±1. Therefore, when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y
