Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, especially spin, the components of the angular momentum are represented by matrices. Since S is a 2x2 matrix, it's probably related to the Pauli matrices, which are used for spin-½ particles. Wait, the muon has spin 1/2, right? So this must be the spin angular momentum.

So, the Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is given here for S. Let me write that out. 

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

Wait a second, isn't that the form of the Pauli matrix σy? Let me confirm. The standard Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i,  0]]

σz = [[1, 0],
       [0, -1]]

Yes, so S is σy. So Ay = c * σy, and c is h/(4π). 

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator is often written as ħ S, where S is dimensionless. Because ħ is h/(2π). Let me check: ħ = h/(2π). So in this case, c is h/(4π) = (ħ)/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. 

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So substituting, (ħ/2) σy φ = a φ. So the eigenvalues a should be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of σy. What are the eigenvalues of σy?

Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Let
