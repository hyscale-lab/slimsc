Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, wait, in our universe, magnets are dipoles, right? They have both a north and south pole. And I remember that one of Maxwell's equations relates to the divergence of the magnetic field. Oh right, the one that says the divergence of B is zero. That equation is because magnetic monopoles don't exist in our world. So if in this universe they do have isolated poles, that equation must change.

Wait, what are Maxwell's equations again? Let me think.

1. Gauss's Law for electricity: divergence of E is rho over epsilon.
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B is zero. Oh yeah, that's the one that would change if magnetic monopoles exist.
3. Faraday's Law: curl of E is negative the time derivative of B.
4. Ampere's Law (with Maxwell's addition): curl of H is J plus displacement current.

So in our universe, equation 2 is div B = 0. If you have monopoles, then div B wouldn't be zero. So equation 2 would change. But what about the other equations?

Wait, the question is asking which equations are different. So the main change would be in the magnetic Gauss's Law. Are there other equations that might be affected? Like, if there are monopoles, would that affect Ampere's Law or Faraday's Law?

From what I recall, introducing magnetic monopoles would require modifying two of Maxwell's equations. Because currently, the divergence of B is zero, and the curl of E is related to dB/dt. If you have monopoles, then divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. And because of charge conservation, Faraday's Law might also change.

Wait, wait. Let's think. In our equations, the curl of E is -dB/dt. If there are magnetic charges, then perhaps the time derivative isn't enoughâ€”maybe there's a current term involved. Like, similar to how Ampere's Law includes a current, maybe Faraday's Law would have a term involving the magnetic current.

So, in that case, both the Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B) and Faraday's Law (curl E) would change. So which options correspond to that.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Only the divergence of B. So this would be incorrect if
