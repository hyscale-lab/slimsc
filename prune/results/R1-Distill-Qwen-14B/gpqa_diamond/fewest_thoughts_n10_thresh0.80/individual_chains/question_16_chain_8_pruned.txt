Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So I need to check each of these compounds to see if they have any chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry.

Let me look at each one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double-bonded. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Wait, no, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would be on the second carbon. Oh wait, wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, no, but wait, but-1-ene has four carbons. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with Cl on C1 and CH3 on C2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would make the structure CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would have Cl on C1. So it's Cl-CH2-C(H)=CH2? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl on C1, which is double-bond
