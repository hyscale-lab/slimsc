Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about an experiment where compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify what Compound X was from the options provided.

First, I should probably understand what the reaction is doing. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I remember that this is a commonly used reagent in the formation of epoxides. It's a cyclic amine, and when it reacts with a carbonyl group, it can form an epoxide, or oxirane ring. So the reaction is likely an epoxidation of a double bond.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a base, or maybe a catalyst, but in some cases, it's part of the epoxidation process. Oh right! That's the reagent used in the Prilezhaev epoxidation. It reacts with peracids to form epoxides, but wait, maybe in some cases, it's used in other ways. Alternatively, perhaps the compound X has a ketone group which is being epoxidized. Hmm, but epoxidation usually targets alkenes, not ketones. Wait, no. Wait, epoxidation is the process where a peracid reacts with an alkene to form an epoxide. So if compound X is a diene or something else, but in this case, the reagent might be part of a different reaction.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's about an epoxide ring-opening. Wait, but the product's NMR shows an epoxide, perhaps? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl group, and this reagent is used to form an epoxide by some mechanism. Hmm.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. Let me look at the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So in the proton NMR, there are two singlets at around 2.2-2.3 ppm, each 3H. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something deshielded, maybe an electronegative atom or part of an aromatic ring. Since they're singlets, the protons are not split, so maybe each is attached to a carbon that's not adjacent to any other protons. Like maybe a methyl attached to an oxygen in an epoxide, or maybe a methyl substituted on an aromatic ring.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm, that looks like a substituent on a benzene ring, maybe a para-substituted group with some coupling.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If the aromatic signals are split into four groups: a doublet (1H), another doublet (2H), another doublet (1H), and another doublet (2H), perhaps it's a para-substituted styrene structure. Let me visualize a benzene ring with a substituent that's an epoxide, maybe.

Wait, styryl groups are vinyl groups attached to a benzene ring. So, if the starting material was a styryl compound, and it was epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring.

Wait, but the options given are all epoxides
