Okay, so I need to figure out the IUPAC name of this benzene ring structure based on the description. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the information given.

First, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde (which is the formyl group), and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Wait, meta means they are each separated by one carbon, right? So if I imagine the benzene ring, these three groups are each at positions that are three apart. But wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So if three substituents are meta to each other, that's a bit tricky because each would be separated by two carbons. Wait, no. Let me think again. If two substituents are meta, they are on positions 1 and 3. But when three substituents are all meta to each other, it's a bit confusing. Maybe each is two positions apart? Or perhaps I should think about their relative positions based on other substituents.

Wait, the question says they are meta to one another. So each is in a meta position relative to the others. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps they form a trio where each is meta to the next, but that might not be possible on a benzene ring. Maybe the three substituents are arranged in such a way that each is meta to one another. Wait, perhaps they're placed at positions 1, 3, and 5? Because that's every other carbon, which would make them meta to each other. Yeah, because in a benzene ring, position 1 is meta to 3, 3 is meta to 5, and 5 is meta to 1. So those three groups—carboxylic acid, formyl, and cyano—are at positions 1, 3, and 5. But wait, wait. The question also mentions other substituents.

Next, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, wait, the carboxylic acid is one substituent. Ortho to it (so positions 2 and 6) are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, position 2 has either hydroxyl or dimethylamino, and position 6 has the other. But which is where? Let's see. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is position 4. So the substituents are:

- Position 1: carboxylic acid (COOH)
- Position 4: methoxy (OCH3)
- Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6): hydroxyl (OH) and dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
- And the three meta substituents are COOH, formyl (CHO), and cyano (CN). Wait, no—the initial statement says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So, the formyl and cyano are also meta to each other. So, perhaps the formyl is at position 3 and cyano at position 5, or vice versa.

Wait, let me try to map this out. Let's assign positions:

Imagine the benzene ring with positions 1 through 6 in a circle.

- Position 1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
- Para to COOH is position 4: OCH3 (methoxy)
- Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are OH and N(CH3)2. Let's say position 2 is OH and position 6 is N(CH3)2.

Now, the other substituents: formyl and cyano groups are meta to each other and also meta to the COOH. So COOH is at 1, so meta to that would be positions 3 and 5. Wait, no: meta to 1 is 3 and 5, but meta to each other as well. So formyl and cyano are at 3 and 5. Either way.

So, positions 3 and 5: one is formyl (CHO), the other is cyano (CN). Also, the methoxy is at 4.

Additionally, the methoxy (position 4) and the hydroxyl (position 2) are both ortho to the nitrile. The nitrile is at either 3 or 5.

Wait, let's see. The nitrile is at position 3. So, ortho to it would be positions 2 and 4. Position 2 has OH, and position 4 has OCH3. So both are ortho to the nitrile. That fits.

So, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

Wait, but let me check the meta positions. COOH is at 1. CHO is at 5, which is meta to 1 (distance of 4, which is equivalent to meta). Similarly, CN is at 3, which is also meta to 1. So the formyl and cyano are at positions 5 and 3, respectively. Now, the formyl (CHO) is at 5. Its meta positions are 1 and 3. Since 1 is COOH, which is meta, and 3 is CN, which is meta to both COOH and CHO. So that works.

Now, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

So the order of numbering starts with the functional group with the highest priority. Wait, in IUPAC nomenclature, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority. The order of priority is: carboxylic acid (highest), then aldehyde, then nitrile, then ether, then alcohol, etc. So the carboxylic acid is the primary functional group here. So we number the ring so that the COOH is at position 1.

So the numbering is as above. So the substituents are:

Position 1: COOH (becomes the suffix, so the base name is benzoic acid)

Position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino group)

Now, the substituents are numbered in the order of their positions. The priority of substituents is determined by alphabetical order, but when numbering, the substituents are assigned the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, wait, the substituent order in the name is based on the alphabetical order of their prefixes, but when assigning numbers, they're arranged to get the lowest set of numbers.

Wait, no. The substituents are ordered alphabetically, but their positions are determined based on the numbering that gives the lowest possible numbers.

So, let's list the substituents with their positions:

Position 2: OH (hydroxyl)

Position 3: CN (cyano)

Position 4: OCH3 (methoxy)

Position 5: CHO (formyl)

Position 6: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)

Wait, but how does the numbering go? The carboxylic acid is at 1, so that's fixed.

So, substituents at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

Now, the substituents are: OH (2), CN (3), OCH3 (4), CHO (5), N(CH3)2 (6).

In the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their position. Wait, no, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but the numbering is such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. But the main chain or the main ring's numbering is fixed with the principal functional group.

So, the substituents are:

- dimethylamino (position 6)

- formyl (position 5)

- cyano (position 3)

- hydroxyl (position 2)

- methoxy (position 4)

So, the substituents in alphabetical order would be:

cyano (CN), dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

Wait, no. The substituents are named as prefixes, and their order is alphabetical. So, the substituents are:

CN (cyano), OCH3 (methoxy), OH (hydroxyl), N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino), CHO (formyl).

Wait, let me list the substituent names:

- cyano → "cyano"

- dimethylamino → "dimethylamino"

- formyl → "formyl"

- hydroxyl → "hydroxy"

- methoxy → "methoxy"

So, alphabetical order would be based on the substituent's prefix:

C comes before D, before F, before H, before M.

So the order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So substituents are, in the name: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, no, wait. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the name, but their positions in the numbering determine their order in the name. Wait, no, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the substituent with the prefix that comes first alphabetically is listed first, followed by the next, etc.

So, the substituents in alphabetical order would be:

1. Cyano (C)

2. Dimethylamino (D)

3. Formyl (F)

4. Hydroxy (H)

5. Methoxy (M)

So the name would start with benzoic acid, then the substituents in the order cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

But wait, each substituent is prefixed with their position number. So, for each substituent, their position is written before their name. But the substituent with the earliest position number is listed first in the name. Or is it the alphabetical order of the substituent's name that dictates the order in the name, regardless of the position numbers?

Wait, no. In IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their position on the ring. So, the order in the name is determined by the alphabetical order of their names, not their positions.

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up some rules. Let me check. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So, the substituent whose prefix comes first in the alphabet is listed first in the name.

So in this case, the substituents are:

- 2-hydroxy

- 3-cyano

- 4-methoxy

- 5-formyl

- 6-dimethylamino

But in the name, they would be listed in alphabetical order of their prefixes, which would be:

cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the name would start with "3-cyano", then "5-formyl", then "6-dimethylamino", then "2-hydroxy", then "4-methoxy".

Wait, but that's not correct because the substituent positions might have lower numbers, but in the name, their order is determined by the alphabetical order of their prefixes.

Wait, perhaps I should write the substituents with their positions and then sort them alphabetically.

So each substituent is:

- cyano (position 3)

- dimethylamino (position 6)

- formyl (position 5)

- hydroxy (position 2)

- methoxy (position 4)

So, in alphabetical order:

1. cyano (C)

2. dimethylamino (D)

3. formyl (F)

4. hydroxy (H)

5. methoxy (M)

So the order is cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Thus, the substituents in the name would be listed as 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but wait, the name is written as the main chain (benzoic acid) followed by substituents in alphabetical order. So the substituent names are prefixed with their position numbers, but the order in the name is alphabetical.

So the substituents in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl, 2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Putting it all together, the name would be: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, but wait, the order in the name is based on substituent alphabet, so it would be:

3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino, 2-hydroxy.

No, no, wait. The substituents are:

3-cyano

2-hydroxy

4-methoxy

5-formyl

6-dimethylamino

But when arranged alphabetically, the order is cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So in the name:

3-cyano, then dimethylamino, which is at 6, then formyl (5), then hydroxy (2), then methoxy (4).

So the substituents in the name are written in the order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the substituents in the name are:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl, 2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

So the full name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, the order in the name is alphabetical, so in option B, the substituents are listed as hydroxy first, then cyano, which would not be correct because "cyano" comes before "hydroxy".

Wait, the correct order in the name would be cyano, then dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So let's look at the options.

Option A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That fits the order: cyano (3), dimethylamino (6), formyl (5), hydroxy (2), methoxy (4). But wait, the order in the name is the substituents ordered alphabetically, so the numbers don't necessarily have to be in order. The substituent names are in alphabetical order, but their positions are fixed.

Wait, but the substituents in the name are written in alphabetical order, regardless of their position. So, for example, 3-cyano comes before 6-dimethylamino because 'cyano' comes before 'dimethylamino' alphabetically.

So the substituents in option A are listed in the correct alphabetical order. Let's check each option.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy.

So substituents in the order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. Yes, correct.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino).

Here, the order is hydroxy first, which is incorrect because 'cyano' comes before 'hydroxy' alphabetically.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxy.

Here, the order is dimethylamino first, which is incorrect.

Option D:5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxy.

Order: cyano first, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, then methoxy. So the order is correct. Wait, let's see:

The substituents in D: 5-cyano, 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 6-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Wait, but the substituent order should be cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. So in D, the order is cyano, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, then methoxy. But wait, the substituent in D is 5-cyano, which is position 5. But in our structure, cyano is at position 3. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but looking back, in our structure, the substituents are:

Position 3: CN

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: N(CH3)2

So option A is 3-cyano, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino, which matches. So the substituents are correctly placed in option A.

But wait, the substituent order in the name is alphabetical, not positional. So in option A, the substituents are ordered as cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. But in the actual structure, the substituents are:

Position 2: hydroxy

Position 3: cyano

Position 4: methoxy

Position 5: formyl

Position 6: dimethylamino

So when the substituents are listed in the name, their position numbers are part of their substituent name, but the order in the name is based on the substituent's prefix. So regardless of their position, the substituents are listed in the order of their names.

So the correct substituent order in the name is:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Looking at option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. That's the correct order because it's cyano first, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, then methoxy.

Wait, but in the substituent order, after cyano comes dimethylamino, which is correct. So option A is correct.

Alternatively, option B starts with hydroxy, which is incorrect. So the correct answer is option A.


To determine the correct IUPAC name of the molecule, we analyze the substituents on the benzene ring based on their positions and prioritize them alphabetically.

### Substituent Positions:
1. **Carboxylic acid (COOH)** is at position 1 (assigned as the principal functional group).
2. **Methoxy (OCH₃)** is at position 4 (para to COOH).
3. **Hydroxyl (OH)** is at position 2 (ortho to COOH).
4. **Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)** is at position 6 (ortho to COOH).
5. **Cyano (CN)** is at position 3 (meta to COOH and ortho to OH and OCH₃).
6. **Formyl (CHO)** is at position 5 (meta to COOH and meta to CN).

### Substituent Alphabetical Order:
The substituents are listed alphabetically based on their prefixes:
1. **Cyano (CN)**.
2. **Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)**.
3. **Formyl (CHO)**.
4. **Hydroxyl (OH)**.
5. **Methoxy (OCH₃)**.

### Substituent Positions in the Name:
Each substituent is prefixed with its position number:
- **3-cyano** (CN at position 3).
- **6-dimethylamino** (N(CH₃)₂ at position 6).
- **5-formyl** (CHO at position 5).
- **2-hydroxy** (OH at position 2).
- **4-methoxy** (OCH₃ at position 4).

### Final IUPAC Name:
The name is constructed by combining the base name **benzoic acid** with the substituents in alphabetical order:
**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Matches the correct substituent order and positions.
- **Option B**: Incorrect order, as hydroxy comes before cyano alphabetically.
- **Option C**: Incorrect order, as dimethylamino comes before cyano alphabetically.
- **Option D**: Incorrect substituent placement (e.g., cyano at position 5 instead of 3).

### Correct Answer:
**Option A**: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Answer: A
