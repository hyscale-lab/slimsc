Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) when using the VLT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-precision spectroscopy, right? It's on the VLT, which is a big telescope. The question says a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

So, I need to figure out which of these stars meet that S/N condition. I think the S/N depends on the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude) because fainter stars will have lower S/N. Brighter stars mean more photons, so higher S/N.

Each option gives some details about the star. Let's go through them one by one.

Option a) Canopus. I know Canopus is a very bright star, probably one of the brightest in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.7, I think. That's super bright, so it should definitely be detectable. S/N would be way higher than 10.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. I'm not exactly sure of its apparent magnitude, but I think it's around 2 or so. Let me recall... Oh wait, I think Polaris is about magnitude 2. But wait, actually, I think it's brighter. Maybe around 1.8 to 2.0. Either way, it's a fairly bright star, so it should also be detectable. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. I think some sources say it's about magnitude 2, but maybe it's a bit brighter. Either way, let's note this as possibly detectable.

Option c) Star with V magnitude 15, 10 pc away. Wait, no. Wait, the absolute magnitude is given. Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) the star would have at 10 pc. So if M is 15, then at 10 pc, m is 15. But wait, the star is 10 pc away, so m = M + 5*(log10(d) - 1). Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5, where d is in parsecs.

So for option c, M=15, d=10 pc. So m =15 +5*(1) -5 =15+5-5=15. So apparent magnitude is 15. That's very faint. I think ESPRESSO can detect very faint stars, but I'm not sure about the exact limit.

Wait,ESPRESSO's performance depends on the exposure time and the brightness of the star. The S/N increases with the brightness. For a 1-hour exposure, a star with m=15 might be too faint
