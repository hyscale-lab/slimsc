Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question has two reactions, and I need to find the suitable reagents A and B from the options given. Let's break down each reaction.

First reaction: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? That's a ketone. Adding NaCN, which I think is a nitrile group source, maybe via nucleophilic addition.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's typically a nucleophilic addition, but under what conditions? I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps. Oh, right! The formation of cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrin formation occurs when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide in an acidic environment. So the reaction would produce a compound with both a hydroxyl and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which fits that structure. So reagent A must be providing the acidic conditions. Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, like sulfuric acid, maybe. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a mild acid but also a source of sulfites. Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent A is part of the reaction with NaCN. So, the first step is adding NaCN and then A.

Wait, but I think the cyanohydrin formation usually uses a strong acid, like H2SO4 or H3O+ (like in an acidic aqueous solution). So for A, the reagent would be an acid. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So, the first reagent A is probably H3O+ because that's the acid needed. So option A or B for the first part.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. The common reagents for this are strong oxidizing agents. For example, under acidic conditions, KMnO4 or another strong oxidizing agent. Alternatively, using HCl as a catalyst with air or other oxidizing conditions.

Wait, in the presence of water, perhaps. So the reaction is nitrile â†’ carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group is being oxidized. What reagents are used for that?

Another possibility: The nitrile could undergo hydrolysis, but that would typically form an amide or carboxylic acid under different conditions. Wait, but
