Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectral data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Alright, let's start by looking at each piece of data and see what each tells me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The peaks are at 3000 cm-1 (very broad), 1700, and 1650. Hmm, FTIR is all about functional groups. The broad peak around 3000 likely indicates O-H stretching. Wait, because a broad peak in that region is usually either from an alcohol (maybe) or a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols have broad O-H stretches, but carboxylic acids are even broader. But wait, the other two peaks: 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, so maybe an conjugated carbonyl or something else. Oh, wait, for example, maybe an ester has a carbonyl around 1700, and maybe an aromatic ring (like in a conjugated carbonyl), but wait, 1650 could also be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with a double bond nearby. Or maybe it's an amide, but no, the options don't have nitrogen here. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1600. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, another thought: if the compound has both a carbonyl group and an adjacent double bond, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. That could explain the lower wavenumber for the carbonyl, so 1700 and 1650 might be the carbonyl and the adjacent C=C. Because in such a case, conjugation lowers the carbonyl's stretching frequency. So maybe the molecule has an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring. But I'm not sure yet.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, usually as a triplet or quartet if adjacent to another CH2 group, but more importantly, their presence suggests there's a double bond in the structure. So the compound likely has an alkene group. Also, the FTIR's 1650 peak could be the C=C stretch.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a key mass. Let me think: possible fragments. 45 could be a methyl group attached to something else? Or maybe a (CH2)2O
