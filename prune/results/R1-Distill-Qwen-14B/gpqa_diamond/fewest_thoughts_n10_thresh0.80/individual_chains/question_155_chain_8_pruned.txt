Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about operators and uncertainties. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that an operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So that means the state vectors are expressed in terms of Pz's eigenstates.

The system is found in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz of Pz.

Wait, right. The uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

But wait, since the state is given in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors, maybe this simplifies things. Because in that basis, the expectation value of Pz would be straightforward.

Let me think: The state is a vector in the Pz basis. So each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of Pz. Let me check the matrix of Pz. Oh right, Pz's matrix is diagonal. The first row has ħ, the second 0, third -ħ.

So the eigenvalues of Pz are ħ, 0, -ħ. So each component in our state corresponds to one of these values, weighted by the amplitude in that state.

The given state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write this as a column vector, so each entry is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate of Pz.

So the state can be written as |ψ⟩ = a|Pz=ħ⟩ + b|Pz=0⟩ + c|Pz=−ħ⟩, where a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

To compute ⟨Pz⟩, it's the expectation value, which is a*(ħ)*a* + b*0 + c*(-ħ)*c*. Wait, no, more accurately, for each component, the eigenvalue is multiplied by the square of the amplitude's magnitude. Because the expectation value is the sum of |amplitude|^2 times the eigenvalue.

So let's compute ⟨Pz⟩:

⟨Pz⟩ = |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Compute each |amplitude|^2:

|a|^2 is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|b|^2 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

|c|^2 is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So substituting:

⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4) * ħ + (0) * (1/2) + (1/4) * (-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

Oh, so the expectation value of Pz is zero. So the first term in the uncertainty would involve that.

Next, compute ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz² is just the square of the operator, but since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is also diagonal, with each eigenvalue squared.

So the eigenvalues for Pz are ħ, 0, -ħ. So Pz squared has eigenvalues ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ would be |a|^2 * ħ² + |b|^2 * 0² + |c|^2 * ħ².

Which is (1/4) ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0² ) = sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure. Because I'm calculating ⟨Pz²⟩ as the sum of |amplitudes|^2 multiplied by the square of the eigenvalues. Since the eigenvalues are squared, that's correct.

So the uncertainty ΔPz is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state given by the column vector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix. The state can be written as:

\[
| \psi \rangle = a | P_z = \hbar \rangle + b | P_z = 0 \rangle + c | P_z = -\hbar \rangle,
\]

where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. The probabilities (squared magnitudes of the amplitudes) are:
