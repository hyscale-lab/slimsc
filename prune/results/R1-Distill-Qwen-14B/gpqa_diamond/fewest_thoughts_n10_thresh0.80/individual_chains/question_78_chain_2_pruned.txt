Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the potentials in electromagnetism, specifically scalar and vector potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they generate both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's a vector d from the point where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at that earlier time tr is v. So, I need to find expressions for the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Each gives expressions for V and A. I remember that the scalar potential for a static charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r), which looks familiar. But when the charge is moving, things change because of the motion affecting the potentials.

I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is modified because of time delays and the relative motion. Oh right, the retarded time comes into play. The scalar potential involves a term like (q/(4πε₀)) times some denominator involving the distance and velocity. And the vector potential is proportional to the velocity multiplied by the scalar potential.

Wait, the general form for scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(r - (v/c²)(t - t_r)) ] or something like that. Or maybe it's considering the vector d. Let me think.

Wait, the vector d is from the charge's position at time tr to the field point r. So, the charge was at some point, and d is the vector from there to r. So the distance would be |d|, but considering the motion, there might be a term involving the dot product of d and v.

In the scalar potential, I think it's (q c) divided by (4 π ε₀ (d c - v · d)). Or wait, maybe it's (d c + v · d) in the denominator. Let me get this straight.

The scalar potential when the charge is moving is given by V = (q/(
