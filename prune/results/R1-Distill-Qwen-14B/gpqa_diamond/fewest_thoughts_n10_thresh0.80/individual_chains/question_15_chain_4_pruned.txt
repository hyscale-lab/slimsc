Alright, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Okay, let's think about what I remember about transiting planets and the factors that influence the probability of a transit happening.

Transit probability depends on the orbital configuration. Specifically, for a planet to transit its star from our point of view, its orbital plane needs to be edge-on. But how do we calculate the probability of that happening?

I remember that the probability (P) of a planet transiting is approximately given by the formula P â‰ˆ (R_star + R_planet) / a, where R_star is the star's radius, R_planet is the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star. Wait, but that might be an approximation. Alternatively, I think it's the ratio of the size of the star plus the planet to the semi-major axis. But wait, the planet's size is much smaller than the star, so maybe R_planet is negligible, so it's roughly (R_star) / a times something else. Hmm, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Wait, another approach: the probability of transit is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit sweeps. Wait, or perhaps the probability is (r_star/a)^2, but I think that's for a coplanar orbit. No, wait. The actual formula is a bit more precise. The probability can be approximated as (R_star / a) when the orbit is randomly oriented, because the
