Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let's see what it says. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both pH values and match them.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form acetate ions and water. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na+ + H2O.

First, let's think about the initial solution after dilution. The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M in 20 cm³. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because volume doubles. So 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. So now the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that precisely. Initial moles of acetic acid: Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. Diluting with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water makes total volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next step: Titration with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration? That means 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. So let me calculate how much NaOH is needed for equivalence first, because maybe that helps.

At equivalence point: moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question says 25% titration. So that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So during the titration, at 25%
