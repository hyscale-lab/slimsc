Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, the question says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of the stars meet this criterion.

I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used on the VLT, and it's designed for high-resolution spectroscopy. But how does that translate into detecting certain stars? I think it has to do with the brightness of the star because if a star is too dim, the S/N might be too low.

The key here is calculating the S/N ratio for each star. I recall that the S/N for an astronomical object depends on the telescope's collecting area, the exposure time, and the object's brightness. The formula I think is S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time * number of pixels) / (read noise + other noises?), but maybe that's more detailed than needed.

Wait, wait. Absolute magnitude might be a better starting point. Absolute magnitude tells how bright a star is intrinsically. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of about 4.8. Canopus is a bright star, I think. Polaris is also bright but maybe not as much as Canopus.

The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) - 5 log10(d0), where d is the distance and d0 is 10 pc. Alternatively, m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So for each star, knowing the absolute magnitude (given as 15 in some cases) and the distance, I can calculate the apparent magnitude.

But wait, the V magnitude of the star affects how much flux we receive. The flux received from a star is given by the formula: f = f0 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m is apparent magnitude, m0 is some reference magnitude, and f0 is the reference flux.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the relation between absolute magnitude and lumin
