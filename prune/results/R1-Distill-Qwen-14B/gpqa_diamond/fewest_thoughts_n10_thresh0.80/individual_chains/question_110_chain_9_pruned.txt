Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as it appears to us is the apparent magnitude, which depends on its intrinsic brightness (absolute magnitude) and its distance. Also, there's interstellar extinction which makes stars appear dimmer and redder, so that affects the apparent magnitude too.

The question gives me five stars, each with different parameters. The key is to find out the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering extinction if necessary, and then see which ones are brighter than the thresholds for both instruments.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. Since absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 pc, then at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is the same as absolute, so 15.5 mag. Now, since it's exactly 10 pc, there's no distance modulus beyond that. But does it have extinction? I don't see E(B-V) given, so maybe no extinction? So apparent V is 15.5. 

ESPRESSO can observe up to 17 mag. So 15.5 is brighter than 17, so detectable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can go up to 16 mag. 15.5 is brighter than 16? Wait no, 15.5 is brighter than 16, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So 15.5 is brighter than 16, so it's detectable by HIRES as well. Wait, but wait: if the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is fainter than 16? No, 15.5 is brighter than 16. Because higher magnitude numbers mean dimmer. So 15.5 is brighter than 16, so it's within both's detectable range. So Star1 can be detected by both. But wait, wait, I think I need to double-check.

Wait, the question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star is brighter than 17, meaning its magnitude is less than 17. So Star1 has 15.5, which is less than 17, so yes, detectable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so Star1's 15.5 is also brighter than 16, so detectable by HIRES. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc. Wait, but wait: absolute mag isn't given here. Oh, no, Star2 doesn't have absolute mag; its apparent mag is given. So no need to calculate. But does it have extinction? No, because E(B-V) isn't mentioned, so I think we can assume no extinction. So apparent mag is 16.5. 

ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so 1
