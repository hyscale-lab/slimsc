Hmmm, okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, to be detected by both, a star must have a V magnitude that's brighter than the brighter of these two limits. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the brighter the star (smaller magnitude number), the easier it is to detect. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, that means V < 17. For HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so V <16. So to be detected by both, the star's V must be <16, because if it's between 16 and 17, HIRES can't detect it because it's fainter than 16, but ESPRESSO can. So the star has to be V <16 mag to be detected by both.

Wait, wait, no, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So, that means apparent V <=17? Or brighter than, meaning apparent V <17? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star has apparent V magnitude of 16, that's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars with V <16.

So for a star to be seen by both, it must have V <16, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so anything brighter than 17 (which includes up to 16) will be observed by both.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. Let's clarify. The question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So stars with V <17 can be observed. Because if a star is brighter than 1
