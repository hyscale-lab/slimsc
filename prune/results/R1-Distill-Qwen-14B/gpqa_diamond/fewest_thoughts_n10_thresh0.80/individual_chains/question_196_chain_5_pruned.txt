Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. The setup is a one-dimensional oscillator, so it's moving back and forth on a line. The mass is m, the amplitude is A, and it obeys Hooke's law, which means the force is F = -kx. The problem is asking for the maximum speed, v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kA², and that equals (1/2)m v_max². Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't use that approach.

Right, in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; it's total energy. The total energy of the oscillator would include both the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy from the spring. So, I need to set up an equation where the total energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement (where all energy is potential).

The potential energy in the spring is (1/2)k x², right? At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². The kinetic energy, in relativity, is (gamma - 1) m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but I think I need to set the total energy equal to the sum of these. So at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic, and at x=A, all is potential. But wait, actually, in the oscillator, energy is conserved, so the total energy should be the same whether the mass is at x=0 (max speed) or x=A (zero speed, but in reality, in relativity, x=0 would have max kinetic energy).

Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². So when x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. But wait, no—it's the other way around. At x=A, the mass
