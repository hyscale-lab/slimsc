Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess we need to consider special relativity effects here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass m with maximum amplitude A. The options involve expressions with c, the speed of light, so I'm thinking relativistic effects must be significant here.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But since this is relativistic, the non-relativistic formula might not hold.

Relativistically, the energy isn't just kinetic; total energy includes rest mass energy. The total energy E of a particle is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So E = gamma mc². But in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but wait, this question is classical, right? Because it's considering maximum speed, not quantum states.

Wait, so in a classical relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is
