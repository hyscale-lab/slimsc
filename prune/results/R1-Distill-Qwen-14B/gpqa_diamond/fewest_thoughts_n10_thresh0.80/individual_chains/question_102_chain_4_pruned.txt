Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let's start by reading through the problem carefully.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments, and the result is that there's no green signal when they visualize the mice. I need to figure out why that's happening.

Let me break down the information given.

First, the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. So, both are proteins; ligand probably binds to the receptor.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the vector probably has ligand first, then receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's constitutive. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for internal translation initiation. So, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES probably allows for the receptor to be expressed as well, perhaps in a different cell type or condition.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Wait, loxP sites are used in recombination. So, when Cre is present, it can excise the stop cassette.

So, the vector is set up so that in the absence of Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so only ligand is expressed (with mCherry), and the receptor might not be expressed unless the IRES is active. But with Cre, if the loxP sites are recombined, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the ligand and receptor to be co-expressed.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize the construct:

5' [CBA promoter] --> ligand ORF --> loxP stop loxP --> mCherry ORF
|
IRES
|
receptor ORF --> lox2272 stop lox2272 --> eGFP ORF

Wait, no, bicistronic usually has two ORFs in one transcript. So it's a single transcript with two ORFs. The first ORF (ligand) is under CBA, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF. Downstream of ligand is a stop cassette, and downstream of receptor is another stop cassette.

So, without Cre, the stop cassettes are present. So when the transcript is made, the ligand ORF is translated, then the stop cassette (with loxP) prevents translation of the downstream mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES, which might allow for some expression, but the stop cassette after receptor would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

But when Cre is introduced, it recombines the loxP sites, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

In the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, meaning the blot is working. So the proteins are being expressed? But when they breed the mouse model homozygous for the construct (so both alleles have the same), and then cross them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the offspring are visualized under confocal, but no green signal (eGFP) is seen.

Wait, why no eGFP? eGFP is fused to the receptor. So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, but why?

Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the problem is about why the GFP isn't showing. If they're expressed in the same cell, then why wouldn't GFP be visible? Not sure how this option explains the result.

Option B: receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence under the microscope. But the question is about whether the construct is expressed in the first place. The Western blot probably uses cell lysates, so if the protein is made but not secreted, the blot would detect it. But the question says the Western was done on total proteins, and the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests the proteins are being expressed. So maybe the eGFP is being expressed, but not in the right place (like stuck in ER or Golgi, so not on the surface). But why wouldn't the Western show it? Because the Western is total proteins, so even if it's stuck in Golgi, it would be in the lysate. So this might not explain the lack of signal.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The enhancer would be needed for expression in a specific tissue. In the mouse model, the construct is under CBA promoter for ligand, which is constitutive. The IRES is for the receptor. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the
