Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The process is gamma plus gamma annihilating into electron-positron pairs, right? The question is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. 

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a particle is related to its energy and the probability of interactions. So if the gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons, their lifetime would depend on how often they interact. When the interaction rate becomes significant compared to the expansion of the universe, their lifetime is limited by this process.

Wait, the CMB has an average photon energy of 1e-3 eV. So each CMB photon is low energy. The gamma-rays in question are high energy, so their energy is much higher than the CMB photons. 

I think the interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target photons. The cross-section for pair production via two-photon interaction probably depends on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. 

The annihilation process is gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-. So each gamma-ray can annihilate with a CMB photon. The probability of this happening depends on the photon density and the cross-section for the reaction. 

The mean free time (time until first interaction) for the gamma-ray would be the inverse of the interaction rate. The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be determined by this mean free time. If the mean free time is shorter than the age of the universe, then the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process.

So the formula for the mean free time tau is tau = 1 / (n_photon * sigma), where n_photon is the number density of CMB photons, and sigma is the cross-section for the gamma-gamma reaction.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the cross-section formula. I remember that for pair production, the cross-section depends on the square of the logarithm of the energy ratio, perhaps? Or maybe it's a function of the center-of-mass energy. 

Let me think. The threshold for pair production is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the electron mass. But since one photon is from the CMB (E_photon ~ 1e-3 eV) and the other is high-energy (E_gamma), the center-of-mass energy would be roughly sqrt(E_gamma * E_photon). Wait, but for pair production, the required energy is 2*m_e*c^2, which is about 1.02 MeV. 

So for the annihilation to proceed, the combined energy of the two photons must be above this threshold. So sqrt(E_gamma * E_photon) should be greater than m_e c^2. Because in the center-of-mass frame, each photon has energy E_1 and E_2, so sqrt(E_1 * E_2) is the invariant mass. Wait, no, that's not right. The invariant mass squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 + p2)^2 c^2. But for two photons moving in opposite directions, the invariant mass squared is 4 E1 E2 (since their momenta are opposite). So the invariant mass is 2 sqrt(E1 E2). 

So for pair production, we need sqrt(E1 E2) >= m_e c^2. Since E1 is the CMB photon's energy (1e-3 eV), E2 is the gamma-ray's energy. So 2 sqrt(E_CMB * E_gamma) >= 2 m_e c^2. Dividing both sides by 2, sqrt(E_CMB * E_gamma) >= m_e c^2. Squaring both sides, E_CMB * E_gamma >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, E_CMB is 1e-3 eV, and m_e c^2 is about
