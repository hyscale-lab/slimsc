Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. There are different branches in this chain. The pp-I branch is the main one, I think, which produces helium-4. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which might handle different isotopes or steps. Oh right, pp-III probably deals with the boron-8 production, which is a significant source of neutrinos.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, that means the neutrinos we receive now wouldn't include those from that branch anymore, but the effect would be felt on Earth only after that time delay. So right now, neutrinos from the pp-III branch wouldn't be reaching us yet, but the ones from other branches or processes would still be coming.

But the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III branch contributes to these bands.

The pp-III branch produces boron-8, which then undergoes beta decay to become carbon-8, emitting a neutrino in the process. Boron-8's decay produces high-energy neutrinos. The energy of these neutrinos is around 15-20 MeV, if I'm not mistaken. So their energy is much higher than the bands we're considering (sub-MeV).

Wait, but what about other neutrino production processes? The main neutrino sources in the Sun are from the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch produces two protons and a helium-4, and emits two neutrinos (like the pep branch, but I think the main pp-I produces lower energy neutrinos). Alternatively, the pp-III branch is responsible for the boron-8, which then decays to carbon-8, emitting a neutrino. So the neutrinos from the main pp chain (pp-I) have lower energies than those from the
