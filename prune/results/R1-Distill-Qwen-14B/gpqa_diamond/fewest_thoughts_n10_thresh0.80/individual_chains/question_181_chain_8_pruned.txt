Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the sun, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. All other reactions are still happening. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux band1 over flux band2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing helium-4 from two protons and a helium-3. The main reaction is 2 protons + helium-3 â†’ helium-4 + two protons. This branch is significant because it's part of the cycle that contributes to the overall fusion in the Sun.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III is a step in the fusion process. If it stops, the other branches might still continue, but maybe some of the products get stuck. Wait, the pp-III branch is where two protons combine with a helium-3 nucleus to form helium-4. So without pp-III, that step doesn't happen. But then, what about the other branches?

Wait, the pp-II branch is when a deuterium nucleus (from pp-I) captures another proton to form tritium, which then decays into helium-3 and emits an electron and a neutrino. Oh right, so the pp-II produces helium-3. If pp-III is stopped, then the helium-3 can't combine to form helium-4 via the pp-III process. So the helium-3 would accumulate because it's not being consumed anymore.

But how does this affect neutrino production? Because the neutrinos in the Sun are mainly produced via the decay steps in the pp chain. For example, in the pp-I branch, a proton emits a positron and a neutrino to become a neutron, which then forms deuterium. Similarly, in the pp-II branch, the tritium nucleus decays into helium-3, emitting a
