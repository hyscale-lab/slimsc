Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, what does that mean? Wait, in our world, magnets always have both a north and south pole; you can't isolate them. But if in this universe they can have isolated poles, that must change some fundamental laws.

Maxwell's equations are four in total, right? They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. Let me remember what each equation is about.

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: It says that the divergence of the electric field E is proportional to the charge density. So, ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. This is about the sources of electric fields.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of the magnetic field B is zero, ∇·B = 0. This implies that magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) don't exist because the equation enforces that there are no magnetic charges. So if in this universe, they do exist, this law must change. So the second equation is definitely different.

3. Faraday's Law of Induction: It deals with the curl of the electric field. The equation is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This is about changing magnetic fields inducing electric fields. I'm not sure if this would change, but maybe not directly because it's about the induced electric fields regardless of monopoles.

4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition: This is about the curl of the magnetic field. The equation is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. Ampère's law relates the magnetic field around a current. But again, does the existence of monopoles change this? Hmm, not directly. Wait, but Ampère's law is about currents, which are moving charges. If monopoles exist, perhaps certain other aspects change, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question says which equations are different. So in our universe, because of the absence of magnetic monopoles, equations 2 and... any others? Let me think.

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, Gauss's law for magnetism would change. Because in our case, ∇·B = 0 implies no monopoles. So if there are monopoles, there would be a divergence of B proportional to the magnetic charge density. So that's equation 2.

But what about Ampère's law? Oh wait, in our equations, Ampère's law deals with the curl of B. But if magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect it? Or does it affect another equation?

Wait, let's think about the implications. If there are magnetic charges, then besides the modified Gauss law (equation 2), another equation might change. Because Maxwell's equations are a set that has to be consistent. So if equation 2 is changed, what else?

In our current setup:

Equation 1: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ → electric charge sources.

Equation 2: ∇·B = 0 → no magnetic monopoles.

Equation 3: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t → Faraday's law.

Equation 4: ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂
