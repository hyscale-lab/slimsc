Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, wait, the initial mass is M, and after fission, the two fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99M. That means some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, the mass defect leads to energy release.

They want to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So, I think I need to calculate T1 correctly using relativistic considerations and then compare it with the non-relativistic T1 to find the difference.

First, let's get the masses of the fragments. Let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m. Then the heavier one is 2m. So the sum is m + 2m = 3m. And this sum is 0.99M. So 3m = 0.99M → m = 0.99M /3= 0.33M. So the lighter fragment is 0.33M, and the heavier is 0.66M. So the rest masses are m1=0.66M and m2=0.33M.

Wait, but the initial nucleus has rest mass M, and after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99M. So the mass lost is 0.01M. That mass is converted into kinetic energy (and perhaps binding energy, but I think in this problem they're considering only kinetic energy as the released energy). So the total kinetic energy released would be the mass defect times c squared, but since we're dealing in GeV, units are probably handled in terms of mass-energy.

Wait, initial rest energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. Then the mass after fission is 0.99 M, so rest energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV.

But wait, that's the total energy, including the kinetic energy of both fragments. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.

In the center of mass frame, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, so their total momentum is zero. But when considering kinetic energy, in classical mechanics, it's easier to think in terms of velocities, but relativistically, the kinetic energy is more complicated.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. How to find T1 correctly?

Let me think about relativistic versus non-relativistic calculations.

In the non-relativistic case, when a mass splits into two parts, each moving with some speed,
