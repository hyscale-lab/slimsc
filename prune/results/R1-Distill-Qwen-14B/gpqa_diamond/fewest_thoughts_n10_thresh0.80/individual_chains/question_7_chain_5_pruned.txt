Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking: from what energy do gamma-rays have their lifetimes in the universe limited by the process gamma gamma → e+ e-? And the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their lifetime can be limited by processes like this. The idea is that if a gamma-ray has enough energy, it can annihilate with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. This process isn't possible for all energies, though. The energy has to be sufficient to create the rest mass of the particles involved.

Wait, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, right? So for pair production, the combined energy of the two photons needs to be at least twice that, since each electron has that rest mass. So that's 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's the threshold energy. So the gamma-ray and the CMB photon need to have a combined energy equal to this threshold.

But wait, photons are massless, so their energies are related by E = hf. Since both are photons, the energy depends on their frequencies. So for the gamma-ray of energy E1 and the CMB photon of energy E2, the condition is E1 + E2 ≥ 1.022 MeV. But the CMB photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV on average. Let me check that: 10^-3 eV is 0.001 eV, which is much lower than the electron rest mass. So you need the gamma-ray's energy plus 0.001 eV to be at least 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but 1.022 MeV is 1,022,000 eV. So E_gamma + 0.001 eV ≥ 1,022,000 eV. Since 0.001 is negligible compared to a million eV, the condition is approximately E_gamma ≥ ~1.022 MeV. But wait, that seems low. Why are the options all in GeV ranges?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps I need to consider the center-of-momentum frame or something more detailed. Like, perhaps the condition isn't just E1 + E2 ≥ 2m_e c^2, but involves the product and the frame of reference.

Wait, actually, the correct threshold condition for two photons to produce a pair is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-momentum frame is at least twice the electron rest mass. Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the invariant quantity s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2, where p is momentum. Since photons have E = pc, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 [since p1c = E1 and p2c = E2, so (p1c + p2c) is E1 + E2]?

Wait, no. Wait, the invariant s is the square of the total four-momentum. For two photons, their four-momenta add. So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (since the space components are vectors and can add up). But since photons are massless, E = |p| c, so for each photon, E1 = |p1| c and E2 = |p2| c.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Let's expand that
