Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a pretty complicated organic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to draw its structure in my mind. I think it's some sort of conjugated diene or maybe with multiple double bonds? Or perhaps it's a bicyclic structure? Wait, no, looking closer, I think it's a chain with two double bonds. Let me count the carbons. Each (CH3)2C= group is a substituent, maybe like a branching.

The problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom to make it a single atom in the gas phase. So for carbon, that's the energy needed to break all bonds in graphite or something? Not sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

Bond energies are provided for H-H (100 kJ/mol), C-C (200), C=C (300), and C-H (400). So each bond's strength is given.

Wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation, which is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For organics, like hydrocarbons, the formation would involve C and H2 gases forming the molecule.

The formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of all bonds broken] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds formed]

Wait, no, actually, I think it's the opposite. Because when bonds are broken, it's endothermic, and when formed, it's exothermic. So if I'm forming the molecule, I break the bonds in the reactants (elements) and form the bonds in the product. So the formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed)

Wait, in the formation reaction, we have the elements (like C and H2) breaking their bonds to form the compound. So for example, for methane, the reaction is C(graphite) + 2 H2 → CH4. The
