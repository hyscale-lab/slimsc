Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, I remember that when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the pH changes in certain ways. At the equivalence point, the solution is a salt of the weak acid and the strong base, so it will be basic. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps.

First, let's break down the problem. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. That dilutes the concentration of acetic acid.

Wait, right, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution is (0.05 M) * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Because 20 mL of 0.05 M and 20 mL of water makes 40 mL total. So the initial concentration is 0.025 M.

But wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 V1)/(V1 + V2). So M2 would be (0.05 * 20) / (20 + 20) = (1)/(40) = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the next part is the titration. We're adding 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is the pH at 25% titration. Oh, right, 25% of the equivalence point volume.

Wait, what's the equivalence point volume? Let's find that first. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% of that volume is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, no. Wait, in titration, 25% doesn't refer to the equivalence point volume, but to the amount added. For a 25%
