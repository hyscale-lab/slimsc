Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I should figure out the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Wait, when you mix two solutions, you can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol. Then 1 mmol / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So it's a 1:1 mole ratio.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of CH3COOH. Let's calculate how much NaOH is needed. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. So moles NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration. At this point, only a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted. So the moles of CH3COOH that have reacted is 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol.

So in the solution, the total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

The reaction will produce 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol, and the acetate is 0.00025 mol.

So the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait no, pKa is -log(Ka). So let me compute that. Log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is closer to 2, so pKa is around 4.73? Wait, wait, let me calculate exactly.

Ka = 1.85 x 10^-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's see, log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733, but since pKa is negative log, it's 4.733. So approximately 4.73.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.73 + log (0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253, which is around 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, but wait, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. The volume of solution is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). The moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So the solution is a sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic. The pH can be calculated by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. So Kb is 5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M, so the expression for Kb is ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^- ] = Kb.

Assuming x is small, we approximate [OH^-] ≈ x. So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02. x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but wait that's not matching any of the options. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Because when you have a solution of CH3COO^- in water, the pH is calculated using the hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, [OH^-] = x, [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3
