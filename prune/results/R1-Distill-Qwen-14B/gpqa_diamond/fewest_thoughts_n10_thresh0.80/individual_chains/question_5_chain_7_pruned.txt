Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators have eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which correspond to possible outcomes and states.

So, the operator P is a vector operator, probably like a spin operator. The components are given: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So the operator P is a vector operator, and its components are in the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right! The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Each is a 2x2 matrix. So Px is (ħ/2) * σx, same for Py and Pz but with σy and σz respectively.

The direction n is in the x-z plane. So it's a unit vector making some angle θ with the z-axis, I think. Say, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the operator P·n would be the dot product, which is Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz *n_z.

Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero, so Py doesn't contribute. So P·n = Px * sinθ + Pz * cosθ.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector n is (nx, ny, nz). Since it's in x-z plane, ny = 0. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator along n would be (P·n) = P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

But wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P·n is the component of P in the direction of n. So then, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So I need to find the eigenvector of the operator (P·n) for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

First, let's write down P·n. As I said, it's (Px * sinθ) + (Pz * cosθ) = (ħ/2) [ σx sinθ + σz cosθ ]

Let me compute the matrix form of this operator. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

σz = [[1, 0],
       [0, -1]]

So P·n becomes (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
                       [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Because when you multiply σx by sinθ and σz by cosθ, and add them:

σx * sinθ gives [[0, sinθ],[sinθ,0]]
σz * cosθ gives [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]
Adding them together gives [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by that.

Now, to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's denote the eigenvalue as λ = +ħ/2.

So the eigen equation is (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0.

So substituting λ, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ],
        [sinθ, -cosθ]] 
- (ħ/2) [[1, 0],
        [0, 1]]
=
(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1 , sinθ ],
         [ sinθ , -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ (cosθ -1), sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] ] 
*
[ v1 ]
[ v2 ]
= 0

But when solving for eigenvectors, we can ignore the multiplicative constants, so let me write the matrix without (ħ/2):

[ [ (cosθ -1), sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] ]

This matrix multiplied by the vector [v1; v2] equals zero.

So the equations are:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

These are two equations, but they should be linearly dependent since it's an eigenvalue problem. So let's take the first equation and solve for v2 in terms of v1.

From equation 1:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0 → v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1

Assuming sinθ ≠ 0, which it is because if sinθ is zero, then n is along z, but that's a different case. For now, let's proceed assuming sinθ isn't zero.

So v2 = [(1 - cosθ)/sinθ] v1.

We can write the eigenvector as [v1; (1 - cosθ)/(sinθ) v1 ].

Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar, let's set v1 = 1 for simplicity, but we need to normalize the vector.

So the vector is [1; (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ].

But let's compute (1 - cosθ)/sinθ. Using the identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] = [ sin(θ/2) ] / [ cos(θ/2) ) ] = tan(θ/2).

So, the vector becomes [1; tan(θ/2)].

Wait, but that's [1; tan(θ/2)] which can be written as [ cos(θ/2) ; sin(θ/2) ] if we factor something out. Wait, let's see.

Wait, [1; tan(θ/2)] = [ cos(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ; sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2
