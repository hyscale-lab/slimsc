Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They've provided the components of the operator P in the X, Y, and Z directions, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector and choose the correct option from the given choices.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should recall that the operator P is a vector operator, and in quantum mechanics, when dealing with spin, the components of the spin operator (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are involved. But here, the operator is P, which might represent spin or some other vector quantity, but the approach should be similar.

Wait, the problem says it's a muon. Muons are fundamental particles similar to electrons but with different mass. However, for the purpose of this problem, I think the specifics of the muon don't matter; it's about the operator and the eigenvector.

The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix. Let me write down each component's matrix.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's a Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. That's the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each corresponding to these 2x2 structures. So each component of P is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix.

Now, the operator P is a vector operator, so the total operator would be in the direction of the unit vector n, which lies in the x-z plane. So n is in the x-z plane, which means its y
