Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction where a pi bond moves along a conjugated sigma bond system. I think the key here is to figure out each reaction step by step.

The problem has three parts: reactions leading to products A, B, and C, and there are four options to choose from. Each option gives different structures for A, B, and C. I'll need to analyze each reaction separately and then match them to the options.

Let's start with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to give product A.

Hmm, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure must be something like (CH3O)2CHNH2. The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, let me write it correctly. The structure of but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, buten-ol. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol would have a double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (since it's 3-en), and the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, but that would be 3-en-2-ol: position 2 has the OH, and the double bond is between 2 and 3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond starting at carbon 3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

But-3-en-2-ol: but is four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? No, because butane is four carbons, so but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait, that's but-2-en-1-ol. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, another approach: the IUPAC name. But-3-en-2-ol: the longest chain with four carbons, double bond at position 3, and OH at position 2. So positions 1-4: 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4 (since it's at position 3), and the OH is on carbon 2. So the structure should be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, but that doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2
