Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms connected by a bond, and their motion includes both rotation and vibration. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for a particular vibrational level, right? Or wait, no, the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. But what's the next state in terms of energy? I think the energy levels in such models are quantized, and the transitions depend on both rotational and vibrational changes.

So the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That probably means the next higher energy state. But wait, in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. So the molecule could either change its vibrational state or its rotational state, or both. But the next state with the lowest possible energy would likely be the next vibrational state, because the vibrational energy quantum is much larger than the rotational one. Or wait, maybe not? Let me think.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy is E_J = (J (J + 1) ) ħc / (4I), where I is the moment of inertia. But the energy spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than between rotational levels because ω is a high frequency (given as 4e14 rad/s), but the rotational energy depends on the moment of inertia, which for a diatomic is (μ r²), where μ is the reduced mass.

So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's going to the next higher energy state. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states could be either v=1, J=0 (vibrational excitation) or v=0, J=1 (rotational excitation). But which requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Wait the question
