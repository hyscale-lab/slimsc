Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Oh right, so it's not a rigid rotor; the non-rigid one probably allows for some change in bond length. But wait, in the quantum models for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

So, the fundamental state would be the lowest energy state. For a diatomic molecule, the ground state is typically the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the molecule's symmetry). But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. For a non-rigid rotor, the bond length can change, but maybe for this problem, we can treat it as a rigid rotor since the given bond length is fixed.

The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state, so probably v=0 and J=0. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest state. But what's the next state? Well, the next higher energy state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1, maybe). But the
