Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll think it through.

Wait, the pp-III branch is one of the proton-proton reactions in the Sun's core. Right, the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun produces energy. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches are different pathways in this chain. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch is less significant compared to the main pp-I, which produces helium-4 from two protons and then more steps.

So, the question says that the pp-III suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to the surface. So, that means the change in the neutrino flux would take that time to reach Earth. But the question isn't about the timing, it's about the flux ratio now.

Neutrino flux from the Sun is primarily from the pp-chain reactions, especially the dominant pp-I branch. Neutrinos are produced via the beta plus decay steps in these reactions. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos as well, but I think it's a smaller source. So if pp-III stops, the total neutrino flux from that part would drop.

The question asks about the ratio of flux in two energy bands
