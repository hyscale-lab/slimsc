Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain part of the solar reactions stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think through this.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if something happens in the Sun's core, we'd detect the neutrinos almost immediately. But in this case, the pp-III branch stopped. I remember that the pp chain is one of the main ways the Sun produces energy, particularly in the core. The pp chain has several branches, and pp-III must be one of them.

I think the pp chain is responsible for producing helium-4 from hydrogen. Oh wait, and in the process, it emits neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop as well. But how does that affect the flux on Earth?

The question is about the ratio of flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, we're looking at flux1 over flux2.

Wait, but what neutrinos are we talking about? Solar neutrinos are mainly from the pp chain and the CNO cycle. Oh right, the pp chain produces neutrinos with lower energies compared to the CNO cycle. I think the main neutrinos from the pp chain are the electron neutrinos emitted in the beta decay steps.

So the pp-III branch is one of the steps in the proton-proton chain. Let me try to recall: The pp chain starts with two protons (hydrogen nuclei) fusing into a deuterium. Then, another proton adds to become helium-3. The pp-I branch is when two helium-3 nuclei fuse into helium-4, releasing two protons. The pp-II and pp-III branches involve capturing a proton by helium-3 to form carbon-12 or boron-11, respectively. Hmm, but I might be mixing up the details.

Wait, another thought: the pp chain's main neutrino emission comes from the decay of boron-8, which is a key step. Boron-8 has a half-life of about 7 seconds,
