Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem states that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, the decay probability P is 32% for 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, wait. No, wait—the next 150 minutes after the initial 100? Or after the 50 that have already passed?

Wait, the question says, "the next 150 minutes." So, I think that's the next 150 minutes from the current time. Since 50 minutes have already passed, the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, maybe I should model this using the concept of radioactive decay. Radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So the decay constant λ can be found using the given probability.

The decay probability (P) over time t is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the probability of decay is 1 - e
