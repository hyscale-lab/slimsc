Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Hmm, let's see. I remember that each step involves some reactions, so I should probably go through each step one by one.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I think cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. Trans means the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. So the structure must be something like a benzene ring attached to a CH2-CH2 group, but wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH2-CHO? Wait, no, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. Oh right! The structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH=CH-CHO? Wait, no. I think cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO. No, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is actually the aldehyde of cinnamic acid. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, cinnamic acid is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-COOH. No, no, wait, no. I think I'm mixing things up. Okay, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, so the structure is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. Oh wait, no. Let
