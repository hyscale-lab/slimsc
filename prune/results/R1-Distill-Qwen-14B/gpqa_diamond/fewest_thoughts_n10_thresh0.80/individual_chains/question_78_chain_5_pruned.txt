Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields, right? The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain point and time.

Let me read the problem again. So, there's a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. We need expressions for V and A at time t, where t is after tr.

Wait, I think the potentials are determined by the charges and currents. The scalar potential usually comes from the electric field, and the vector potential from the magnetic field.

I remember the Lorenz gauge condition, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Oh wait, the Lorenz gauge is a choice that simplifies Maxwell's equations, but the potentials here might be more directly calculated from the sources.

The scalar potential V is given by the electric field E. From electrostatics, I know that V for a point charge is q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But wait, when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because you also have magnetic effects.

The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. For a moving charge, the magnetic field is like that of a current. Oh right, the Biot-Savart law. But in terms of potentials, the vector potential is usually A = (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v × r̂ )/(r²) or something like that, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but in the context of retarded potentials, because the fields are determined by the motion of the charge at an earlier time. So the potentials depend on the state of the charge at time tr, and the observation is at a later time t.

Wait, the problem defines d as the vector from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So d would be r minus the position of the charge at time tr. Let me denote the position of the charge at time tr as s(tr). So
