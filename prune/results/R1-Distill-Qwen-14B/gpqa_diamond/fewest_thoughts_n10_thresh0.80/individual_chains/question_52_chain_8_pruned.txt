Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and think through what I remember from my studies.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti (titanium) in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, the ratio without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The formula I recall is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where:
- n is the number of atoms in each level,
- g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level,
- E is the energy of the level,
- k is the Boltzmann constant,
- T is the temperature.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). So the ratio n1/n2 would be higher when the temperature is lower because the exponential term becomes smaller. But wait, no, the ratio n2/n1 would decrease because the exponent is negative. Let me think.

Wait, the ratio they're considering is (n1/n2), right? The question says the ratio decreases when there are spots. Since the spots cause the effective temperature to drop, the ratio (n1/n2) should decrease, so (n1/n2)_without_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = factor > 1.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: When the star has spots, the Teff is lower. The Boltzmann distribution says that lower energy levels are more populated when the temperature is lower because the atoms have less thermal energy to jump to higher levels.

So, for a transition between two levels, let's say level 1 is lower in energy than level 2 (since the transition is from level 2 to 1 when emitting a photon at 1448 Å). So E2 > E1.

The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). As T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. So n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, the ratio (n1/n2) increases when T decreases.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I got the energy levels mixed up. Let me double-check.

In the Boltzmann equation, higher energy levels (E2) have lower populations at lower temperatures. So if the star's Teff drops, the ratio n2/n1 decreases. Thus, the ratio n1/n2 increases. But the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, which would decrease when T decreases. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, so n2/n1 is lower, which makes the ratio decrease. So the ratio (n2/n1)_with_spots is lower than (n2/n1)_without_spots.

Wait, but the question says the ratio of n1/n2 (which is the inverse) decreases. So let me make sure.

If the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, that would mean when T decreases, (n1/n2
