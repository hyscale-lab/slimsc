Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about stars with and without dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I need to find out the factor by which this ratio changes.

Alright, let's break down the problem. So, there's a star with certain parameters. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does the Teff change when spots are present? Oh right, dark spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, so they emit less radiation. So when spots cover part of the surface, the total luminosity changes, affecting the effective temperature.

But the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). So the ratio depends on the statistical weights and the temperature.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases to 5500 K. But wait, does that mean the photosphere's temperature is now 5500 K? Or is it that the average Teff is lower because parts are cooler? Hmm, the question states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler. So the star's surface isn't uniform anymore. So when spots are present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature (the spots), and the rest remains at 6000 K. But the question is about the photosphere as a whole. So perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature is a weighted average? Or maybe the spots affect the overall emission.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying things by considering the effective temperature as the average, so the entire photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, the question says when the surface is not covered, Teff is 6000. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500. So the star's luminosity must be lower because a large fraction of its surface is cooler. But the problem is in the context of the photosphere—so perhaps the average temperature is 5500 K. So the photosphere's temperature when spots are present is 5500 K. So the effective temperature is 5500 K in that case.

So the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels when the photosphere is at 6000 K vs 5500 K.

Wait, but wait a second. The transitions in Ti are at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or maybe the far UV. So that's a specific transition, which would be influenced by the local temperature.

In LTE, each region emits based on its own temperature. So when spots are present, parts of the photosphere are cooler (spots) and others are at 6000 K (non-spots). But when we observe the line, it's a blend of emission from different regions. But the problem is probably considering the average or perhaps the effective temperature.

Wait, no. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels in the stellar photosphere. So, in the photosphere, which when spots are present, is at 5500 K. Or wait, no—the spots are cooler, so the photosphere includes both the spotted and non-spotted regions.

Wait a minute, no. The effective temperature is a measure of the total radiation, but the photosphere's temperature varies across the surface. So regions with spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot, and the rest are at T0 = 6000 K. So when 40% of the surface is covered, perhaps the rest is at 6000 K, and the spots are at some lower temperature.

But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered, the Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is now considered to be at 5500 K. That might be a simplification, but I'll go with that because the problem says so.

So the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in
