Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the decay of a particle depends on the conservation laws and the energy available. So, for a boson X to decay into two particles, say a fermion f and its antiparticle f̄, the mass of X must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum have to be conserved, right?

Wait, but wait. In this case, the boson X is interacting with fermions. The Lagrangian here looks like it's a Yukawa interaction. The term ψ̄ X ψ would imply that the fermions couple to X. So the decay X → f f̄ would be possible if the energy is sufficient.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to figure out which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by two is 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass less than 3 GeV can be produced in a decay.

What are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think:

Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ-): about 0.105 GeV
Tau (τ-): about 1.777 GeV
Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (so about 0.0022 GeV)
Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (Wait, that's around
