Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f_bar(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think the structure here is similar to Yukawa interactions, where a boson couples to fermions. The term λ would be the coupling constant.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decay modes of X at the lowest order. So, I need to find which fermion pairs X can decay into based on conservation laws and energy considerations.

Wait, kinematical constraints mean that the energy of the decay products must be at least their rest mass. So for each possible fermion pair, say f and f_bar, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Let me list the fermions and their masses. The known elementary particles' masses are roughly:

- u quark: about 2.2 MeV
- d quark: around 4.7 MeV
- s quark: around 95 MeV
- c quark: about 1.3 GeV
- b quark: around 4.7 GeV
- t quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- e- (electron): ~0.5 MeV
- mu: ~105.7 MeV
- tau: ~1.78 GeV
- charged leptons are e, mu, tau, and their antiparticles.

So, X is 6 GeV. Let's see for each possible fermion pair:

1. b quark: mass around 4.7 GeV. So each b quark is 4.7 GeV. So for b b-bar, the total mass is 2 * 4.7 = 9.4 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV. 9.4 > 6, so that's not possible. So X cannot decay into b b-bar. So any options that include b quarks are probably wrong.

Wait wait, wait a second. Wait, wait. Hold on. Because in reality, when a particle decays into two particles, each of them must have energy at least their rest mass. So for a decay like X → f f_bar, each f must have energy >= m_f. The total energy is X's mass, so m_X = 2 E_f (if the particles are non-relativistic, which might not be the case, but for the threshold condition, it's when they're at rest, so E_f = m_f). So 2 m_f <= m_X.

So for each fermion f, if 2 m_f <= 6 GeV, then the decay is allowed. So let's compute 2m_f for each possible fermion.

Let's list the fermions:

- u: 2*2.2 MeV = 4.4 MeV → 0.0044 GeV. << 6 GeV → allowed
- d: 2*4.7 MeV = ~9.4 MeV → allowed
- s: 2*95 MeV = 190 MeV → 0.19 GeV → allowed
- c: 2*1.3 GeV = 2.6 GeV → allowed
- b: 2*4.7 GeV = 9.4 GeV → which is larger than 6 GeV → not allowed
- t: way too heavy, but X is 6 GeV, so t is 173 GeV each. Impossible.
- e: 2*0.5 MeV = 1 MeV → allowed
- mu: 2*105.7 MeV → ~211.4 MeV → 0.2114 GeV → allowed
- tau: 2*1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV → allowed

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are: u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. But not b or t.

So the decay products would be any pair of these fermions. So the possible decay channels include:

- u u-bar
- d d-bar
- s s-bar
- c c-bar
- e+ e-
- mu+ mu-
- tau+ tau-

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau, e+ e-.

Wait, but b's are not allowed because 2*4.7
