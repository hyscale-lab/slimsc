Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The Doppler shift tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, and the planets have similar masses. But the RV shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K of the velocity is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 AU) ) ) * (some unit conversion factor)

But wait, M_p is much smaller than M_*, so we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Also, since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_* is the same for both. And both planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both planets.

So if K (the velocity semi-amplitude) is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*) )^(1/3) ) / P^(1/3) ? Wait, let me think about the exact formula. 

Wait, the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/1) * (1/(2π)) ) ? No, perhaps I should look up the correct formula.

Alternatively, the formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, but since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But wait, sin i is approximately 1 because we're assuming circular orbits and edge-on alignment, which is typical for detection.

But since both stars are the same and both planets have the same mass, M_p and M_* are same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because other terms are same.

Wait, wait, let me get that right. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, because if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3) and K2 = C / P2^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, in the question, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5=1.4.

Wait, K2 is larger than K1. So what does that imply about P2?

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a larger K implies a smaller P. So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is shorter, that factor would be less than 1. Let me think.

Wait, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3.

Wait, no, because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → rearranged, P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K → P ∝ (1/K)^3 = 1/K^3.

So, P2 = (K1 / K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, let's see:

Because P ∝ 1/K³, so P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)³.

Because K2 is larger than K1, so K1/K2 is less than 1, so (K1/K2)^3 would be a number less than 1. Therefore, P2 is smaller than P1, so the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3.

Let me compute that:

5/7 ≈ 0.7143.

Cube that: (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.7143 * 0.7143 = ~0.51, then *0.7143 → ~0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1; the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is shorter, so the factor is less than 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if planet #2's period is 0.36 times planet #1's period, then it's shorter, not longer. So the factor is 0.36, meaning planet #2's period is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter by 36% of planet #1's period. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long, meaning P2 is shorter. But the question is about how many times longer is P2, so the answer is approximately 0.36 times, meaning P2 is shorter. So the ratio is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Because sometimes the formulas might have different dependencies.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) * (P * 86400)^(-1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 AU) ) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to recall that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

I think the correct formula is K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Therefore, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So P ∝ 1 / K^3.

Therefore, for planet 1 and 2:

P1 ∝ 1/K1^3

P2 ∝ 1/K2^3

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because P2 = (1/K2^3) * constant, and P1 = (1/K1^3)* same constant.

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1, which is option A (~0.36).

So the answer should be option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This implies that \( P \propto 1/K^3 \).

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) (for planet #1),
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) (for planet #2),

the ratio of the orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143 \), and cubing this value:

\[
\left(0.7143\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times that of planet #1. This means planet #2's orbital period is shorter than planet #1's by a factor of \( 0.36 \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
