Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm. So, I remember that the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Here, g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower (5500 K). If the ratio is (n1/n2), and this decreases, that suggests that n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. So what affects this ratio? The exponential term depends on temperature.

Let me think. The ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Let's assume that the energy difference is E2 - E1 = h c / λ. Because the transition is 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or visible range. So E = h c / λ.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, it's the energy difference that matters. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So the exponent becomes -ΔE/(k T) = - (hc)/(λ k T).

Now, when the temperature decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), what happens to the exponential term? Let's compute the exponent for both cases.

Let me compute the value for T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K.

First, let's write the ratio when there are no spots, R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And when there are spots, R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The factor we're looking for is R1/R2.

So R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ]

The
