Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main part of the question involves the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet range. Let me think, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the UV. So this is a UV transition.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower. So when the spots are present, the star's average temperature is 5500 K. But wait, dark spots on a star are cooler regions. So in reality, 40% of the surface is covered by cooler spots, and the rest is the original 6000 K. But the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. I'm not sure if I need to calculate the actual temperature of the spots here, but maybe it's not necessary for this particular question.

The key point is that the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels changes when the effective temperature of the photosphere changes. Because the photosphere is in LTE, the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation would be the effective temperature of the photosphere. Wait, but the spots are cooler, but when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps for the purpose of this ratio, we're considering the average temperature of the entire photosphere, which is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K otherwise. Or is each part of the photosphere at a different temperature? But since the problem says the photospheric effective temperature decreases, perhaps the model is that the overall temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So we can treat it as T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. When spots are present, the star's surface isn't all at the same temperature
