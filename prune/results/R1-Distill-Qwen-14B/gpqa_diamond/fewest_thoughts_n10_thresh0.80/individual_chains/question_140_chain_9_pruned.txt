Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by trying to break down the question.

The question says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm, let's take this piece by piece.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X isn't its usual element with the lightest isotope. Maybe it's something like Cl-35 instead of Cl-37, but wait, heavier isotope would be the opposite. Wait, no, heavier isotopes have more neutrons. For example, chlorine has two main isotopes: Cl-35 (~75%) and Cl-37 (~25%). If X uses a heavier isotope, maybe it's Cl-37.

When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecular formula of W must be something where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Wait, but protons are in the nucleus, and neutrons as well. So the molecule's formula must have a certain ratio.

Wait, but wait. For gas W, the molecule is neutral. Let me think about possible gases. Could it be H2O, NH3, CH4, CO2, etc.? Let's see:

H2O: H (1 proton, 0 neutrons each) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So each molecule has (2 H atoms: 2 protons, 0 neutrons) and O: 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So total protons in molecule: 2+8=10; neutrons: 0+8=8. Not equal.

What about NH3? N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons (if it's N-14). H has 1 each. So each NH3 molecule has 7+3 = 10 protons; neutrons: 7. So 10 vs 7. Not equal.

What about CO2? C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (C-12). O has 8 each. So each CO2 has 6 + 16 = 22 protons; neutrons: 6 + 16 = 22. Oh, that's equal. So W could be CO2.

Wait, but wait, the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. Oh wait, wait a second. I think I misunderstood the question. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. So for each molecule, the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.

So let's calculate for CO2: each molecule has 1 C atom and 2 O atoms. C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has
