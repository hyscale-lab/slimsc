Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. They produce a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms.

First, I think I should identify each of these substances. Let me start by looking for clues.

The gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, if protons = neutrons, the molecule is probably something like H2O (but wait, H has 1 proton, O 8. H2O has 2H and 1O: 2+8=10 protons, 10 neutrons? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for each molecule, the total protons equals total neutrons. So possible options could be CO2, but no, because CO2 is C (6 protons) and two O (8 each), so 6 + 2*8=22 protons. Neutrons would be (6 neutrons for C) + (8 each for O, so 16 in O2) => 6+16=22. So CO2: 22 protons, 22 neutrons. That fits. Alternatively, maybe something like CH4? No, CH4 has 6 (C) + 4*(1) =10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0 (assuming protium). So 6 +0=6. 10 vs 6. Doesn't match. Another possibility: NH3? Protons: N (7) + 3 H (1 each) =>10. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (since 14-7=7), H has 0. So 7. 10≠7. No. Wait, maybe another molecule. Could it be NO? NO has 14 (N) + 15 (O) → wait, no, NO has 7 (N) +8 (O) =15 protons. Neutrons: N has 7, O has 8. 7+8=15. So NO has 15+15=30? Wait, wait. Each NO molecule has 15 protons (7+8=15), and 15 neutrons (7+8=15). So yes, NO is a possibility. So W could be CO2 or NO.

Wait, but the reaction is violent, so maybe something explosive. But I'm not sure. Let's hold that thought.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, that's just above freezing. Looking for a solid with a melting point near that. Hmm. Water (H2O) melts at 273 K (0°C). So B is likely H2O. So when G is heated, it releases water. That suggests G is perhaps something that decomposes upon heating to
