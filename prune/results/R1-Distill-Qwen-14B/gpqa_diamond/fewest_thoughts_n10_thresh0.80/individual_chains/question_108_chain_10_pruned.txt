Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

The question says that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They mention small m values, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Paramagnetic coupling... oh right, that's the Zeeman effect, right? The Zeeman effect is when an atom's energy levels split in a magnetic field. But wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is part of that. So I need to find the expectation value of the magnetic Hamiltonian and compare it to the transition energy, which is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom.

The transition energy is given with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series, right? Specifically, the Balmer-alpha line, which is the transition from n=2 to n=1. Or wait, no, Balmer is n=2 to n=1? No, actually Balmer-alpha is n=3 to n=2, but maybe I'm mixing that up. Anyway, the key point is that the transition energy, ΔE, is the energy corresponding to that wavelength. 

First, let me calculate ΔE. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength. I remember the values: h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. 

So plugging in the numbers: E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6). Let's compute that. 

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Dividing by 0.4861e-6 gives roughly 4.088e-20 J per photon. But wait, I need to convert that into electron volts because atomic energy scales are usually in eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So dividing 4.088e-20 J by 1.602e-19 J/eV gives approximately 0.255 eV. So ΔE is about 0.255 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor (approx 2 for electrons), μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but since the question refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number m, perhaps it's considering the orbital contribution. Wait, m refers to the orbital quantum number. Oh wait, orbital magnetic quantum number is l, but the term m is m_l, which can take values from -l to +l. But wait, no, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which is m_l. So I think the paramagnetic coupling is due to the orbital contribution. Or wait, no, electrons have spin as well. But the question says m is the orbital, so maybe we're considering the orbital Zeeman effect.

Wait, the paramagnetic term is usually due to the spin, but here it says 'paramagnetic coupling term', which might include both orbital and spin contributions. But since they mentioned m (orbital), perhaps it's mainly the orbital part. But I might be mixing things up.

The orbital magnetic moment is given by μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1))^0.5 * m_l, but wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), so the orbital contribution would be μ_l = μ_B * m_l /
