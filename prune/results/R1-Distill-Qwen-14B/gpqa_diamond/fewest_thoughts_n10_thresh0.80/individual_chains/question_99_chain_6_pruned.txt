Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to pick the correct one based on the spectral data provided.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The peak at 3000 cm^-1 is very broad. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since it's very broad, it might be a carboxylic acid because they typically show a broad and strong O-H stretch due to hydrogen bonding. Also, there's a strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1. That area is usually indicative of carbonyl groups (C=O). For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is typically around 1700-1725 cm^-1. So that fits.

So the compound is likely a carboxylic acid because both the O-H and C=O peaks are present.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds or triple bonds in the structure, or if there are, they don't have adjacent hydrogens. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any structures with double bonds. The options are all branched alkanes with a carboxylic acid group. So that's good; no need to worry about vinyl Hs.

In the 1H NMR, two specific splitting patterns are mentioned: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me break that down.

Splitting in NMR occurs due to coupling with neighboring protons. Each splitting indicates how many neighboring Hs are present. A quartet means each proton is split into 4, so three neighboring Hs. Similarly, a triplet is two neighboring Hs, and a doublet is one.

Let's take the first splitting: doublet of triplets of quartets. Wait, no, actually, the description is a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That means each level of splitting adds another set. So maybe it's a complex multiplet where each proton is coupled with several different sets of neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a splitting pattern where each proton is coupled to more than one set of neighboring Hs, leading to a more complex splitting. For example, if a hydrogen is next to two different groups, each with a different number of Hs, the splitting would be a combination of their effects.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by looking at the structures of the options and see which one would give such splitting patterns.

The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Breaking that down, the structure is something like this: the central carbon is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a COOH group. So maybe it's CH2COOH at the end. The central part is a C with two branches: one is CH3 and the other is C2H5. Wait, no. Let me write the structure correctly.

Wait, option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the structure is: the chain is CH3-C(R1)(R2)-C(R3)(R4)-CH2-COOH, where R1 and R3 are CH3, and R2 and R4 are C2H5? Wait, no, looking at the formula:

Wait, the formula for A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the molecule has two CH(CH2CH3) groups attached to a central chain.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, more accurately: the central part is C(H)(C2H5), meaning each of those carbons is attached to a CH2CH3 group and a CH2 group from the chain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw each structure mentally.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

So structure is CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So, the backbone is -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but wait: the formula for D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, that's CH2CH2? No, I think it's CH3CH2-... So, the main chain would be four carbons: the first is CH3CH2-, then a CH with CH3, another CH with CH3, then COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about each option's structure.

Now, the NMR data says that one of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Let's think about what that implies.

A quartet suggests coupling with 3 neighboring Hs. A triplet would come from coupling with 2 Hs, and a doublet from coupling with 1 H.

So, a quartet of triplet of doublet would imply that a proton is coupled to three different sets of Hs, each with n=3, n=2, n=1? Or perhaps it's a combination. Wait, the way it's written is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, the splitting occurs in the order: first, quartets (so 3 neighbors), then triplets (2 neighbors), then doublets (1 neighbor). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about splitting in NMR.

When a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring Hs, each with a different number of Hs, their splittings combine. For example, if a proton is next to J1 (n=2) and J2 (n=3), the splitting would be a triplet of quartets, which would result in 2×3=6 peaks in total, but in reality, they coalesce into a multiplet.

Alternatively, a doublet of triplets of quartets would be a more complex splitting, perhaps from three different coupling partners, each with 1, 2, and 3 Hs respectively. Wait, no—each coupling is based on the number of neighboring Hs. So, if a proton is next to another set with 3 Hs, then another set with 2 Hs, and another with 1 H, the splitting would be a quartet (from 3 Hs), which splits each peak into a triplet (from 2 Hs), and each of those into a doublet (from 1 H). So the overall pattern would be a doublet of triplet of quartets. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where each proton is coupled with two different neighboring groups. For example, a CH group that's adjacent to another CH and a CH2. So, perhaps the structure has a central CH that is connected to two different groups, each with a different number of Hs.

Looking at the options, perhaps the structures have certain symmetry or branching that would lead to such splitting.

Let me think about each option's possible NMR signals.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The structure would have two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 (ethyl) group. So, the central part is like CH(CH2CH3) groups attached to each other. So maybe the structure is something like:

CH2CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me try to write the structure properly.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution. No, each CH is attached to an ethyl group and another CH.

Hmm, perhaps the central part is two CH groups connected by single bonds, each with an ethyl substituent.

In that case, the CH next to the ethyl groups would each have two neighboring ethyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2 (from CH3CH2-) connected to CH(CH2CH3), which is connected to another CH(CH2CH3), which is connected to COOH. So, the middle two CHs each have ethyl substituents.

In the NMR, the CH groups attached to ethyl would have how many neighboring Hs?

Each CH is attached to one ethyl group (which is -CH2CH3), and another CH. So, the CH would be connected to:

- One ethyl group (each CH2 in the ethyl is adjacent, but not directly next to the CH group)
Wait, no. The CH is connected to one ethyl group, which has two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, the CH group is attached to an ethyl (CH2CH3), which has two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each CH in option B.

Each CH is attached to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) and two CH groups. So, each CH has two neighboring Hs from the ethyl group (but perhaps not directly adjacent? Or maybe they are vicinal Hs. Wait, the ethyl group is attached to the CH, so the CH is connected to a CH2. That CH2 has two Hs adjacent to the ethyl's CH2 group. So, the CH in the structure would have neighboring Hs from the ethyl group's CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe a better approach is to think about the splitting in each option.

Looking for a CH group that has neighboring Hs from two different sources, leading to a complex splitting pattern.

Taking option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

The structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH3
