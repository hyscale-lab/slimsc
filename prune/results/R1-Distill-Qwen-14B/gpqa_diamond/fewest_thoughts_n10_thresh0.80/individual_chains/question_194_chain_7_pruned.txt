Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). So first, I need to figure out all possible states of the system and their corresponding energies.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Because some states might have the same energy.

Let me think about the energy expression. E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Let me denote each term. Each S_i is ±1, so the product S_i S_j is also ±1. So each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1.

So the sum inside the brackets is the sum of three terms, each ±1. So the sum can range from -3 (all terms -1) to +3 (all terms +1).

So let me compute the energy for each possible sum:

If the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is m, then E = -J * m. So m can be 3, 1, -1, -3, etc., but let me see all possibilities.

Wait, wait. Let me think about how m can vary.

Each term in the sum is S_i S_j. For three spins, each pair (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) is considered.

Let me think about the possible values of m.

Each S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So the sum m can be:

Case 1: All three terms are +1. So m=3.

Case 2: Two terms are +1, one is -1. So m=1.

Case 3: One term is +1, two are -1. So m=-1.

Case 4: All three terms are -1. So m=-3.

Wait, but maybe some of these are not possible. Let me think. For example, can m be 2?

Hmm,
