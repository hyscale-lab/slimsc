Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question asks for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with some tiny distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. Oh right, the formula I think involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The mean decay distance should be the product of the lifetime (proper time), the velocity, and the speed of light.

But wait, how do I get the lifetime? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should be careful with the units here.

Let me jot down the steps. First, calculate τ using Γ. Then find the speed v of the meson. Then compute the decay distance as L = v * τ * c, or perhaps L = βγ c τ. Wait, because the lifetime measured in the lab frame isn't the same as the proper time. Oh wait, no, because the decay length is in the lab frame where the meson is moving. So the meson's lifetime as observed in the lab
