Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. And there are four options to choose from.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or lifetime) is related to the particle's lifetime, which depends on its width. The formula I think is something like the mean proper lifetime τ is equal to ħ divided by Γ. But wait, units can be tricky here. Γ is given in MeV, so I need to make sure I convert that properly.

Oh right, ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because Γ is in MeV, I need to convert that to GeV. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 equals approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the division: 6.5
