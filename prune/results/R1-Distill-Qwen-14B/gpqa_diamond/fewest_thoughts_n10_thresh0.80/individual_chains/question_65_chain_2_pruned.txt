Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B based on the given conditions. Then, I'll match those products to the options provided.

Starting with reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+ to give product A. 

Hmm, I remember that spiro compounds can undergo various ring-opening or ring-forming reactions. Let me think about the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro means it's connected at one atom, so there are two rings connected by a single atom. The structure is something like a five-membered ring and a seven-membered ring (since 3.5 implies two rings with 3 and 5 carbons each, but including the spiro atom, maybe it's 4 and 6? Wait, the spiro notation is [n.m], where n and m are the number of carbons in each ring, excluding the spiro atom. So, spiro[3.5]non would be a 9-carbon molecule, because the two rings have 3+1 and 5+1? Not exactly sure, but maybe that's not critical right now.

The starting material has a vinyl group (double bond) and an alcohol group. When treated with a strong base like KOtBu (tert-butoxide) in THF, which is a common solvent for such reactions, I think elimination reactions or ring expansions might happen. But wait, the reagent is KH, which is potassium hydride. I'm not too familiar with that, but maybe it's a strong base as well. Alternatively, perhaps it's for deprotonation.

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of a base, the alcohol could lose a proton to form an alkoxide. Then, where's the site for elimination? The molecule has a double bond already, so maybe a neighboring group participation or some kind of cyclization. Oh wait, the molecule is a spiro compound, so perhaps it's going to undergo a ring-opening or some sort of rearrangement.

Wait, I think I remember that spiro alcohols can undergo acid or base-catalyzed ring-opening. But in this case, the conditions are THF and KH. Let me think about possible mechanisms. KH is a strong base, so maybe it deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs, but where? The structure is 1-vinyl, so the alcohol is on the same carbon as the vinyl group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of electrocyclic reaction? Or perhaps a ring expansion via an enol ether formation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The product in the options includes bicyclo structures. Bicyclo suggests that two rings are formed. The first option for A is (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one. Let me count the carbons: bicyclo[5.3.1] has (5+3+1 + 2) wait, no, the formula is (n.m.p) so 5,3,1. For bicyclo systems, the total carbons are n + m + p + 2. So 5+3+1+2=11. So it's an 11-carbon molecule with two rings.

So if the starting material is spiro[3.5]non, which would be nine carbons, how does it become undec (11 carbons)? Oh wait, perhaps the reaction adds some groups. Alternatively, maybe the starting material has more carbons than I thought. Wait, the starting molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The "non" part refers to nine carbons, so spiro rings of 3 and 5 carbons. The vinyl group adds two carbons (but it's a substituent, so maybe not adding to the count). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring expansion. The starting material is a spiro compound, and upon reaction, it forms a bicyclic compound. How? Perhaps through an elimination followed by a ring closure.

Alternatively, I remember that when a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, it can undergo ring-opening via E2 elimination, but then if there's a possibility for a new ring to form, perhaps a bicyclic structure could result.

Wait, another approach: the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The spiro is at position 1, and the vinyl is at position 1 as well. So the structure is perhaps:

O
|
OH
|
C=CH2 connected to the spiro atom.

Wait, maybe the alcohol is at the spiro position, so when deprotonated, the alkoxide could form. Then, perhaps the base induces an elimination, leading to the formation of a ketone via an enol intermediate and subsequent tautomerism or ring closure.

Alternatively, thinking about the reaction conditions, THF is a good solvent for such reactions. KH is a strong base, so maybe it abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination, forming a double bond, and possibly a ring expansion.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the second reaction to see if that gives me any clues.

Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is treated with
