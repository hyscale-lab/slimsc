Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in such transitions, certain selection rules apply. Oh wait, right! For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which means n=3, l=0, m=0. We need to find two transitions that take it down to |1,0,0⟩. Let's break this down step by step.

First transition from n=3 to some intermediate state, then another transition to n=1. Since l changes by ±1 each time, starting from l=0 (s orbital), the first transition must go to l=1 (p orbital). So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with l=1 and the same or adjacent m value. Since m starts at 0, the possible m values after transition are -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Wait, but what about the principal quantum number n? Since the atom is hydrogen, I think the selection rule for n is that it can change by any integer, but in practice, it's usually adjacent or nearby. So from n=3 to n=2 or n=1. But wait, the first transition can't go all the way to n=1 because that would require two steps. So the first step must go from n=3 to n=2, and then the second step from n=2 to n=1.

So first, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩, and then |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but how about the m changes in each step? Let's think. In the first transition, m can change by 0, ±
