Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about two compounds, A and B, reacting with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water to produce different diketones. I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are often involved in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic compounds, but wait, the products here are diketones. Maybe it's related to some kind of nitrous acid reaction? Oh wait, I think this involves the formation of carbocations or maybe the Gattermannâ€“Koch reaction, but not sure.

Wait, another thought. Diazonium salts are formed from aromatic amines, but in this case, the products are diketones. Oh, wait! I remember something about the treatment of alcohols with nitrous acid leading to ketones. Oh right, the von Braun degradation. When a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid (like HCl, NaNO2, and water), it undergoes a reaction where the alcohol is converted into a ketone. Oh wait, but wait, what about primary alcohols? They might form aldehydes, but under certain conditions, maybe they can dehydrate further.

Wait, so if A and B are secondary alcohols, then treating them would give ketones. But the products are diketones, meaning each product has two ketone groups. So each starting material must have two hydroxyl groups that are converted into ket
