Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the steps.

First, I remember that the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, any transition would be to a higher state, but the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that means the first excited state, which could involve either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, in the non-rigid rotor model, the molecule's rotational energy levels are quantized. But for a diatomic, the vibrational and rotational energies are often treated separately. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model).

Wait, wait. For diatomic molecules, the rotational states start at J=0. But wait, the rigid rotor model has J as an integer. So the fundamental rotational state is J=0, and the next is J=1. But I'm not sure how that interacts with the vibrational state.

Wait, the problem says it's in the fundamental state. Does 'fundamental' refer to both vibrational and rotational being in their lowest states? Or just one of them? Hmm, I think the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, which is v=0, and the lowest rotational state, J=0. So the initial state is v=0, J=0.

The molecule absorbs a photon, which would cause a transition to the next possible state. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next vibrational state, v=1. Because vibrational transitions can involve higher energy jumps, but maybe rotation is involved too. Alternatively, maybe the rotational state can change first.

Wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational. So when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition that changes either the vibrational state, the rotational state, or both.

But the question is about the next state
