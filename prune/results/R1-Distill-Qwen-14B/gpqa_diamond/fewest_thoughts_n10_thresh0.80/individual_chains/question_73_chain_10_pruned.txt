Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because relativity isn't my strongest subject. But let's see what I can do. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, I guess the first thing I need to do is figure out the relative speed between them. Wait, wait. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. I remember that you can't just subtract 0.5c from 0.6c because that would give 0.1c, but that's not correct in relativity. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula.

So the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, does that make sense? Because when you're moving at a high speed, the relative velocity isn't just the difference. So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

Wait, wait. Wait, the direction matters here. If both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed should be v1 - v2. So if they're in the same direction, the relative speed of the second from the first's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait. Let me write it down step by step. So v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Plugging in the numbers:

v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6*0.5 c²)/c²) = (0.1c) / (1
