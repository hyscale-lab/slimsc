Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation here. Hmm, I remember it's related to semiconductor devices and their current behavior under certain conditions. Let me try to think through this.

The question asks which statement is true about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation given is J equals (9/8) times epsilon mu V squared over L cubed. I think epsilon is the dielectric constant, mu is mobility, V is voltage, and L is the length of the device.

Wait, what's the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime again? Oh right, in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge—so the accumulation of charge in the device's vicinity affects the electric field, which in turn affects the current. This is typically in the regime where the voltage is high enough that the space charge can't be neglected. So the Mott-Gurney equation comes into play here.

Now, the options are A to D. Each talks about different conditions. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate things, maybe leading to more complex current behavior. Single-carrier probably means it's either electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact implies that the contacts are such that there's no significant barrier for carriers. But wait, if drift current is negligible, that doesn't sound right. Because in SCLC, drift is a big part of the current. Or am I mixing it up? Oh wait, Mott-Gurney is when the space charge is dominant, so maybe the equation assumes that drift currents are what's limiting the current. So if the option says negligible drift current, that might invalidate the equation because the equation models the scenario where drift is significant. Hmm, so A might be incorrect.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier makes sense because if there's a barrier, that could affect how carriers are injected, perhaps leading to more complications. Oh wait, no carrier injection barrier—does that mean it's an Ohmic contact? Because Ohmic contacts don't have a barrier. So single-carrier, trap-free, no injection barrier. And negligible diffusion current. Hmm. The Mott-Gurney equation, I think, comes into play when diffusion is not the main factor. Because in the SCLC regime, the current is governed by the space charge and the drift of carriers. So if diffusion is negligible, that fits. So B could be a candidate. But wait, the equation is about the situation where the current is limited by space charge, so perhaps the device should have no injection barriers, allowing for easy carrier movement. So this might be correct.

Option C: Single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts have a barrier, so carrier injection would be affected. Wait, but the equation assumes that the carriers are moving under the influence of the electric field. If there's a Schottky contact, the barrier might change how the carriers are injected, but I'm not sure. Also, the equation is generally considered for devices without such barriers because Schottky barriers can complicate the analysis. Plus, the equation's derivation assumes that the space charge distribution is determined by the drift of carriers, so if there's a significant barrier, perhaps the model doesn't apply. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current. Wait, Mott-Gurney equation is for single-carrier, right? Because if you have both electrons and holes, the derivation would be more complicated. I think the equation is applicable to single-carrier devices. So D is probably incorrect because it mentions two carriers.

Wait, but I'm a little fuzzy on that. Does Mott-Gurney apply to single or multi-carrier? I think the original Mott-Gurney equation is for single-carrier. For two-carrier systems, like in a p-n junction or something, there are different models. So D is probably wrong.

So, going back, the correct scenario for Mott-Gurney is a single-carrier device, trap-free, with negligible diffusion. Because the equation assumes the current is dominated by the space charge and drift, not diffusion. So which option matches that?

Option B says trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier (which implies Ohmic contacts?), and negligible diffusion current. So that seems to fit. So the equation is valid in that case.

Wait, but does the Mott-Gurney equation require an Ohmic contact or not? Because an Ohmic contact would allow for easier movement of carriers. The equation itself doesn't directly depend on the contact type, as far as I remember. It's more about the region where the space charge is dominant. So maybe the contact type doesn't affect the validity as long as the other conditions are met.

In the equation, the mobility is included, which relates to drift current. So if the drift current is not negligible, but the equation models the case where it's the dominant factor, then the equation holds. So if the statement says that drift current is negligible (like in option A), then that would make the equation invalid because the assumption is that the current is due to drift and space charge.

Wait, the question options say which statement is true. So in the equation, the J is proportional to V squared. That comes from the space charge build-up leading to a lower electric field. So the derivation comes from solving Poisson's equation under the assumption that the current is due to drift, and space charge is significant.

So, the conditions for the equation's validity would be: single-carrier, negligible traps (so no recombination centers), and that the current is dominated by drift (so drift is not negligible but diffusion is). Or wait, the equation is derived under the assumption that the space charge is so high that the electric field is modified, which affects the current. So perhaps the equation assumes that the current is entirely due to drift and that diffusion is negligible. Because if diffusion is significant, it would complicate the space charge distribution.

So looking at the options again. Option B says negligible diffusion current. So that fits. Option A says negligible drift, which would be the opposite of what's needed. So I think B is correct.

Wait, option B also says "no carrier injection barrier" which probably implies Ohmic contacts. That makes sense because in Ohmic contacts, the carriers can move without a barrier, which is necessary for the derivation. So Mott-Gurney applies to a trap-free single-carrier device with no injection barriers and negligible diffusion. So the answer is B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where \( \epsilon \) is the dielectric constant, \( \mu \) is the charge carrier mobility, and \( L \) is the length of the device. The validity of this equation depends on specific conditions, which are analyzed in the following options:

- **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that drift current is significant and governs the space-charge-limited current. If drift current were negligible, the equation would not apply. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes negligible diffusion current, as the current is dominated by drift and space-charge effects. Additionally, the absence of a carrier injection barrier (e.g., Ohmic contacts) ensures that carriers can move freely, which aligns with the assumptions of the equation. This option is consistent with the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation holds.

- **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts introduce a barrier, which complicates the analysis and may alter the space-charge distribution. This makes the equation less applicable in such cases. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived for single-carrier devices, as the presence of two carriers (e.g., electrons and holes) introduces additional complexities. Thus, this option is also incorrect.

The correct conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation are described in **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the assumptions of the equation: a trap-free single-carrier device, no carrier injection barrier, and negligible diffusion current.

**Answer: B**
