Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see... the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to the Sun. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

First, the problem gives me the masses of the stars, but I think mass might not be directly relevant here because the question is about elemental abundances. So I'll focus on the abundance ratios given.

Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. Because the [X/Y] notation is log base 10 of (X/Y ratio relative to the Sun). So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Star_1 has twice as much Si relative to Fe as the Sun does.

Wait, but Star_1 also has [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That's important. [Fe/H] is the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen. So 0 means Fe/H is 10^0 = 1, same as the Sun. So Star_1's iron abundance is the same as the Sun's. That means Star_1's overall metallicity ([Fe/H]) is solar, but the ratio of Si to Fe is higher.

Now for Star_2. It has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2, so higher Mg relative to Si compared to the Sun. Also, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg/H is 1, same as the Sun. So Star_2's Mg is at solar abundance, and since Mg/Si is higher, that implies that Si is lower in Star_2 compared to the Sun.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If Mg/Si is higher in Star_2, then Mg is more
