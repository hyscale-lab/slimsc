Okay, so I have this NMR problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which compound it is. The options are between cis and trans for propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm, let's think about what each of these structures looks like and how their NMR spectra would appear.

First, I remember that propenyl and butenyl are types of alkenes. Acetate esters have the structure R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. So, the structure is something like CH3CO-O-R, where R has a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data provided: 

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz): Okay, a doublet with a large coupling constant. That suggests a vinyl proton, maybe adjacent to another proton. The coupling of 16 Hz is pretty big, so it's probably between two equivalent protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond.

- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq): A doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe a doublet with some splitting. Wait, the notation is a bit tricky. Dq could mean doublet of quartets, but more likely, it's a doublet of some sort. Maybe this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton adjacent to another group.

- 2.1 ppm (3H, s): That's a singlet, likely the acetoxy group's methyl (OAc). So the ester is acetate.

- 1.6 ppm (3H, d): A doublet with 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to a carbon adjacent to a double bond. Wait, like in isopropyl groups or something. Oh, maybe a vinyl group with a neighboring CH2 or CH.

Wait, but butenyl would have four carbons in the chain, and propenyl has three. Let me think about the structures.

Cis-propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. But acetate ester would be OAc-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the substituents.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2? No, no. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. But in the acetate ester, it's OAc-O-CH2CH=CH2? Or maybe OAc-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, the propenyl group as the R in the ester would be something like CH2CH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, no. Let me get the structures right.

Propenyl acetate is CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as an alkenyl group. So the
