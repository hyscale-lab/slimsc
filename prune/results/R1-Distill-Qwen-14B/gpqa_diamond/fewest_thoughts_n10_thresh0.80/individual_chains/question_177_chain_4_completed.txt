Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, and they also measured their radial velocities as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So, luminosity of a star as a black body—I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R radius, T temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, I think the peak wavelength where a black body emits most strongly depends on the temperature. Oh right, Wien's law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2 because λ1_max = λ2_max.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would imply same temperature. So both stars have the same T. So T1 = T2.

But wait, what about the Doppler shift from their velocities? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. But does that affect the peak wavelength we measure?

Wait, this might complicate things. Let me think: if a star is moving towards us (radial velocity towards us is positive?), then the wavelengths we observe are blueshifted. If moving away, they're redshifted. But the question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max for both is the same. But that would have to account for their velocities.

Wait, let me get this straight. The peak emission of a star is at its rest frame λ_max, given by Wien's law. But if the star is moving towards us, we'd see that peak λ as blueshifted—so λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) ) ), or something like that? Or maybe it's just a simple Doppler shift where λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + radial velocity / c), but I might be getting the sign wrong.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is often approximated as Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, where v is the radial velocity. But when the source is moving towards you, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c), assuming v is positive when moving towards us. But wait, is that accurate for non-relativistic speeds? Because 700 km/s is a pretty high speed, but still much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s). So maybe we can approximate.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps their observed wavelengths of maximum emission are the same. That would mean that λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

So, the rest frame λ_max of each star would be different if they have different velocities. Because the observed λ_max is their rest λ_max multiplied by (1 + v/c), considering the Doppler effect. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign here. Let me think again.

If a star is moving away from us, its light is redshifted, so observed λ is longer. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, is that moving away or towards us? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Wait, radial velocity is typically positive when moving away, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the sign can vary based on convention, but in the problem, perhaps it's just the magnitude that's given. Hmm.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_1's radial velocity is 0 (not moving towards or away from us), and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Let's assume that positive radial velocity means moving away from us. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

So, the observed λ_max for each star would be:

λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 * (1 + v1/c)
λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c)

But wait, wait—if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So when v is positive (moving away), λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), right? So for Star_1, v1 is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, v2 is 700 km/s away, so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + 700e3 / c ). Since c is about 3e5 km/s, 700e3 / c is 700/(3e5) ≈ 0.002333, so 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

But according to the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1.002333)

Because λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, and λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 1.002333. Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * 1.002333.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1.002333)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333

Which implies T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So the temperatures are slightly different. So T1 is lower than T2.

Wait, but wait—no, because if the observed λ_max is the same, and Star_2 is moving away (so its λ_rest is smaller, because λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * 1.002333, same as λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of rest frame λ. Let me write the equations again.

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + v1/c) → since v1=0, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c) → v2 is 700 km/s away, so v2 = +700 km/s.

So,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1,

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5) = λ_rest2 * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 * λ_rest2.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = 1.002333 * λ_rest2.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T → λ_rest1 = b / T1,

λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.002333 → T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.99768.

So T1 is slightly less than T2.

Wait, that's a problem because I thought their temperatures would be same, but now it's clear that because of the Doppler shift, they have different temperatures. So I can't ignore the velocities when considering their temperatures.

But wait, let's make sure. The problem says that the stars' brightest wavelengths are the same when observed. So the observed λ_max is the same, but their rest frame λ_max would be different because of their velocities.

So, each star's rest frame λ_max is different, but when observed, they look the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both. So the temperature of each star can be found via their observed λ_max.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by equating their observed λ_max and then find the relation between their temperatures.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the initial approach. The problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the question is: what is L1 / L2?

As per Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4π R² σ T^4. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 ).

We know that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5 → R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1/T2)^4.

So the question is, what is the value of (T1/T2)^4?

But to find T1 and T2, I need to account for the Doppler shift because the observed λ_max is same for both.

From earlier analysis, we have:

λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 → since Star_1 has v=0.

λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c) → because Star_2 is moving away.

And λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

So,

λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ_rest is inversely proportional to T. So,

λ_rest1 = (b / T1),

λ_rest2 = (b / T2).

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

→ 1/T1 = (T2 + (v2/c T2 )) / T2².

Wait, perhaps easier to express as:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

But v2 is 700e3 m/s (since 700 km/s). Let me compute 700e3 / 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 /3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

So (1 + v2/c) = 1 + 0.0233333 ≈ 1.0233333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.0233333 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So T1 is approximately 0.977 times T2.

Wait, but wait: wait, when a star is moving away, the observed λ is longer. So the observed λ_max is same, so λ_rest,1 = λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c). Therefore, λ_rest,1 is longer than λ_rest,2, which implies that T1 is lower than T2 because λ is inversely proportional to T.

So, T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c)^-1.

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + 0.023333) = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So, T1 ≈ 0.977 T2.

So, the ratio T1 / T2 is approximately 0.977.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

Hmm. 0.977 is about 0.977.

Computing 0.977^2: 0.977 * 0.977 → Let's calculate:

0.977 * 0.977:

= (1 - 0.023)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.023 + 0.023² ≈ 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 ≈ 0.954529.

Then, (0.977)^4 = (0.954529)^2 ≈ ?

0.9545^2: Let's compute:

Approx 0.9545 * 0.9545.

Let me compute 9545 * 9545:

Wait, 95^2 is 9025.

But for 0.9545: 0.9545 * 0.9545.

Let me approximate:

(0.95 + 0.0045)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2 * 0.95 * 0.0045 + (0.0045)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107025.

Wait, but that's for 0.9545. Wait, 0.9545 is 0.95 + 0.0045. So, when I square that, I get 0.95² + 2*(0.95)(0.0045) + (0.0045)^2 = 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107.

So, (0.9545)^2 ≈ 0.91107.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.91107.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, no, L is proportional to R² T^4, so the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) ) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

So, R1=1.5 R2 → (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(T1 / T2)^4 ≈ 0.91107.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ 2.0503.

Wait, but that's about 2.05. But none of the options are close to 2. Hmm. The options are 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (T1/T2) more precisely.

Wait, let's compute T1/T2 correctly.

v2 is 700 km/s. So (v2/c) = 700e3 / 3e5 = 700,000 / 300,000 = 7/3 ≈ 2.33333e-1 ≈ 0.23333 ?

Wait, wait, 700e3 m/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.0233333... So about 0.02333333.

So, (1 + v2/c) = 1.02333333.

So, (1 + v2/c) is approximately 1.0233333.

So, T1 = T2 * (1/(1.0233333)) = T2 * 0.977077.

So, (T1/T2) = 0.977077.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977077)^4.

Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 0.977077^2:

0.977077 * 0.977077.

Let me compute 977077 * 977077 — but perhaps an approximate way.

0.977077 squared:

= (1 - 0.022923)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.022923) + (0.022923)^2 = 1 - 0.045846 + 0.0005255 ≈ 0.9546795.

Then, (0.977077)^4 = (0.9546795)^2.

Compute 0.9546795 * 0.9546795.

Again, using the same approach: 0.9546795 = 0.95 + 0.0046795.

So (0.95 + 0.0046795)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)*(0.0046795) + (0.0046795)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.0046795 = 2 * 0.95 * ~0.00468 ≈ 2 * 0.004446 ≈ 0.008892.

(0.0046795)^2 ≈ (0.00468)^2 ≈ 0.0000219.

Adding them together: 0.9025 + 0.008892 = 0.911392 + 0.0000219 ≈ 0.9114139.

So, (0.977077)^4 ≈ 0.911414.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911414 ≈ 2.25 * 0.911414.

Let me compute that: 2 * 0.911414 = 1.822828, 0.25 * 0.911414 ≈ 0.2278535. So total ≈ 1.822828 + 0.2278535 ≈ 2.05068.

So approximately 2.05, which is about 2.05 times.

But none of the options are close to 2.05. The options are ~2.23, ~2.25, ~2.32, ~2.35.

So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler shift consideration.

Alternative approach: perhaps the observed maximum wavelengths being the same means that their rest frame wavelengths are the same, so T1 = T2.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation of the luminosity ratio. Because the observed maximum wavelength being same could mean that the stars have same temperature, but that's only possible if their velocities are considered.

Wait, if the observed λ_max is same, but their actual temperatures could be different if their velocities are different.

Wait, but another approach: if the observed λ_max is same, then the product of their rest frame λ_max and their Doppler factors must be same.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more accurately.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest via the Doppler effect formula.

For small velocities (v << c), the Doppler shift can be approximated as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

where v_r is the radial velocity (positive when moving away).

So for Star_1, v_r1 = 0 → λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, v_r2 = +700 km/s → λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 )

= λ_rest2 * (1 + 0.023333) ≈ 1.023333 * λ_rest2.

Given that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_rest1 = 1.023333 * λ_rest2.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T → λ_rest1 = b / T1, λ_rest2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = 1.023333 * (b / T2 )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = 1.023333 / T2 → T1 = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.977 * T2.

So, T1 is 0.977 T2.

Now, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4π R² σ T^4 → L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 ) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5 → (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T1/T2 = 0.977 → (0.977)^4.

Calculating (0.977)^4:

Compute 0.977^2 first: 0.977 * 0.977.

Let me compute it more accurately.

0.977 × 0.977:

= (0.9 × 0.9) + (0.9 × 0.077) × 2 + (0.077 × 0.077)

= 0.81 + (0.0693) × 2 + 0.005929

= 0.81 + 0.1386 + 0.005929 = 0.954529.

Then, (0.977)^4 = (0.954529)^2.

Compute 0.954529 × 0.954529:

Again, let's compute it accurately.

0.954529 × 0.954529.

= (0.9 + 0.054529)^2

= 0.81 + 2*(0.9)*(0.054529) + (0.054529)^2

= 0.81 + 0.0981522 + 0.0029736

= 0.81 + 0.0981522 = 0.9081522 + 0.0029736 ≈ 0.9111258.

So (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.9111258.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111258 ≈ 2.0500.

Which is approximately 2.05.

But none of the options are near that. The options are all about 2.23 and up. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second. Did I mix up the Doppler shift formula? Because sometimes, the Doppler shift is given as λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for transverse Doppler effect, but perhaps for radial velocity, it's just λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) when moving away. But wait, maybe I should use the exact relativistic Doppler shift formula. Because when velocities are significant (like 700 km/s is a non-negligible fraction of c), the approximation might not be accurate enough.

Ah, right, 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light, which is small, but perhaps the exact formula would give a slightly different result.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the exact formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But wait, that's for the transverse case. Alternatively, the correct formula for the case where the source is moving directly away (radial velocity) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) )

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

The Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away with velocity v along the line of sight is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, I think it's λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (1 + v/c) ) / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll try to remember.

The relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving away (v >0) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, that's for the case where the motion is perpendicular (transverse Doppler effect), leading to time dilation. For the case of motion directly towards or away, the formula is different.

Ah, right! For radial Doppler shift (motion directly towards or away), the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (1 + v/c) ) / (1 - v²/c² )^{1/2} )

Wait, no, wait. The exact Doppler shift formula for a source moving away with velocity v is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, I think that's the transverse case. For radial motion, the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

But wait, let's think in terms of frequency. The Doppler formula for frequency is:

f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ) when moving away.

Because when the source moves away, the observed frequency decreases.

Since λ = c / f, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me approach it differently.

In any case, for small velocities (v << c), the Doppler shift can be approximated as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c ) for receding sources (v positive when moving away).

So for Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 ) = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 0.0023333) ≈ 1.002333 * λ_rest,2.

But the observed λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2 → λ_rest,1 = 1.002333 * λ_rest,2.

But if I use the exact formula, perhaps the result would be slightly different.

Let me try using the exact formula for the Doppler shift.

The exact formula for the observed wavelength when the source is moving away at velocity v is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, that's for the transverse case. For the case where the source is moving directly away, the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

But wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the Doppler effect for wavelength when moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

No, that's not correct. Let me think about the relativistic Doppler formula for wavelength when moving away.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) 

Wait, no, that's when the source is moving towards you. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the correct formula.

The correct relativistic formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving away with velocity v is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps I should proceed with the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio of λ_obs for both stars and set them equal.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

If Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, and Star_1 is stationary, and both have the same observed λ_max, then the rest frame λ_max of Star_2 must be shorter than that of Star_1.

So λ_rest,1 = λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c).

So,

λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v2/c).

Since λ_rest = b/T,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + 700e3 / 3e5 ) = T2 / (1 + 0.023333) ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So, T1 ≈ 0.977 T2.

Then, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (0.977)^4 ≈ 2.25 * (0.911) ≈ 2.05.

Hmm, same result as before. But the options don't have 2.05. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem states that the masses are the same as the radii ratio of 1.5. Star_1 is 1.5 times larger in radius and mass than Star_2. But how does mass relate to luminosity? Oh wait, perhaps it's a red herring. The problem says to assume that the stars radiate as black bodies, so their luminosities depend only on R and T.

So, perhaps the mass information is a distractor. It doesn't affect the calculation.

Wait, but maybe the mass affects the radius and temperature via other factors, but the problem gives R and T, so perhaps mass isn't directly relevant here.

Hmm, but in reality, more massive stars are hotter, but in this problem, we're given that the R is 1.5 times, and the same mass factor, so perhaps it's meant to confuse, but the calculation is based on R and T.

So, perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.05, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Alternative approach: perhaps the observed λ_max is not the same in their rest frames. Oh wait, no, the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max is same for both.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift is to be considered in the opposite way. For example, maybe I should account for the fact that Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ_max is longer, but since both observed λ_max are same, the rest λ_max of Star_2 must be shorter than Star_1.

Wait, no, that's what I did earlier. So, I'm not sure where the error is.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the actual temperatures using the Doppler shift, because the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual temperatures are different. So, perhaps the ratio (T1/T2) is (something else).

Wait, let's write the equations again.

λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 × (1 + v1/c )

λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 × (1 + v2/c )

But for Star_1, v1 is 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.

For Star_2, v2 is +700 km/s, so λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 × (1 + 0.023333).

Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2,

λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 × 1.023333.

But λ_rest = b / T → λ_rest,1 / λ_rest,2 = T2 / T1 = 1.023333.

So,

T2 = 1.023333 × T1.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.977 × T2.

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 × (0.977)^4 ≈ 2.25 × 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

But the options are all higher than 2.05. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact Doppler formula for wavelength. Let's try that.

The exact Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest × sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, no, that's the formula for frequency, not wavelength. Let me think correctly.

Wait, the relativistic Doppler effect formula relates the observed frequency to the source frequency. The formula is:

f_obs = f_rest × sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )

Since f = c / λ,

f_obs = c / λ_obs,

f_rest = c / λ_rest.

So,

c/λ_obs = (c/λ_rest) × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Cancel c,

1/λ_obs = (1/λ_rest) × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

→ λ_obs = λ_rest × sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Ah, so that's the correct formula for λ_obs when the source is moving away at velocity v.

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest × sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, for Star_2:

λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 × sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But we know that λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

Star_1 has v=0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.

So,

λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 × sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

λ_rest,1 / λ_rest,2 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T → λ_rest,1 / λ_rest,2 = T2 / T1.

So,

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

→ T2 = T1 × sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Let me compute (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) with v=700e3 m/s.

v = 700,000 m/s,

c = 3e8 m/s → v/c = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

So,

(1 + 0.0233333) / (1 - 0.0233333) = (1.0233333) / (0.9766667) ≈ 1.04785.

So sqrt(1.04785) ≈ 1.0236.

So,

T2 = T1 × 1.0236 → T1 = T2 / 1.0236 ≈ 0.9766 T2.

So, T1 ≈ 0.9766 T2.

Now, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 × (T1/T2)^4.

R1 = 1.5 R2 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

(T1/T2) = 0.9766 → (0.9766)^4.

Compute 0.9766^2 = ?

0.9766 * 0.9766:

= (1 - 0.0234)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0234 + (0.0234)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0468 + 0.00054756 ≈ 0.95374756.

Then, (0.9766)^4 = (0.95374756)^2.

Compute 0.95374756 * 0.95374756:

= (0.95 + 0.00374756)^2.

= 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.00374756 + (0.00374756)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.0070705 + 0.00001404 ≈ 0.9025 + 0.0070705 ≈ 0.9095705 + 0.00001404 ≈ 0.90958454.

So, (0.9766)^4 ≈ 0.90958.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.90958 ≈ 2.044.

Still around 2.04, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) with v=700e3 m/s.

v/c = 0.02333333.

So,

(1 + 0.02333333) = 1.02333333,

(1 - 0.02333333) = 0.97666667.

Their ratio is 1.02333333 / 0.97666667.

Compute that:

1.02333333 / 0.97666667.

1.02333333 ÷ 0.97666667 ≈ let's compute it as:

1.02333333 / 0.97666667 = approximately 1.04785.

The square root of 1.04785 is sqrt(1.04785).

Compute sqrt(1.04785):

We know that 1.023^2 = 1.046529, since 1.023 * 1.023 = 1.046529.

1.0235^2 = ?

1.0235 * 1.0235:

= (1 + 0.0235)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0235 + 0.0235^2 = 1 + 0.047 + 0.00055225 = 1.04755225.

Which is very close to 1.04785.

So, sqrt(1.04785) ≈ 1.0235 + a bit more.

Let me compute 1.0235^2 = 1.04755225.

We have 1.04785 - 1.04755225 = 0.00029775.

So, the next approximation is to find x such that (1.0235 + x)^2 = 1.04785.

Expanding:

(1.0235)^2 + 2*1.0235 * x + x² = 1.04785.

We know (1.0235)^2 = 1.04755225.

So,

1.04755225 + 2*1.0235 * x + x² = 1.04785.

Subtract 1.04755225 from both sides:

2*1.0235 *x + x² = 0.00029775.

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible.

So,

2*1.0235 *x ≈ 0.00029775 → x ≈ 0.00029775 / (2.047) ≈ 0.0001453.

So, sqrt(1.04785) ≈ 1.0235 + 0.0001453 ≈ 1.023645.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.023645 → T1 = T2 / 1.023645 ≈ 0.9766 T2.

Then, (T1/T2) = 0.9766.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.9766)^4.

Compute 0.9766^2.

0.9766 × 0.9766:

= (0.97 + 0.0066)^2 = 0.97^2 + 2*0.97*0.0066 + 0.0066^2.

0.97^2 = 0.9409.

2 * 0.97 * 0.0066 = 0.012804.

0.0066^2 = 0.00004356.

Adding up: 0.9409 + 0.012804 = 0.953704 + 0.00004356 ≈ 0.95374756.

Now, (0.95374756)^2 = ?

Compute 0.95374756 × 0.95374756.

= (0.95 + 0.00374756)^2 = 0.95^2 + 2*0.95*0.00374756 + (0.00374756)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 * 0.95 * 0.00374756 ≈ 2 * 0.95 * 0.00374756 ≈ 0.0070705.

(0.00374756)^2 ≈ 0.00001404.

Adding: 0.9025 + 0.0070705 = 0.9095705 + 0.00001404 ≈ 0.90958454.

So, (0.9766)^4 ≈ 0.90958454.

Now,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.90958454) = 2.25 * 0.90958454 ≈ 2.044.

So that's approximately 2.044.

But the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So none of them are 2.04.

Hmm. I'm clearly missing something, but I can't see the error in my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the mass information is supposed to be used in some way. But how?

Wait, the problem says that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2.

But how does mass relate to luminosity? Well, in real life, more massive stars are more luminous, but that's mostly because they are larger and hotter. But in this problem, we're given R and T, so perhaps mass isn't directly relevant. But maybe the problem expects me to use the mass-luminosity relation, but that seems unlikely because it says to assume black body radiation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem states that the stars have the same observed λ_max, so their effective temperatures are the same. But that would only be possible if their velocities are zero. But that's not the case here.

Wait, but if their observed λ_max is the same, but considering their velocities, their actual temperatures must be different. So, perhaps I should have calculated the reciprocal of the Doppler shift when computing the temperature ratio.

Wait, earlier I have:

λ_obs = λ_rest × sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which leads to,

λ_rest = λ_obs / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) → λ_rest = λ_obs × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, for Star_2, λ_rest,2 = λ_obs × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2 = λ_obs.

So,

λ_rest,1 = λ_obs,

λ_rest,2 = λ_obs × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Thus,

λ_rest,1 / λ_rest,2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which gives,

λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 × sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is what I had before.

So, T1 = T2 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, because λ_rest = b / T → T = b / λ_rest.

So,

T1 = b / λ_rest,1,

T2 = b / λ_rest,2.

So,

T1 = (b) / (λ_rest,1) = (b) / (λ_rest,2 × sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )) )

= T2 × (1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )) )

= T2 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So, if v is positive (moving away), then (1 - v/c) < (1 + v/c), so sqrt((1-v)/(1+v)) is less than 1, so T1 < T2.

Thus,

T1 = T2 × sqrt( (1 - 0.0233333)/(1 + 0.0233333) )

Compute (1 - 0.0233333) = 0.9766667,

(1 + 0.0233333) = 1.0233333.

So,

sqrt(0.9766667 / 1.0233333) = sqrt( (0.9766667) / 1.0233333 )

= sqrt( 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 ) ≈ sqrt(0.954545) ≈ 0.977.

So,

T1 = T2 × 0.977.

Which brings us back to the same place.

So, the ratio is indeed 2.05.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the relativistic Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the observed λ_max is the same, but we should calculate the ratio of the luminosities including the Doppler shift in terms of flux.

Wait, another approach: The flux received from a star is affected by both its luminosity and distance, but since the problem doesn't mention distance, perhaps it's irrelevant. But maybe the problem is considering the observed flux's peak wavelength.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. So, perhaps considering the Doppler shift, which affects the observed λ_max, but the actual T is adjusted accordingly.

But I'm going in circles here.

In any case, the calculation leads to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I should reevaluate the problem.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same temperature because their observed λ_max is same, ignoring the Doppler shift. So, perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement, and I should proceed under the assumption that T1 = T2.

So, if T1 = T2,

Then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Which is option A.

But that would be ignoring the Doppler effect, which seems incorrect. But perhaps the problem expects that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended for us to not consider the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the stars are moving with those velocities, but the observed λ_max is same, leading to same T. But that's not possible. Because if one star is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer, so to have same observed λ_max, the rest λ_max must be shorter.

Wait, no, that's what I did earlier. So I think the correct calculation leads to L1/L2 ≈ 2.05, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (0.977)^4.

Let me compute (0.977)^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.977 × 0.977: as before, 0.954529.

Then, 0.954529 × 0.954529.

Compute 0.954529 × 0.954529.

I'll use a calculator-like approach:

First, 0.95 × 0.95 = 0.9025.

But for 0.954529 × 0.954529:

Let me compute it as:

(0.95 + 0.004529) × (0.95 + 0.004529) 

= 0.95² + 2*(0.95)*(0.004529) + (0.004529)^2.

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.00429255) + 0.0000205.

= 0.9025 + 0.0085851 + 0.0000205 ≈ 0.9111056.

So, (0.977)^4 ≈ 0.9111.

So, 2.25 × 0.9111 ≈ 2.05.

Which is still not matching any options.

Wait, but perhaps the problem states that the velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, but perhaps Star_2 is moving towards us, which would make the observed λ_max shorter. Let me think.

If Star_2's velocity is towards us, then the Doppler shift would blueshift the observed wavelengths, making λ_obs,2 shorter than λ_rest,2.

So, for Star_2 moving towards us at 700 km/s,

λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But if λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2,

Then,

λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which would imply that λ_rest,1 < λ_rest,2 → T1 > T2.

So, perhaps I should recalculate with Star_2 moving towards us.

But the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

Wait, radial velocity can be positive or negative depending on direction. Let's assume that positive radial velocity is moving away, and negative is moving towards us.

So, Star_2's velocity is +700 km/s, moving away. So, the earlier approach holds.

But if Star_2 were moving towards us, then v would be -700 km/s, and the Doppler shift would be different.

But the problem states that Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, and Star_1 is 0. So perhaps Star_2 is moving away.

But regardless of that, my calculation leads to an L1/L2 ratio of approximately 2.05, which isn't among the options.

Hmm. Perhaps I should check my calculation of (0.977)^4.

Wait, 0.977^2 is 0.954529.

0.954529^2 is about 0.911.

So 2.25 * 0.911 is 2.05.

So, perhaps the mistake is that the luminosity is not only radius and temperature, but also other factors. Oh wait, no, the problem says to assume black body radiation, which is based solely on R and T.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question uses the inverse of the Doppler shift factor.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of using (1 + v/c), the problem uses (1 - v/c) in the Doppler shift formula.

But that would change the results.

Wait, for example, if I used the Doppler shift as λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 - v/c), then for Star_2 moving away, λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 - 0.0233333) → 0.9766667 * λ_rest,2.

If λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1, and λ_obs,2 = 0.9766667 * λ_rest,2, and they are equal,

λ_rest,1 = 0.9766667 * λ_rest,2.

Then, from Wien's law,

λ_rest,1 = b / T1,

λ_rest,2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = 0.9766667 * (b / T2 ) → T1 = T2 / 0.9766667 ≈ 1.024 T2.

Then,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (1.024)^4.

Compute (1.024)^4.

1.024^2 ≈ 1.048576.

Then, 1.048576^2 ≈ 1.10075.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.10075 ≈ 2.477.

Which is approximately 2.48, which is still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25.

Which is option A.

But why would the problem mention the velocities then? Maybe it's a red herring.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to say that the stars have the same effective temperature, so T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Which would be option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler shift, which would affect the observed λ_max, but perhaps the problem expects that.

Given the confusion, and the options provided, I think the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (T1/T2) more accurately.

Let me compute T1 = T2 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), where v=700e3 m/s.

v/c = 700e3 / 3e5 = 7e5 / 3e5 = 7/3 = 2.333... × 1e-1 → 0.233333 × 1e-1? Wait, no—7e5 divided by 3e5 is 7/3 ≈ 2.33333 × 1e-1 → 0.233333.

So,

(1 - v/c) = 1 - 0.0233333 = 0.9766667,

(1 + v/c) = 1.0233333.

So,

sqrt(0.9766667 / 1.0233333) = sqrt(0.95454545) ≈ 0.977.

So,

T1 = 0.977 T2.

Then,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4.

Compute (0.977)^4 accurately.

0.977^2 = 0.954529.

0.954529^2:

Compute 0.9545 * 0.9545.

= (0.95 + 0.0045) * (0.95 + 0.0045)

= 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)*(0.0045) + (0.0045)^2

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025

= 0.91107025.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = 0.91107025.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107025 ≈ 2.050.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is 2.23, which is option D.

But I'm not seeing where the error is in the calculation. Perhaps the problem expects that the Doppler shift is not considered, and the luminosity ratio is simply (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the effect of velocity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option D) ~2.23.

Because when considering the Doppler shift more accurately, the ratio might come out to 2.23.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (T1/T2) using the exact formula.

Let me compute T1 in terms of T2.

T1 = T2 × sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

v/c = 700e3 /3e5 = 0.0233333.

So,

(1 - 0.0233333) = 0.9766667,

(1 + 0.0233333) = 1.0233333.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 = approx 0.954545.

sqrt(0.954545) = 0.977.

So,

T1 = 0.977 T2.

Then,

(T1/T2) = 0.977 → (T1/T2)^4 = 0.977^4 ≈ 0.911.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.911 ≈ 2.05.

But option D is ~2.23, which is higher than 2.25 * 0.911.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the same luminosity, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reciprocal of the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the luminosity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the Doppler factor.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have both stars have the same observed flux, but that's a different matter.

I'm stuck. Given the options, and the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I'm not entirely confident.


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The key parameters provided are:

- **Radius**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
- **Mass**: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (though mass is not directly relevant for black body luminosity)
- **Observed peak wavelengths**: \( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)
- **Radial velocities**: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)

The luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

\[
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Thus, the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Relating \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) using Wien's Law and Doppler Shift
The observed peak wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) is related to the rest-frame wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \) via the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_1 (\( v_1 = 0 \)) and Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)), the observed wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)). This implies:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest},1} = \lambda_{\text{rest},2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto 1/T \)), the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

Substituting \( v_2/c = 700 \, \text{km/s} / 300,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.023333 \):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.023333}{1 + 0.023333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.976667}{1.023333}} \approx 0.977
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Luminosity Ratio
The radius ratio is given as \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \), so:

\[
\left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 = (0.977)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (0.977)^2 \):

\[
(0.977)^2 = 0.954529
\]

Then, square the result to find \( (0.977)^4 \):

\[
(0.977)^4 = (0.954529)^2 \approx 0.9111
\]

Now, substitute into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9111 \approx 2.05
\]

### Step 3: Analyzing the Options
