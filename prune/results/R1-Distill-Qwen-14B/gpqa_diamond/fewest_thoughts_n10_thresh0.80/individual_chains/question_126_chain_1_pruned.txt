Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem says that an organic chemist performs two reactions. Reaction I involves treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and then an acidic workup. The products from both reactions are combined and run on two HPLC columns: one normal-phase and the other chiral. The question is how many peaks the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

Hmm, so I need to figure out the products of each reaction and then determine their structures, especially focusing on whether they have stereocenters because that affects how they'll behave in the chiral HPLC.

Let's start with Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure of that would be a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. So, it's like CH3-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3 maybe? Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO in the middle of a six-carbon chain. So positions are 1, 2, 3 (keto), 4, 5, 6. Wait, no, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3? No, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO in the middle... Let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. No, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO in the middle. Wait, perhaps better to write the structure.

So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, no, the numbering is 1 to 6. So position 3 is the ketone. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C(O)-
Then, carbons 4,5,6: Let me see. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(O)-(CH2)2-CH3. So, carbon 3 is the ketone. Then, 5-methoxy means the methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Carbon chain: 1    2    3    4    5    6
              CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me draw it:

Positions:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O (since it's a ketone)

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH
