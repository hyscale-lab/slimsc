Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm. I remember that when benzene derivatives undergo such reactions, the substituents on the ring can direct the incoming electrophile to specific positionsâ€”either para, meta, or ortho. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's an ortho/para director or meta.

The question gives six different substituents attached to a benzene ring, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. That means I have to figure out for each substituent how much of the para product is formed when bromine (excess) reacts with them. The order should start from the one with the least para product to the one with the most.

Let me list out the substituents again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester, so the group is O-CO-OEt?)
Wait, no, wait. Structure 2 is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Or is it C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? No, wait, the formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. Oh wait, that's probably the ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid. So the group is -COOEt, which is an ester.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorine)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro group)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (that's like ethyl group, so -C2H5)
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid group, -COOH)

Wait, but wait a second. No, actually, I think I might have made a mistake. Let's re-express each structure correctly.

1) C6H5-CH3: Benzyl methyl group. So substituent is -CH3.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That would be benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (COO-) connected to ethyl (C2H5). So it's a benzoyl ester? Or is it the benzene ring with a COOEt group. So substituent is -COOEt.

3) C6H5-Cl: Benzene with Cl substituent.

4) C6H5-NO2: Benzene with nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Benzene with ethyl substituent, so -C2H5.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzene with a carboxylic acid group, -COOH.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Structure 5 is C6H5-C2H5, which is actually ethylbenzene, right? So substituent is -CH2CH3.

Okay, now I need to analyze each substituent's directing effects.

So first, I should list each substituent, determine if they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are ortho/para directors or meta directors.

1) -CH3 (methyl): It's an activating group because it's an electron-d
