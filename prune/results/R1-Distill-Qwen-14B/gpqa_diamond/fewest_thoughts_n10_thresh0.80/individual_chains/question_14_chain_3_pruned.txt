Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I need to figure out where the peaks would disappear when using a different fixation method. Hmm, let me think. I remember that ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. So in this case, they're using an antibody for IKAROS, which is a transcription factor important in B cells.

The question says that when they used PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation alone, they got some peaks, but when they switched to PFA plus DSG (which I think is a crosslinking agent, maybe dithiothreitol?), those peaks disappeared. Wait, why would that happen? I recall that PFA is a common fixative that crosslinks proteins to DNA, but sometimes it's not enough for certain conditions or regions.

Oh right, I think PFA might not efficiently crosslink proteins in certain areas, like where the chromatin is more open or in regions with high transcriptional activity. DSG probably helps with crosslinking in those regions. So without DSG, maybe some peaks aren't captured because the proteins aren't crosslinked properly.

The disappearing peaks in the PFA+DSG condition... so the original PFA alone didn't fix those regions. Which regions are harder to fix? Active promoters and enhancers are regions where transcription is happening, so the chromatin is more open. Maybe PFA alone doesn't crosslink there as effectively, but with DSG, it does. So when they used PFA without DSG, those regions didn't show up as peaks because the crosslinking wasn't strong enough. But when they added DSG, those regions were fixed properly, so the peaks would appear. Wait, but the question says the peaks disappeared when using PFA+DSG. Wait, no, the question says that the PFA alone gave peaks that disappeared with PFA+DSG. That can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. The setup is that the PFA-fixed sample produced certain peaks, but when they used PFA+DSG, those peaks were gone. So the peaks in PFA samples were in regions that are hard to fix, but when DSG was added, which enhances crosslinking,
