Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think I need to figure out the rest mass first.

Wait, Li is lithium. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because Li typically has 3 protons (since it's element 3), and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the atomic number is 3, mass number 6. So its molar mass would be approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). 

I remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy (mc²) of the nucleus would be 6 * 931.5 MeV, which is 5589 MeV, or 5.589 GeV. Okay, so m = 5.589 GeV/c².

The problem gives the speed as 0.96c. So I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. The formula for relativistic energy is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. 

Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's plug in v = 0.96c. So v² is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² would be 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, I think. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Hmm, but let me calculate it more accurately. Maybe using a calculator approach.

Wait, 0.28 squared is indeed 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

So now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by mc². So E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV. Let's compute that.

Let me calculate 5.589 * 3.5714.

Let me break it down: 5 * 3.5714 is 17.857, 0.589 * 3.5714 is approximately 2.100. So adding together, 17.857 + 2.100 = 19.957 GeV. Wait, that's about 19.957 GeV. Hmm, but let me do it more accurately.

Wait, actually, 3.5714 is approximately 3.57142857, which is 25/7, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 5.589 * 3.5714.

Let me multiply 5.589 by 3.5714:

First, 5 * 3.5714 = 17.857.

Then, 0.589 *3.5714. Let's compute that:

0.5 *3.5714 =1.7857
0.08 *3.5714=0.285712
0.009 *3.5714=0.0321426
Adding those: 1.7857 +0.285712=2.071412 +0.0321426≈2.10355.

So total is 17.857 +2.10355=19.96055 GeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, my calculation gives around 19.96 GeV, which isn't exactly one of the options. The closest option would be C) 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps the gamma is not exactly 3.5714. Let me re-calculate gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Wait, 0.0784 is 784/10000. sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the rest mass is not exactly 5.589 GeV? Let me check that.

Wait, the mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01512 u, right? Because each Li-6 atom has an atomic mass of about 6.01512 u. Oh wait, I think I might have used the wrong mass. Because the question says nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Wait, the rest mass energy is m*c², which is (6.01512 u) * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me compute that.

6.01512 * 931.5 = ?

Well, 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. But let's compute 6.01512 *931.5.

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.01512 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5=9.315

0.00512 *931.5 = approximately 4.76688

Adding them: 9.315 +4.76688=14.08188.

So total is 5589 +14.08188 = 5603.08188 MeV = 5.60308188 GeV.

Ah, so the rest mass is about 5.60308 GeV/c², not 5.589 GeV. My initial estimate was wrong because I used 6 u instead of the exact atomic mass.

So now, m*c² is 5.60308 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857..., so E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.60308 GeV.

Let me compute that.

5.60308 *3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps breaking it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.60308 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.14285714.

0.00308 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.011010.

So approximately 2.14285714 +0.011010 =2.15386714.

Add to 17.85714285:

17.85714285 +2.15386714 ≈20.01101 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.011 GeV. Now looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is closer but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma again to a higher precision.

v = 0.96c.

So beta = v/c =0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

Compute 0.96^2 =0.9216.
