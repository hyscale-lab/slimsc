Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6.

The question is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, and their kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. So I think I need to use the gamma factor here.

Gamma is given by the formula gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since the speed v is 0.96c, let's calculate gamma first. Plugging in the numbers: v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². So (v²/c²) is 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is, wait, 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Hmm, maybe I should keep more decimals for accuracy. Wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, right? The rest mass energy is m*c². But I need to find m, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². Wait, let me get the exact values. Proton mass is roughly 938 MeV, but more accurately, I think it's around 1.007276 GeV/c². Neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c².

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) GeV/c². Let me calculate that. 

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 GeV
3 * 1.008665 =
