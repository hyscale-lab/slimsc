Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But wait, wait, I think Clemmensen uses HCl with red phosphorus, but sometimes HI is used too. So maybe that's the reaction here.

Now, I need to determine what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Then, figure out what product is formed after the reaction.

Let's look at the IR data first. The peaks are given at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range. That region usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the 3400–2500 might also suggest an alkyne C-H stretch, but that's in a different range. Oh, wait, no, alkynes have higher wavenumbers, around 3300. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, but looking at the other peaks might help.

The other IR peaks are at 1720 cm-1 and 1610 cm-1. 1720 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group. That would fit with a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1610 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So putting this together, maybe X is a ketone with an aromatic ring and an alcohol group. Or perhaps a carboxylic acid? Wait, but the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid; those are usually around 1700. Hmm, maybe it's an ester, but then the 1720 is a bit high. Alternatively, a ketone would be around there.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several peaks:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, which suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a carboxylic acid's -OH proton is even higher, but in the NMR, the -OH in a carboxylic acid would be broad, maybe around 10-12 ppm. Wait, the 10.5 is a singlet, but in carboxylic acids, the -OH is usually a broad peak, possibly split, but maybe in this case, it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like an alcohol's -OH, but that's usually lower. Hmm, not sure yet.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets probably indicate two sets of equivalent protons, adjacent to substituents in the para positions. So if the ring is
