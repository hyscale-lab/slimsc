Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think red phosphorus and HI is a reagent I've heard about before. Oh right! When you use red phosphorus with HI, it's typically a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Wait, no, wait. Or is it something else? Or perhaps it's a reaction to eliminate a leaving group. Alternatively, I remember that red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, maybe in the formation of alcohols. Wait, no, that's for something else. Oh wait, I think when you have a tertiary alkyl halide, reaction with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of an alkyne. Because red phosphorus and HI can act as a strong base, leading to dehydrohalogenation twice, removing two HX molecules and forming a triple bond. So that's probably what's happening here.

So the starting material is Compound X, and after treatment with red phosphorus and HI, it forms a product. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out what X is, and then determine what reaction would form.

First, let's look at the spectroscopic data for Compound X.

The IR data is: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, 1450, 1450 cm-1. Wait, 1450 appears twice, maybe a typo, but okay.

The IR peaks: the broad range between 3400-2500 suggests an X-H stretch. That could be either an alcohol (O-H) or a carboxylic acid (O-H), or maybe an alkyne's C-H stretch. Wait, but alkyne C-H is usually around 3300 as a triple bond. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 2500-3300. But the 3400–2500 is a pretty broad range, so maybe it's an O-H from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group. For example, a ketone, aldehyde, or ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700. But if the carbonyl is at 1720, that might be more ester, ketone, or aldehyde. But since the IR also shows 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the range of aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data for Compound X.

1H NMR:
10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a broad singlet. Could be an O-H from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols usually have O
