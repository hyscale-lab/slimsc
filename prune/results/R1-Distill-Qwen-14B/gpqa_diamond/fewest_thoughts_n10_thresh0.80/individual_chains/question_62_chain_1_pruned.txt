Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, understanding the target molecule: It looks like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group, and then there's a carbaldehyde group (CHO) on the cyclohexane. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group, and also a CHO group attached.

Wait, maybe drawing it would help. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane. On carbon 1, there's a substituent: a CH group that's connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. And also, on the same carbon 1, there's an aldehyde group. Or wait, maybe the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) and the aldehyde is on the same carbon? Hmm, perhaps I should think about the nomenclature.

Alternatively, maybe it's cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1 which is a CH group. This CH is connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. Also, the same carbon has a formyl group (CHO). So, the structure is like cyclohexane where one carbon (say C1) has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a CHO group attached. Wait, but that would give four bonds on carbon 1, which isn't possible unless it's a quaternary center. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, so the structure is a cyclohexane with a CH2 group where one H is replaced by hydroxyl, and the other by cyclohexyl. And then, that same carbon (or another?) has a CHO group. Maybe I should think about the possible reactions that can get me from ethynylcyclohexane to this target.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, it's cyclohexane-Câ‰¡CH.

I need to go through the reagents in the options and see which sequence would produce the target.

Looking at the options, each has several steps. The target requires introducing a cyclohexyl group, an OH group, and a CHO group. Let's see.

Let me think about the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane to something else. Maybe functionalizing the triple bond.

Option A: First step is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is
