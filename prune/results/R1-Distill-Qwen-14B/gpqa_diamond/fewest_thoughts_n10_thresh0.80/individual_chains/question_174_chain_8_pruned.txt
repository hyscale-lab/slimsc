Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and energy. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Oh wait, the sum of their rest-masses is 99% of M. So the initial mass was M, but the fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99M. That means some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in fission, some mass turns into energy, like Einstein's E=mc².

So the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since they're moving, they'll have kinetic energy. The problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the value calculated classically.

Wait, wait. So I need to calculate T1 relativistically and then subtract the non-relativistic approximation. Or is it the other way? The question says, "the difference between the correct T1 and T1 calculated using classical approximation." So correct T1 minus classical T1, I guess.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the rest masses of the two fragments.
2. Use conservation of energy and momentum to find their velocities (or energies).
3. Calculate the kinetic energy using relativistic formulas.
4. Do the same using classical mechanics (non-relativistic) and find the difference.

First, the rest masses. Let me denote the two fragments as m1 and m2. Given that m1 is twice m2. Let's write m1 = 2m2.

The sum of their rest masses is 0.99M. So:

m1 + m2 = 0.99 M
But m1 = 2 m2, so:

2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M.

So m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M. Wait, wait, 0.33*3 is 0.99
