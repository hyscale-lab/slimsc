Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that should make the math easier.

The key data here are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, but wait. I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) )) )

But since the planets are Neptune-sized, their mass is much smaller than the star's (which is solar mass). So M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, which is the Sun's mass. So I can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) / sqrt(1 - e²). Since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So K ≈ (M_p) / ( M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * (some constants).

Wait, but wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, the denominator is approximately M_star^(2/3). So K ≈ (2π G / (c P))^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3).

But in this problem, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is same for both. Also, the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is same for both. And since the orbital periods are what we're comparing, let's think about the relation between the RV shifts and the period.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is K. So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, because from the formula above, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), assuming M_p, M_star, and sin i (which is 1 for edge-on orbits, but same for both planets) are constant.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3))) / (P^(1/3)) ), because from the formula:
