Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

The problem says that two stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both orbits are circular. So, the planets are probably in the same kind of orbit, but their RV signals are different.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. So, the ratio of P2/P1 is what we're after.

Wait, the RV method detects the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to the velocity. So, for small velocities, the formula is approximately Δλ ≈ (v * λ) / c, but I'm not sure if that matters here. Oh wait, here's the thing: the RV semi-amplitude K is the star's velocity, which is what causes the Doppler shift. So, if the shift is larger, that means K is larger.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? I remember that the RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination. But since both planets are detected, the inclinations are probably similar (like edge-on, which is the best case for maximum RV signal).

The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P * (2π)^(1/3))) ) )^(1/3) )? Hmm, maybe I should think about the simplified version when the planet is much less massive than the star, which is the case here (Neptune vs Sun-like star). So M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies.

Wait,
