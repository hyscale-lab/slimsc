Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Then, when X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. 

Hmm, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above 0 degrees. So what substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water. Wait, water freezes at 273 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius. So 277 K is a bit above, so maybe a different compound. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W, G, and B when heated. So perhaps G is a precipitate, which suggests a double displacement reaction or something similar. Maybe Y is an acid or a base.

Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So what gas has equal protons and neutrons? Let's see. For example, H2 gas: each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so two of them would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not equal. Wait, maybe another gas.

Wait, another option is carbon monoxide (CO), but that's not a gas that comes from such reactions typically. Or maybe O2, but O2 has 8 protons each, and each O atom has 8 neutrons (in the most common isotope). So O2 would have 16 neutrons and 16 protons. Oh wait, that's equal. So gas W is O2? Or maybe N2? Let's see, N has 7 protons. If it's N2, each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (since the common isotope is N-14). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That also fits. So gas W could be O2 or N2.

Wait, but the reaction is violent, so maybe it's a more reactive situation. Perhaps the reaction is between a metal and an acid. For example, if X is a metal reacting with an acid Y, producing hydrogen gas. But wait, earlier I thought W had equal protons and neutrons. Hydrogen gas is H2, which has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So that doesn't fit. So maybe W isn't H2.

Alternatively, maybe W is CO2. Let me think: CO2 has one C (6 protons and 6 neutrons) and two O (8 each). Wait, but each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so CO2 has 2 C's? No, wait, CO2 is one C and two O. So each O has 8 protons. So the molecule would have 1 C (6 protons) and 2 O (8 each *2=16 protons) → total 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8 → total 6 +
