Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C. That's just above freezing, so B is probably a solid under normal conditions. 

Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a substance similar to X. Oh, and X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's think about the reaction first. Violent reaction with liquid Y? Common reactions that are violent include things like metals reacting with acids. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Maybe Y is water? Or maybe something else.

But let's think about possible substances X. The question mentions it's a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like NaOH, KOH, Na metal, maybe something like Li or Na. Wait, but considering isotopes, perhaps X is something with a heavy isotope. Wait, in the problem statement, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So for example, maybe X is something like NaOH, where Na has a heavy isotope, or maybe it's something like NH3 with a heavy N isotope? Not sure yet.

Then, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. If W's molecule has the same number of n and p, that means for each molecule, the total neutrons equals protons. Let's see common gases:

- H2: H has 0 neutrons. So each molecule has 0 neutrons, 2 protons. So 0≠2. No.
- O2: O has 8 protons. Each O atom has 8 neutrons (since O is usually ^16, 8p, 8n). So O2 has 16p, 16n. 16=16. So W could be O2?
Or maybe another gas. Let's see:

CO2: Each molecule would have 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 12 +32=44. But each CO2 molecule has C (6p, 6n normally) and O (8p, 8n each). So for each CO2 molecule, total p is 6 + 2*8 =22, n is 6 + 2*8=22. So 22=22. So CO2 could be W. But wait, when substances react, what gases are released? For example, when metals react with strong acids, H2 is released. But if Y is a strong base, maybe CO2 is released when an acid is added.

Wait, but in the problem, X reacts with Y, which is a liquid. So maybe Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate? Then CO2 would be released. Alternatively, maybe Y is water, and X is a metal that reacts violently with water, releasing H2. Wait, but earlier I thought H2's n and p don't match, but maybe W is H2, but each molecule has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 p and 0 n. So total protons per molecule: 2, total neutrons: 0. So 2≠0. That doesn't fit. So CO2 might be a better fit.

Wait, another gas: NH3? No, because when you have a reaction, maybe releasing NH3... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CH4? No, because that's not typically a product of such reactions. Wait, maybe O2? Let's think about another approach.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. And B's melting point is near 277 K. So room temperature is about 298 K, so 277 is a bit chilly. So B is a solid at normal temperatures. Maybe B is something like water? No, because water's melting point is 273 K (0°C). Oh wait, 277 is 4°C. So B could be something that's a solid just above 0°C, like maybe a solid with a slightly higher melting point.

Wait, but if G is the precipitate, perhaps it's a carbonate or a hydroxide. For example, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction would release CO2 gas. Then, the precipitate might be a metal hydroxide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other clues.

The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids have a carbonyl group (C=O). Reacting with X
