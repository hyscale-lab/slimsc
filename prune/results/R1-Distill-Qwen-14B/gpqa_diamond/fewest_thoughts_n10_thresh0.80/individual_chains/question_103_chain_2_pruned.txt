Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. The options are four different reaction sequences, labeled A to D. Each option lists several reaction steps with reagents. I need to determine which sequence correctly leads to the desired product.

First, let me think about the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, the phenyl group has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromo group and a nitro group. Then, attached to this phenyl group is an ethanone group (which is a ketone, so a carbonyl group attached to two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one?), wait no. Wait, ethan-1-one would be CH3-CO- something. No, wait, ethan-1-one structure is (CH2)2CO? Or wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)COH? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO–, but I think the correct structure is a ketone where the carbonyl is at position 1. Wait, more accurately, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but that's actually acetone. Wait, no, acetone is propan-2-one. Hmm, maybe ethan-1-one is a ketone where the carbonyl is at the end, so O=C-CH2CH3. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5 (bromo and nitro), and attached to that benzene is a ketone group (the ethanone part). So the structure would be benzene with Br at position 3, NO2 at 5, and a ketone group (like a COCH2CH3?) wait, no, because ethan-1-one is (CH2)2CO, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's a benzoyl group connected to a CH2 group. Wait, no, the correct structure for 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one would be (Ph)C(O)CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH2)1-CO, so it's CH3-CO- attached to the benzene? No, wait, perhaps I should draw it mentally as the benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and at the 1 position (which is ortho to Br and meta to NO2?), there's a ketone group—so perhaps the benzene has a COCH2CH3 group attached. Wait, but ethan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH3. So the substituent is the ketone group at the para position relative to something? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is attached directly, but that wouldn't make sense because benzaldehyde is an aldehyde, but a ketone would need to be at a position where the carbonyl is between two carbons. So in this case, the benzene ring has the ketone group attached as a substituent, like Ar-CO-CH3, but I think I'm getting stuck on the structure—maybe I should move on and think about the synthesis steps.

The target molecule has substituents at positions 3 and 5 on the benzene ring. The substituents are bromo and nitro. Also, there's a ketone group attached. The order of adding these substituents and the ketone is important because the positions of the substituents depend on the directing effects of the groups.

In aromatic substitution reactions, nitro groups are strong meta directors, and bromine (as a substituent) is also a meta director when it's attached to the ring. The ketone group is an electron-withdrawing group and acts as a meta director as well.

Wait, but if the starting material is benzene, we need to add these groups in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

So let's think about the steps involved. The target has a nitro group, a bromo group, and a ketone group (maybe as an acetyl group? Like from an acetylation reaction).

The synthesis steps likely involve electrophilic substitution reactions. Common reagents for introducing nitro groups are HNO3 with H2SO4 (nitration), and for bromine, Br2 with FeBr3 (bromination). For ketone groups, perhaps an acetylation using something like CH3COCl in the presence of AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation).

But wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation is used to add an acyl group to an aromatic ring. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions require activating groups because they are electrophilic substitutions. Benzene itself isn't very reactive, so if the groups we add are deactivating, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the groups are added in a certain order to allow for the necessary activating effects.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating, which would make the ring less reactive. So adding a nitro group early on might make subsequent reactions difficult, especially Friedel-Crafts which requires an activated ring (like with activating groups such as -OCH3, -NH2, etc.).

So maybe the ketone (acetyl group) has to be added early, before any deactivating groups are introduced. Because once you have a nitro group, which is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts won't work anymore on that ring.

So the general approach would be to add activating groups first, then deactivating ones. But wait, the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring, so it's a deactivating group and thus cannot be added via Friedel-Crafts unless the ring is activated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the order of adding substituents based on their directing effects.

So, the target has a benzene ring with a nitro group (strongly deactivating, meta-directing), a bromine (moderately deactivating, meta-directing), and a ketone (deactivating, meta-directing). All three are meta directors. So each substituent directs incoming groups to the meta positions relative to themselves.

But wait, that's complicated because adding multiple substituents would require them to be in positions that don't interfere destructively with each other.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to introduce the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the acetyl group. Or perhaps in another order.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl group is added first. Let me try to outline possible steps.

Option 1: Introduce the nitro group first. Benzene undergoes nitration to yield nitrobenzene. But nitro is a meta director. Then, bromine could be introduced in a position meta to the nitro group. Then, perhaps the acetyl group is added. But wait, after nitration and bromination, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts acylation wouldn't work. So
