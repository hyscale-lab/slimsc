Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity equations. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are about their relative speed and the total energy. I need to find both.

First, the relative speed. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v relative to a stationary observer isn't simply u - v. Instead, there's this formula involving the velocities and the speed of light.

The formula for the relative velocity u' between two objects moving at u and v (both in the same direction) is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, let me get that right. Oh right, if object A is moving at u relative to observer, and object B is moving at v relative to the same observer, then the speed of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) — but wait, wait, no, depends on the direction. Oh, wait, in this case, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So from A's perspective, which is moving at 0.6c, what's the speed of B, which is moving at 0.5c in the same direction.

Wait, actually, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So here, u is the velocity of the second object (0.5c) relative to the first object (0.6c). Let me think: the relative speed should be (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the terms correct. Oh, wait, no. The formula for the velocity of object B as seen from object A (which is moving at u=0.6c relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at v=0.5c relative to lab frame) is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Because from A's frame, the lab is moving at -u, so B's velocity is (v - u)/(1 - uv/c²).

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me confirm the formula. The velocity of B in the frame of A is (v + u')/(1 + (u' v)/c²) ), where u' is the speed of A relative to the lab. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of velocity addition.

The correct formula for the relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case, u is 0.6c (A's speed), and v is 0.5c (B's speed). Wait, but wait, that would give (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) )= -0.142857 c. But relative speed is a magnitude, so it's 0.142857 c, approximately 0.14c. That would be one of the options.

Wait, but wait, this can't be right because 0.5c is slower than 0.6c. So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c (A), the other astronaut (B) is moving at a slower speed. So from A's frame, B would appear to be moving backward? No, because both are moving in the same direction as per the lab frame. Oh wait, but in the lab frame, A is faster than B. So in A's frame, would B be moving in the same direction or opposite? Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So from A's frame, B's velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) )= (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approx -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that in A's frame, B is moving in the opposite direction. But since we're talking about relative speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed would be 0.14c.

Wait, but another way to think: When you're moving at a high speed, objects moving in the same direction but slower appear to be moving backward relative to you. So yeah, that makes sense.

So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which would match one of the options.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of each is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (2m) moving at 0.6c: gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B (3m) moving at 0.5c: gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.4641 = approximately 5.9641 m c², which rounds to 5.96 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D says 5 mc².

Wait, let's recalculate the energies more accurately.

Gamma for A: 0.6c. (0.6)^2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Gamma for B: 0.5c. (0.5)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.7
