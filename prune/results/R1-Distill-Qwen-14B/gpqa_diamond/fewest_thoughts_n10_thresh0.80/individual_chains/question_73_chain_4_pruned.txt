Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Let's see... I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics, right? Because at high speeds, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Or wait, is it v1 and v2 in the same direction? So, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but using the relativistic formula.

So, the first astronaut's speed is 0.6c, and the second is 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at a relative speed. So let me plug those into the formula. Wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. The relative speed u is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)), but I'm not sure if I'm subtracting correctly. Oh wait, no, wait. If I'm calculating the speed of the second astronaut from the first's frame, then it's (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Or is it (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²))? Hmm, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, the correct formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). But I'm getting confused because I'm trying to find the relative speed between the two. Let me think. Let's say astronaut A is moving at v_A = 0.6c, and astronaut B at v_B = 0
