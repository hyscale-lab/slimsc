Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that in particle physics, bosons can decay into fermions if the interaction is allowed by the Lagrangian. The problem gives me the Lagrangian term, so I should start there.

The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is the interaction term between the boson X and the fermions. So, the X boson is interacting with these fermions. The variables here are probably fermion fields, and X is the boson field.

Wait, the problem says the mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find what fermion pairs X can decay into. Kinematically allowed decays would require that the energy is sufficient, meaning the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the heaviest fermion in the pair.

But wait, the fermions that X can interact with must be present in the Lagrangian. So I should figure out which fermions are included here. Let me look at the Lagrangian again. The term has ψ_f (psi_f), which probably stands for various fermions. The options given include things like b, s, u, d, tau, e, c, t, mu, etc. So I think the possible decay products depend on which fermions are present in the interaction.

Looking at the Lagrangian, I see that it's written as -λ_f f bar ψ f (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe the notation is that f represents different fermion types. So for each fermion f, the interaction term allows X to couple to pairs of that fermion.

So, the possible fermions that X can decay into would be all the fermions f for which the coupling λ_f is non-zero. So if, for example, the coupling includes up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top quarks, and maybe leptons like electrons, muons, taus, etc., then X can decay into any pair of these fermions as long as the energy is sufficient.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify which fermions are included in the Lagrangian. Hmm, maybe the notation f is meant to represent all possible fermions. Or perhaps the Lagrangian term is written in a way that f is a specific fermion, and the overall term sums over all possible f. Oh, right, in the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction terms are written with a sum over fermion species. So in this case, maybe X can interact with any fermion, but which ones are actually present in the model?

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify. Oh, perhaps the interaction is such that X couples to all fermions. So for each fermion species, the coupling is present. So, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair provided the energy is sufficient.

But then, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, the possible decays would involve fermions whose individual masses are less than or equal to 3 GeV (since each would need to be at most half the mass of X for the decay to be possible).

So, let's list all possible fermions and their masses:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (mu): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV (but wait, I think s is around 95 MeV, which is about 0.095 GeV)
Wait no, wait, I think the masses are higher. Let me think. The masses of the quarks vary a lot, but I remember the up and down are the lightest, then strange, then charm, bottom, top.

Wait, perhaps I should get the approximate masses:

Electron: 0.000511 GeV
Muon: 0.105 GeV
Tau: 1.777 GeV

Quarks:

u: ~2 MeV (<< 1 GeV)
d: ~3-5 MeV
s: ~95-105 MeV
c: ~1.27 GeV
b: ~4.1-4.7 GeV (so about 4.5 GeV)
t: 173 GeV

Leptons:

So, the X has a mass of 6 GeV. So for a fermion f, 2m_f <= m_X.

So m_f <= 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses:

- e: 0.0005 GeV: yes, 0.001 GeV is way below 3 GeV.
- mu: 0.105 GeV: yes.
- tau: ~1.78 GeV: yes, 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 6 GeV is the mass of X. So for a fermion f, the mass must be m_f <= m_X / 2 = 3 GeV. So tau is 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So decay into tau-antitau is allowed.

Wait, but wait, the tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV. That's less than 6 GeV, so yes, allowed.

So possible fermions are e, mu, tau, and the quarks.

Now, for the quarks: which ones have m_f <= 3 GeV?

u: 2 MeV, yes.

d: 3-5 MeV, yes.

s: ~100 MeV, yes.

c: ~1.27 GeV, yes.

b: ~4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So 4.5 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass (
