Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh right, the interaction term probably looks something like L_int = λ f f-bar ψ_f (X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe that's not the exact form, but the key point is that the X boson is coupling to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decay modes of X at the lowest order. So, the decays would involve X boson decaying into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because the interaction term suggests that X is coupling to fermions, so its decay products would be fermions.

So the first thing I need to figure out is what fermions have a mass less than or equal to half of the X boson's mass. Because for a particle to decay into a pair of particles, each of those must have a mass less than or equal to half the parent's mass. Because if the parent's mass is M, each daughter must have mass m ≤ M/2.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but particles can be massless as well. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product. So I need to list all the fermions whose mass is ≤ 3 GeV.

Let me think about the known fermion masses. The charged leptons: electrons are about 0.511 MeV, so way under. Muons are about 105.7 MeV, still way under. Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so that's under 3 GeV.

Now the quarks: up and down are the lightest. The up quark is about 2.2 MeV, down is about 4.7 MeV. So both are way under 3 GeV. Next, strange is about 95 MeV, which is also under 3 GeV. Then, charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. The bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So bottom quarks can't be decay products because 4.5 > 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the top quark is way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so definitely not. So the possible quarks are u, d, s, and c. But wait, the bottom quark is too heavy. So the possible quarks are up, down, strange,
