Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A through D, each with different dependencies on plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So a star with a parallax of 1 pc would be 1 parsec away, and one with 0.5 pc would be twice as far, right?

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if stars are uniformly distributed, does that mean their distances are uniformly spread? Or is it uniform in some other way?

Wait, no. Uniform distribution in the sky might not mean uniform in distance. Because in the actual universe, stars aren't uniformly distributed in space, but here the assumption is that they are. So let's think about this.

Parallax (p) is 1/distance (d), so d = 1/p. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, that would mean that the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to that volume. But since we're looking at parallax, which depends on distance, the distribution in parallax space might not be uniform.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So for a given parallax range, like from p to p + dp, how many stars are there?

I think
