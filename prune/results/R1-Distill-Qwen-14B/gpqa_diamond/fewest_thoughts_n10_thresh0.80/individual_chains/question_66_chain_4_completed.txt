Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model using higher-dimensional operators, right? The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options given are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, while Poincare symmetry adds translations as well. So Poincare includes Lorentz and translational symmetry. If an operator must respect Lorentz, does that mean it's part of Poincare? Because if all operators respect Lorentz, and assume they're also translationally invariant, then Poincare would be respected too.

But wait, do effective operators in SMEFT necessarily respect Poincare? Well, I think any renormalizable theory would have Poincare symmetry, but SMEFT is an effective theory. Are all its operators required to respect Poincare? Or can they violate it in some way?

Wait, another angle: SMEFT is constructed to preserve the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has Lorentz, gauge (like SU(2), SU(3), U(1)), and some other symmetries like CP. But wait, the Standard Model doesn't respect CP in general because there's CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. Oh, but SMEFT's operators are added in a way that preserves the SM's gauge symmetry, but what about other symmetries?

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must all operators respect. So when building SMEFT, the operators are classified based on the SM fields and their symmetries. But in terms of Lorentz symmetry, all terms must be Lorentz scalars. Because each operator is a Lorentz scalar. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely respected.

What about Poincare? Well, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. For a theory to be a Poincare-invariant, it must have a conserved energy-momentum tensor and be translationally invariant. Since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's built in a way that's Lorentz-invariant but it's also local. So I think effective operators are local, which would imply Poincare symmetry. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but wait. Do all operators in SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it that the theory as a whole respects it, but individual operators might not? No, because each operator must be a Lorentz scalar, which would mean that they're part of a Poincare-invariant theory. Because each term is a Lorentz scalar and the interactions are local, so the full theory respects Poincare. So each operator on its own must respect Lorentz, but Poincare is a global symmetry (in the sense of translation invariance). So maybe each operator doesn't need to have Poincare, but the theory as a whole does. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz, so Lorentz symmetry is definitely required. What about Poincare? Well, each operator is a local term, so it's invariant under Lorentz transformations. But translation symmetry (Poincare) would require that the operator is the same everywhere in space. But each operator is a local term, so perhaps they don't individually have to respect translation symmetry, but the overall theory does. Or perhaps the operators are constructed in a way that makes the theory Poincare invariant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the theory requires.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, but it's also a local theory, so I think operators are constructed to respect Poincare as well. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So the first two are correct.

What about CP and CPT symmetries? The Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry overall, but SMEFT operators can violate CP. For example, some operators can have terms that explicitly break CP. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, option 3 (CP) is not a symmetry that all operators must respect.

But wait, what about CPT symmetry? The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be invariant under CPT. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT. So if all operators respect Lorentz (which they do), then the theory as a whole must respect CPT. But does each operator individually have to respect CPT? Or can they violate CPT as long as the whole theory doesn't? Hmm.

Wait, in QFT, the CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The CPT theorem says that a Lorentz-invariant theory must be invariant under CPT. So if the theory (as a whole) is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT. However, individual operators can violate individual symmetries like C, P, or T, but the combination must hold.

So for example, an operator might change under C, but if another operator changes in a way that the sum respects CPT, the overall theory would still have CPT symmetry.

But wait, in the context of SMEFT, each operator is a scalar under Lorentz but could have certain transformation properties under other symmetries. But for the theory to be CPT-invariant, certain conditions must hold, such as operators being paired with their CPT conjugates. However, if you have an operator that doesn't have a CPT conjugate (unlikely), that could be a problem.

But the question is, must all operators respect CPT symmetry? Or is it that the theory must be CPT-invariant, but individual operators can have arbitrary transformation properties as long as the sum respects it. Hmm, perhaps the operators don't have to each respect CPT, but the combined theory does. Therefore, perhaps the individual operators do not have to respect CPT symmetry. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: if a theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant. So if all operators respect Lorentz, then the theory must respect CPT. So perhaps the operators themselves must be such that their sum respects CPT. So each operator can have any CPT properties, but the overall theory must respect it.

But in the SMEFT, when you write down operators, they are classified by their quantum numbers, including their CPT properties. So perhaps each operator must have a definite CPT transformation property, but the operators as a whole must form a CPT-invariant set. So the operators may not individually have to respect CPT, but the collection must.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries all operators must respect. So if an operator doesn't respect CPT, but the theory does, because other terms compensate, then the operator doesn't individually have to respect CPT. So perhaps CPT is not a symmetry that each operator must respect, but the theory as a whole must.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators". So if an operator does not respect CPT, but the overall theory does, then the operator doesn't need to respect CPT on its own. Hence, CPT isn't a symmetry that each operator must individually respect; the theory does, but that's a separate issue.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to structure my thoughts:

1. Lorentz symmetry: All operators must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is definitely correct.

2. Poincare symmetry: Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant, local theory, each operator must be a scalar and the theory must be translationally invariant. But do all operators themselves have to respect Poincare? Or is the theory as a whole Poincare-invariant because the terms are local and the fields are translation-invariant? I think each operator is a local term, so they must respect Poincare. Because translation invariance implies that the Lagrangian is the same everywhere, so each operator is a translation-invariant term. So 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: The Standard Model doesn't respect CP, and SMEFT can have terms that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP. Therefore, 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: The theory as a whole must respect CPT due to Lorentz invariance. But individual operators can have terms that violate C, P, or T, as long as their combination respects CPT. However, the question is about whether each operator must respect CPT. Since the operator can have any CPT property as long as the whole theoryâ€™s terms are CPT invariant, the individual operators don't have to respect CPT. Therefore, 4 is not a symmetry that all operators must respect. Wait, wait. Or perhaps the operators must respect CPT. Because if the theory is required to be CPT-invariant, then any operator must come with its CPT conjugate, or not? Hmm, perhaps not. For example, in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, you can have terms that break a symmetry but the overall theory remains symmetric. So, in this case, SMEFT operators can have individual terms that violate CPT, but their sum must respect CPT. Therefore, the individual operators don't have to each respect CPT. So 4 isn't a symmetry that all operators must respect.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another angle: the CPT theorem says that in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the theory must be CPT-invariant. So if the SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant. So the operators must be arranged so that the entire theory is CPT-invariant. But each individual operator can have any CPT properties, as long as the total Lagrangian is CPT-invariant. So, for instance, an operator could be CPT-even or CPT-odd. If an operator is CPT-odd, it must come with another term that cancels its effect in a way that the total is CPT-invariant. But the individual operator doesn't have to be CPT-invariant. Therefore, each operator doesn't have to respect CPT.

So, considering all this, the symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2). So looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, option C is 1,2,4. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 is not required. Hmm.

Wait, option C is 1,2,4. So C says that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But earlier I thought that CPT isn't a requirement for individual operators, so option C would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must be CPT-invariant. But each operator can have any CPT properties as long as the overall theory's Lagrangian is CPT-invariant. So, each operator doesn't need to be CPT-invariant on its own.

Therefore, option 4 (CPT) is not a symmetry that all operators must individually respect. So the correct symmetries are 1 and 2. Looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2

C) 1,2,4

So according to this, the correct answer would include 1 and 2 only. So option A.

Wait, but wait another thought: does Poincare symmetry automatically follow from Lorentz symmetry in the context of SMEFT? Because Poincare is Lorentz plus translations. And any local Lagrangian is translation invariant, so perhaps the operators themselves are automatically respecting translation invariance, hence Poincare.

So the correct answer must include 1 and 2. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically respected because the operators are local. So all operators in SMEFT are local, which implies translation invariance, hence Poincare. Therefore, 1 and 2 are both correct.

So the correct answer should be option A (1,2). But wait, let me check another resource for confirmation.

From what I recall, the SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars and gauge invariant. So Lorentz symmetry is a must. Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations, but in the case of SMEFT, the operators are local, which implies translation invariance. So each operator is a local term, so they respect Poincare symmetry as well.

So the correct answer must include 1 and 2. So looking at the options, option A (1,2) is correct. However, I'm also recalling that the Poincare group includes the entire spacetime symmetry, but perhaps sometimes just Lorentz is considered separately. Hmm, but I'm pretty sure that in SMEFT, operators are constructed to respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, but then what about option C, which includes 1,2,4. If CPT is required, then that would be another consideration.

Wait, but the CPT theorem applies to the theory as a whole. So each operator doesn't have to respect CPT, but the sum of all operators must. Therefore, CPT is not a symmetry that each operator must respect. So the answer should not include 4.

Thus, the correct answer is option A: 1 and 2.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model while incorporating higher-dimensional corrections. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars because the theory is Lorentz-invariant. This is a fundamental requirement for the consistency of the theory. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) is correct.

2. **PoincarÃ© Symmetry**: PoincarÃ© symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a local effective field theory, it is automatically translation-invariant, and thus all operators respect PoincarÃ© symmetry (2). Therefore, PoincarÃ© symmetry (2) is correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation, and SMEFT allows for operators that explicitly violate CP. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is not a symmetry that all operators in SMEFT must respect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, the theory as a whole must respect CPT symmetry. However, individual operators do not necessarily have to respect CPT symmetry on their own, as long as the overall theory remains CPT-invariant. Therefore, CPT symmetry (4) is not a symmetry that all operators must individually respect.

From this analysis, the symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect are Lorentz symmetry (1) and PoincarÃ© symmetry (2). The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
