Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's only got dx and dy terms. So the space described here is two-dimensional. Oh wait, but the question mentions a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like in hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, but the metric is written in terms of x and y, so maybe it's embedded in three dimensions, but the metric itself is two-dimensional. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, radius 2? But the metric has 4 in the denominator. Oh, 4 is (2)^2, so maybe the radius is connected to that.

So, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me see. To find the area, I probably need to compute the area using this metric. In two dimensions, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric is diagonal since only dx² and dy² terms are present. So the metric tensor components are g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 -
