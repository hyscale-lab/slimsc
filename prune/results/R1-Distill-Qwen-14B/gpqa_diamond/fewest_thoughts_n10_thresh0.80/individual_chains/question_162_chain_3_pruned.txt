Okay, so I've got this metric here and I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, wait, first I need to understand what this metric represents. The metric is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). That looks a bit like a conformally flat metric because it's a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). 

Wait, but what does the denominator look like? The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Oh, so that's similar to the equation of a circle or a sphere. For example, in 2D, x² + y² = r² is a circle with radius r. So here, 4 is like r², so r would be 2. So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²) = 4 - r², but wait, r here would be sqrt(x² + y²). So the denominator becomes 4 - r² where r is the radial coordinate in 2D. 

So when does the denominator become zero? When r² =4, so r=2. That suggests that at r=2, the denominator goes to zero, so the metric blows up. That probably means there's a curvature singularity there. But how does that relate to the pseudosphere? Pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, right? Like hyperbolic space.

Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface in 3D, but here we're dealing with a 2D metric. Oh wait, maybe it's a 2D
