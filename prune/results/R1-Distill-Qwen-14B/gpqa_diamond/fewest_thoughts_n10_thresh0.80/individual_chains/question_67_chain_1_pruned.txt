Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, the problem says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, okay, I remember that the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are l1 and l2 for each electron. Here, both are 1, which makes sense since p orbitals have l=1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability of both L1z and L2z having eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait, so each electron's orbital angular momentum along z is being measured. The possible eigenvalues for an orbital angular momentum Lz are m * ħ, where m can range from -l to +l in integer steps. For each electron with l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the eigenvalues for each L1z and L2z are -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But the question is about the probability that both are -ħ. So, what's the state?

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this is a product state in terms of total angular momentum. Wait, no, it's a coupled state, which means it's expressed in terms of total angular momentum. So, the state is already in a particular coupling scheme.

Wait, the state |l1, l2, L, M> is a coupled state where L is the total orbital angular momentum, and M is the z-component. So, in this case, L=2 and M=-1. So the total orbital angular momentum is 2ħ, and the z-component is -ħ.

But in this state, the individual electrons' angular momenta are combined. So, we're looking to express this state in terms of the product states of individual L1z and L2z. Because when you measure L1z and L2z, the state will collapse into an eigenstate of both. So, the probability comes from the expansion of the coupled state into the product basis.

So, the coupled state is a linear combination of product states where each product state is |m1, m2>, where m1 is the z-component of the first electron, and m2 of the second.

Wait, but how do we express |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> in terms of the product states?

I think the total state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of states where m1 + m2 = M = -1. So, the possible (m1, m2)
