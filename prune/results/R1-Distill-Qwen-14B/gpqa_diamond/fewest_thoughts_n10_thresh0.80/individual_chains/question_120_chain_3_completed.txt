Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, I think it's about the distribution of stars as a function of parallax. Like, how many stars are there in a certain range of parallax values.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I remember something about flux or density in space. Oh wait, maybe it's about the number density of stars at a certain distance. Because if stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (stars per volume) would be constant. But as you go further away, the volume increases, so the number of stars in a shell at a certain distance depends on the surface area of that shell.

Wait, let me think. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d+dd would be the surface area of the shell (which is 4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dd, and the number density (n) which is constant. So number of stars, N = 4πn d² dd. But since plx (p) is 1/d, d = 1/p. So substituting that in, N = 4πn (1/p²)² dp? Wait, no, d squared would be (1/p²), so N = 4πn (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's approach it step by step. Let's say the number of stars per unit volume is n, and it's constant. So the number of stars in a small volume element dV is n dV. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π d² dd. So dN = n * 4π d² dd. But since plx p = 1/d, d = 1/p. So substituting, dN = n *4π (1/p^2) (1/p^2 dp) )?

Wait, no, wait. Because dd is a small change in distance, and when you change variables from d to p, since p =1/d, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the substitution should include that. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of stars per unit parallax. Since the parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the number of stars in a given range of parallax dp would depend on how much volume is at that parallax.

Let's see, for a given parallax p, the distance d is 1/p. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) and the thickness of the shell (dd). But since we're considering a change in parallax, we need to express this in terms of p.

So, dN = 4π d² n dd. But since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. Also, dd = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're dealing with ranges, we'll take the magnitude.

Substituting d=1/p and dd = (1/p²) dp, we get:

dN = 4π (1/p^2)² * n * (1/p²) dp

Wait, no. Wait, 4π d² is 4π (1/p^2), and dd is (1/p^2) dp. So,

dN = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp * n

So dN = 4π n (1/p^4) dp

Hmm, so the number of stars per unit parallax would be proportional to 1/p^4. So dN/dp = 4πn / p^4.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So the number of stars in a small range dp is dN, which is proportional to 1/p^4 dp. So the number per unit range (dN/dp) would be proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but looking at the options: A is ~1/plx^4, which would be 1/p^4. So the option A would be correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. Because I'm considering the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d, which corresponds to a parallax p. The volume of the shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars is 4πd² n dd. Since d = 1/p, this becomes 4π (1/p^2) n dd. But dd can be expressed in terms of dp. Since p =1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd => dd = - p² dp. Again, ignoring the negative, we have dd= p² dp. Substituting back, dN = 4π (1/p²) n (p² dp) ) = 4π n dp. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply dN is proportional to dp, which would make the answer option C (~1/p^1). But that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, where did I go wrong. Let me re-do the substitution carefully.

dN = 4π d² n dd.

Express d in terms of p: d = 1/p. So d² = 1/p^2.

dd in terms of dp: Since p = 1/d, differentiating both sides: dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dp = - (1/p²) dp.

So, substitute into dN: dN = 4π (1/p²) * n * ( - 1/p² dp )

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but since we're considering an infinitesimal range, we can take the absolute value, so dN = 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

Thus, dN is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dN/dp) is ~ 1/p^4, which matches option A.

Wait, but that seems to be conflicting with my earlier alternative. What's going on here?

Let me think differently. Perhaps I can think in terms of the volume between two distances. Suppose we have a range of parallax from p to p + Δp. The corresponding distances are 1/(p+Δp) and 1/p. The volume of the shell between these two is 4π ( (1/p)^2 - (1/(p+Δp))^2 ) * (Δd), but wait, actually, for a thin shell, it's approximately 4π d² dd, where d is about 1/p, and dd is the change in distance. So, the number of stars in that shell is 4π d² n * dd.

But when you express dd in terms of Δp, since p =1/d, Δp is approximately - (1/d²) Δd → Δd = - d² Δp. So, dd = d² Δp. But d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p². So,

Number of stars N = 4π (1/p^2) n (1/p² Δp) ) = 4π n (1/p^4) Δp.

So again, N is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit Δp is ~1/p^4.

So the correct answer should be A, which is ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. The parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to the distance \( d \), given by \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell \( (4\pi d^2) \) and the number density of stars \( n \), such that:

\[
dN = 4\pi d^2 n \, dd.
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), we find \( d^2 = \frac{1}{p^2} \). Additionally, \( dd \) can be expressed in terms of \( dp \) using the relation \( p = \frac{1}{d} \), which gives \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting these into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) n \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right).
\]

Taking the magnitude (since we are interested in the absolute number of stars), we have:

\[
dN = 4\pi n \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
