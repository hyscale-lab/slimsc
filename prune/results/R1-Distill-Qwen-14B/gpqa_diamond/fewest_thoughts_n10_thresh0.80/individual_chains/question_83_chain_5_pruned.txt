Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So maybe I should calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.

Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, volume V1 is 20 cm³. We're adding 20 cm³ of water, so total volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 1/4, which is 0.0125 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's think about the moles. The volume of the diluted solution is 40 cm³, so moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) initially is 0.04 L * 0.0125 mol/L = 0.0005 mol. Moles of NaOH at equivalence would be same, so 0.0005 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5 cm³. Wait, wait, no, wait: wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, the diluted acetic acid is 40 cm³ of 0.0125 M. So moles = 0.0125 * (40/1000) = 0.0005 mol. Correct. The NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = n/M = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L, which is 5 cm³. So at equivalence point, 5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But the question is about pH at 25% titration and equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 1.25 cm³ (since 5 cm³ is 100%, so 25% is 1.25 cm³). So during the titration, when 1.25 cm³ of NaOH is added, that's the 25% point.

Now, let's tackle the two parts separately.

First, the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.00125 L = 0.000125 mol.

Since the moles of acetic acid initially is 0.0005 mol, after adding 0.000125 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left are 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 mol. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.000125 mol.

The total volume of the solution
