Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. I need to find out what compound X is from the options provided.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a base, often used in elimination reactions. So maybe compound X undergoes some kind of elimination when treated with this base. Oh! Like an epoxide ring opening? Or maybe it's a different kind of elimination, like forming a double bond.

Compound X's formula is C11H12O. Let me check the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Styryl is a vinyl benzene group. So oxirane is an epoxide. So the structure would be an epoxide connected to a styryl group, which has a substituent on the benzene. Wait, formula-wise, let's see. Styryl is C8H7. Then oxirane is O connected to two CH2 groups? Or maybe more carbons. Wait, oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So for 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, the structure is a styryl group attached to the epoxide. The styryl would be a benzene ring attached via a CH2CH2 group. Wait, no, styryl is CH2=CHPh. So the epoxide would be O in a three-membered ring with two CH2 groups. But wait, the formula of compound X is C11H12O. Let's calculate.

Styryl is C8H7. The oxirane would add two more carbons (from the epoxide ring) and an oxygen. Wait, no: the oxirane is an epoxide, so structure is O connected to two CH2 groups, but wait, no. The oxirane group is an epoxide, which is a three-membered ring: O connected to two adjacent CH2 groups. So the formula for oxirane part is C2H4O. So the entire compound would have the styryl (C8H7) plus the oxirane (C2H4O), making C10H11O. But compound X is C11H12O. Hmm, so that's one more carbon. Maybe the styryl has a methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, option A is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the styryl is CH2-CH(C6H4-4-Me). Let me count the carbons. Styryl is CH2=CH-(C6H4-Me). So the styryl group has 8 carbons (6 from benzene, 2 from the styryl part, plus the methyl makes it 8?), wait, no. Benzene is 6, the vinyl group is 2, and a methyl on the benzene would add one more. So styryl part is 6 (benzene) +2 (vinyl) +1 (methyl) = 9? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The formula for 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane would be: the oxirane is (CH2)2O. But no, the oxirane is a three-membered ring, so it's O connected to two CH2 groups. So the formula for oxirane is C2H4O. The styryl part is 4-methylstyryl, which is phenyl group with a CH2CH2 group attached? Wait, styryl is C6H5-CH2-CH2? No, wait, sty
