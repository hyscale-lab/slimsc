Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's try to work through it step by step.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to determine the major products for each, labeled A and B. Then, I'll match them with the options provided.

First, looking at reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, that's a benzene ring with a substituent. Let me draw this structure to visualize it better. The substituent is an oxygen connected to a CH2 group, which is then connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Breaking that down, the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain. Position 1 is where the substituent is attached. So, the structure would be: benzene-O-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, maybe I should write that more clearly. The substituent is OCH2-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 2. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is probably CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with double bond between C2 and C3? Alternatively, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- but as a substituent,
