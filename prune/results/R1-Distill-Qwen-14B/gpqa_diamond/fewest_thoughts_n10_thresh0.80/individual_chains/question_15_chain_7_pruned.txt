Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit detailed, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, so there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. So, transiting means when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, right? That's how the transit method detects planets.

They've already found these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives minimum masses and orbital periods. Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and their orbits are circular.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But wait, both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, even though one star is more massive, they have the same size. That probably means the more massive star is younger or perhaps hasn't expanded yet, but I'm not sure if that matters here.

So, the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula I vaguely remember is something like P = (R_star / a) * (something else?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, I think the transit probability (the chance that we see the planet pass in front of the star) is given by the formula:

P = (R_star / a) / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3))

Wait, no, maybe that's another formula. I'm not too confident. Alternatively, the probability might be proportional to (R_star / a), but scaled by some factors. Let me think again.

I think the probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a), but that's the geometric probability. The geometric probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But I also remember that this can be adjusted by the inclination. Wait, no, actually, the geometric probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. So, it's based on the size of the star relative to the size of the planet's orbit.

So
