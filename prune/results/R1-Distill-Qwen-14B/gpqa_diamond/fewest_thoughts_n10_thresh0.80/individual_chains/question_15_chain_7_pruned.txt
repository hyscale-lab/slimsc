Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet stuff, but let me think through this.

So the question says both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since it orbits faster.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is more massive—twice as much as Planet_2's. But since both stars have the same radius, that must mean that Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger. Wait, how does a star's mass affect its radius? Well, more massive stars are usually bigger, but in this case, both have the same radius. Hmm, maybe because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved. Evolved stars might expand, so if Planet_2's star is evolved (like a subgiant or something), it would have a larger radius but here it's same as Planet_1's, so maybe Planet_1's star is more main-sequence and has a higher mass.

But the key point here is the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the size of the star, and the orbital distance. The transit probability (p) is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else? Wait, no, the probability isn't just that. Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability of that is about R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, no, the formula I remember is that the transit probability is approximately (R_*/a)² * (1 + (R_p/R_*) ), but for Earth-sized planets and stars, R_p/R_* is small, so maybe we can approximate the transit probability as (R_* / a)^2 times a factor related to the inclination. Wait, no, perhaps the geometric probability is (R_star + R_planet)/a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star/a. But wait, I think the actual formula is (R_*/a) multiplied by the probability that the orbit is aligned in the right way.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, can't do that, but I'll try to recall. The probability of transit is given by (R_*/a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p/R_*)), but since R_p << R_*, it's approximately (R_*/a). But wait, no, that's not the exact formula. Oh right, the transit probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p/R_*)), which simplifies to (R_* + R_p) / a. But again, R_p is negligible, so it's approximately (R_*/a).

Wait, but I thought that the probability is higher when the star is smaller relative to the planet's orbit. So for a given planet, if the star is smaller, then R_*/a is larger, meaning higher probability.

But in this case, both planets have the same host star radius. Both R_* are the same, right? The question says both host stars have the same radii. So R_* is same for both. So the only variable is the semi-major axis, a.

Wait, but a depends on the orbital period. Since both planets have circular orbits, we can use Kepler's third law. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P and the star's mass M via P² = (4π²/G M) * a³. So for each planet, a³ is proportional to (M * P²). So a is proportional to (M)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

Wait, but let's compute a for each planet. Because we can find a in terms of M and P.

Kepler's third law in the form a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). Since G and π are constants, for each planet, a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1:
M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2)
P1 = P2 / 3 (since period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's)
So a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ]^(1/3)
= [ 2 M2 * P2²/(9) ]^(1/3)
= ( (2/9) M2 P2² )^(1/3)
= (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3)

For Planet_2:
a2 = [ M2 * P2^2 ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3) / (M2 P2²)^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3). Let me compute that.

Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08, so 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Wait, no, because a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2. Let me compute that.

(2/9) = 0.2222
Cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2. Since a is the semi-major axis, which is the distance from the star. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Now, the transit probability depends on (R_*/a)². Wait, no, the transit probability is the geometric probability, which is (R_* + R_p) / a. But as R_p is negligible, it's R_* / a. But since both R_* are the same, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So the probability is proportional to 1/a. So for Planet_1, which has a1 ≈ 0.606 a2, the probability is higher because a is smaller. So probability_1 = (R_*)/a1, probability_2 = (R_*)/a2.

Since a1 is 0.606 a2, probability_1 = (R_*/a2) * (1/0.606) ≈ (1/0.606) * (R_*/a2) ) → about 1.65 times the probability of Planet_2.

Because Planet_1's a is smaller, its probability is higher.

Wait, but let me think again. The transit probability is higher when a is smaller, because the star's apparent size is larger relative to the planet's orbit. So for a given star size, a planet with a smaller a has a higher chance of transiting. 

So in this case, since a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has
