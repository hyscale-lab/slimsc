Okay, so I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2 has a molecular weight of, let's see, 12*9 + 1*11 +14 +16*2= 108 +11 +14 +32= 165 g/mol.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide has a structure with a benzene ring, an amide group (CONH2). But 3-ethoxy would add an ethoxy group at the meta position. The formula would be C9H10O2N, but wait, let me check. Benzamide is C7H7NO2, so adding an ethoxy (C2H5O) would make it C9H8O2N. Hmm, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's different. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, molecular formula for option A: Benzamide is C7H7NO2. 3-Ethoxy would replace a hydrogen with an OCH2CH3. So the formula would be C7 + C2H5O (since ethoxy is OCH2CH3). So that's C9H9NO3? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-calculate.

Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Molecular formula: C7H7NO2. 3-ethoxy would replace a hydrogen on the benzene with an OCH2CH3 group. So the new formula would be C6H4-OCH2CH3-CONH2. So that's C6+3 (from ethoxy) + (CONH2 is 2 carbons?) Wait, no. The benzamide has 7 carbons (C6 from benzene, CO, NH2). Wait, no, benzamide is C7H7NO2: C6 (benzene) + CO (that's one O, and one C) + NH2. So adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would add 2 more C's. So total C: 6 + 1 (CO) + 2 (ethoxy) = 9 C. H: benzene has 5 H when substituted (since benzamide has two substituents: the CO and an ethoxy?), wait, substituting what?

Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So the benzene ring has one substituent (the CONH2 group). If it's 3-ethoxy, that would be another substituent. So the benzene is 1,3-disubstituted. So the formula would be C7 (from benzamide) + C2 (ethoxy) = C9. H: benzene has 4 H (since two substituents), but let me count. Benzene has 6 H normally. Each substituent (like CONH2 and OCH2CH3) would take a position. So for benzamide, the benzene has 5 H (since one is replaced by CONH2). Adding another substituent (ethoxy at 3 position) would take another H, so 4 H on benzene. Then the ethoxy group has 5 H (OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 groups, so 5 H in total: each CH2 is 2 H, but O is attached to CH2, so the structure is OCH2CH3. So 2+3=5 H? Wait, OCH2CH3 has 5 H? No, OCH2CH3 has 5 H? Wait, no. The ethoxy group is O-CH2-CH3. So the CH2 has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H. So total of 5 H in the ethoxy group. Then the CONH2 group: the amide has a NH2
