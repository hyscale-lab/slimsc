Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The uncertainty is ΔP_z, and I need to calculate it using the given matrices.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula:

ΔA = sqrt( <A²> - <A>² )

Where A is the operator in question, in this case P_z. So I'll need to compute the expectation value of P_z squared and the square of the expectation value of P_z, then take the square root of their difference.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but wait a second. The state is given as the eigenstate of P_x. Since P_x is an observable, its eigenstates are the basis states for which it's diagonal. But the basis vectors provided are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, because the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state |ψ> is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in this state.

Wait, but to compute <P_z>, I can just take the inner product of |ψ> with P_z acting on |ψ>, right? Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal in this basis (because the basis vectors are P_z's eigenvectors), the expectation value <P_z> is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.

Wait, that might be more straightforward. Because if the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, then each basis vector |n> corresponds to a specific eigenvalue. So the state |ψ> can be expressed as a linear combination of these |n> states, and the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues weighted by the square of the coefficients' magnitudes.

Wait, but let me verify that. Let's think about the P_z matrix given. The matrix for P_z is diagonal: first element is ħ, the second is 0, third is -ħ. So the basis vectors are [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], each corresponding to eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the state |ψ> is written as a column vector in this basis. So the components of |ψ> are the coefficients of each basis vector. So the first component is -1/2, the second is 1/√2, third is -1/2.

So the expectation value <P_z> is the sum of each component squared (times the eigenvalue for that basis vector).

So let's compute that. The eigenvalues for each basis vector are:

- First basis vector: eigenvalue ħ.

- Second: 0.

- Third: -ħ.

So the coefficients are:

c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

The probabilities are |c1|², |c2|², |c3|².

So |c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c3|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ).

Calculating that: (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. So <P_z> is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the average value of P_z in this state is zero.

Now I need to compute <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the squared eigenvalues are (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So <P_z²> is the sum of |cn|² * (eigenvalue squared for each state).

So <P_z²> = |c1|² * (ħ)^2 + |c2|² * 0 + |c3|² * (ħ)^2.

Which is (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, putting into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - (<P_z>)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ.

Which is (ħ / sqrt(2)).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculations.

For <P_z>, yes, each term is |c|^2 times eigenvalue. c1 is -1/2, so |c1|²=1/4, eigenval 1 is ħ, so 1/4 * ħ. Similarly, c3 is -1/2, |c3|²=1/4, eigenval is -ħ, so 1/4 * (-ħ). So when you add, they cancel each other, leaving zero. Correct.

For <P_z²>, each |c|² multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2. So c1's term is (1/4) * ħ², c2's is 0, c3's is (1/4) ħ². So sum is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Thus, the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, that's option B: ħ/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me think again: another approach is to compute <P_z> using the matrix multiplication. Let me try that as a cross-check.

The operator P_z is a diagonal matrix:

P_z = diag( ħ, 0, -ħ )

The state |ψ> is the column vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So <P_z> is the inner product of ψ† P_z ψ.

Which is ψ† * P_z * ψ.

So compute each term:

First term: ( -1/2 ) * ħ * ( -1/2 ) = (1/4) ħ.

Second term: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

Third term: ( -1/2 ) * (-ħ) * ( -1/2 ) = (1/4) * (-ħ) * (-1) → wait, no. Let me compute each component.

Wait no, perhaps I should compute it correctly. So the matrix multiplication is:

P_z |ψ> is [ ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), (-ħ)*(-1/2) ]^T.

Which is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, the inner product of |ψ>† (which is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]) with P_z |ψ> is:

( -1/2 )*(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)*0 + ( -1/2 )*( ħ/2 )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/(4)

Second term: 0

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = - ħ/(4)

Sum: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. So <P_z> is zero. Correct.

Now, <P_z²> is ψ† P_z^2 ψ.

P_z squared is diag( ħ², 0, ħ² )

So P_z^2 |ψ> is [ (ħ^2)(-1/2), 0, (ħ^2)(-1/2) ]^T.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute P_z^2:

Since P_z is diagonal, P_z^2 will have elements (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → so diag( ħ², 0, ħ² )

So P_z^2 |ψ> is:

[ ħ²*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), ħ²*(-1/2) ]^T.

Which is [ - ħ²/2, 0, - ħ²/2 ].

Now, the inner product ψ† * P_z^2 |ψ> is:

( -1/2 )* (-ħ²/2 ) + (1/√2)*0 + ( -1/2 ) * (- ħ²/2 )

Each term:

First term: (1/2) * (ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/(4)

Second term: 0

Third term: (1/2) * ( ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/(4)

Sum: ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So <P_z²> is ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2 ), which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the variance another way. Let me think: since the state is in an eigenstate of P_x, but the question is about P_z, which doesn't commute with P_x. So the uncertainty would be non-zero, and it seems to match what we calculated.

So the answer should be B) ħ/√2.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state $|\psi\rangle$, represented as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$), and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $|\psi\rangle$ are:

- $c_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, so $|c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$,
- $c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, so $|c_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$,
- $c_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, so $|c_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Substituting:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot (\lambda_i)^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
