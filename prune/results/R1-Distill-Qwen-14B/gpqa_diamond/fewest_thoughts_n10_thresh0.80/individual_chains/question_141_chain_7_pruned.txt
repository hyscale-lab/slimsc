Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, I think that's a typo. Because benzene only has six carbons. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Because 'd' might stand for four substituents, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, but the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Or maybe the 'd' is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 1-bromobenzene with two methyl groups; like 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but that's just toluene with a bromo at position 1. Wait, but the question says 2-d, which is confusing.

Oh wait, perhaps the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because 'd' probably refers to two substituents. Or maybe the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So let's imagine that.

So the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the benzene ring has a Br at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Wait, or is it positions 2 and 4? No, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the Br is at position 1, then positions 2 and 4 are adjacent and opposite. Wait, no. Position 1 is a carbon, then moving clockwise, position 2 is next to 1, position 3 is opposite, then 4 is next to 3, 5 is next to 4, and 6 is next to 5 and back to 1.

So in the case of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the substituents would be at positions 1 (Br), 2 (Me), and 4 (Me). That's a meta arrangement for the methyl groups relative to each other. Wait, no. Position 2 and 4 are separated by two carbons, so
