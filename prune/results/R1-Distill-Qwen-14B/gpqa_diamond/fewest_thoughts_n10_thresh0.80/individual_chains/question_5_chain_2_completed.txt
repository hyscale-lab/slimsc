Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's think through it step by step.

The problem says the operator is called P, and it's a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. The question is asking for the eigenvector of P in an arbitrary direction n that lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector, and we're looking for its eigenvector. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, when you have a vector operator, you can represent it using the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, right?

Let me recall. The Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are 2x2 matrices. For example, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So each component of P is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix.

So, P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) = (ħ/2 σ_x, ħ/2 σ_y, ħ/2 σ_z).

Now, the operator in an arbitrary direction n: since n is in the x-z plane, it's of the form (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be with the z-axis. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P·n would be the dot product of P with n, which is (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ).

Wait, but wait a second. The operator P for a spin-½ particle is given by (ħ/2)σ · n, where n is a unit vector. So the eigenvalues of this operator are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the spin-up state along n.

So the eigenvector we're looking for is the spin-up state along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. The spin-up state can be written in terms of the eigenstates of σ_z, which are |↑⟩ = [1; 0] and |↓⟩ = [0; 1].

Alternatively, the eigenvector can be expressed using spherical coordinates. For a direction n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), the spin-up state is usually written as [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T. But in this problem, since n is in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π? Wait, no, if n is in the x-z plane, then φ is either 0 or π, because the y-component is zero. So φ=0 would be along the positive x-axis, and φ=π along the negative x-axis. But wait, the problem says "arbitrary direction in x-z plane", so I think φ can be anything, but in our case, since n is in x-z, the angle φ is either 0 or π. Hmm, maybe no, actually, in the x-z plane, the direction can be any angle. Wait, no, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0, so any direction in that plane will have φ=0 or φ=π, depending on whether it's along the positive x or negative x. Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the angles wrong. Let me think. The standard spherical coordinates have θ as the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ as the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So for a direction in the x-z plane, φ can be 0 or π. Because points in the x-z plane have their projection onto the y-axis zero. So the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). Wait, no, if φ is zero, then the x component is maximum, and if φ is π, then x is negative. But since in the problem, it's an arbitrary direction in x-z, so φ can be arbitrary, but the y-component is zero. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the direction n is given as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in x-z, the y-component is zero. So for any θ, but φ=0. So the spin-up state along this direction would be [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T. But since φ is zero (as it's along x-z plane), the state becomes [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. But wait, the eigenstates are for the operator P·n, which is (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvectors by actually diagonalizing the matrix. Let's see.

So the operator in the direction n is (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ). Let's write that out.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So multiplying by (ħ/2):

P·n = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

Wait, let me compute that. So σ_x sinθ is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and σ_z cosθ is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. So adding them gives:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. Then multiply by ħ/2.

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

The eigenvalues of this matrix are ±(ħ/2), because the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1, so multiplied by ħ/2 gives ±ħ/2.

So the eigenvector we're looking for is the one with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

To find the eigenvector, we can solve (P·n - (ħ/2)I ) |v> = 0.

So let's write the matrix P·n - (ħ/2)I:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ].

Wait, no, the identity matrix is multiplied by 1, but (ħ/2) times the identity would be [[ħ/2, 0], [0, ħ/2]]. So the matrix P·n is [[ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ], [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ].

Then, subtract (ħ/2) from the diagonal elements to form (P·n - (ħ/2) I):

[ (ħ/2)(cosθ -1), (ħ/2) sinθ ],
[ (ħ/2) sinθ, (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1) ].

So the matrix is:

[ (cosθ -1), sinθ ] top row,
[ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] bottom row,

each element multiplied by (ħ/2).

But since (ħ/2) is a common factor, we can factor it out when solving the equation. So the system becomes:

(cosθ -1) * a + sinθ * b = 0,

sinθ * a + (-cosθ -1) * b = 0.

We can write this as a homogeneous system. Let's write the equations without the (ħ/2) factor:

( (cosθ - 1) ) a + ( sinθ ) b = 0,

( sinθ ) a + ( -cosθ - 1 ) b = 0.

We can write this as:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation 1,

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0 → equation 2.

Let me try solving for a and b.

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b.

But let's compute [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ].

Note that cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

a = [ - [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [ -2 sin²(theta/2) ] ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels with 2.

So a = [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( sin²(theta/2) ) ] b

Simplify:

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b → a = cot(theta/2) b.

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Let me choose b = 1 for simplicity. Then a = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express the ratio a/b = cot(theta/2). So the ratio is cot(theta/2), which means that a = cot(theta/2) b.

Alternatively, let me write the eigenvector as [a, b]^T.

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

Perhaps to make it more symmetric, I can write the eigenvector as:

a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2).

Wait, let me check that.

Because if a = cos(theta/2), and b = sin(theta/2), then a/b = cot(theta/2), which matches the previous ratio. So that works.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait a minute: when I compute a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2), then the condition from equation 1 is:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Let me substitute:

(cosθ -1) cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = ?

Hmm, using trigonometric identities, perhaps. Let's see:

We can write (cosθ -1) = -2 sin²(theta/2),
and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

(-2 sin²(theta/2)) cos(theta/2) + (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) sin(theta/2) 

= -2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + 2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2) 

= 0.

Which satisfies equation 1. Similarly for equation 2:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) + (- (cos(theta) + 1)) sin(theta/2)

= 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - (2 cos²(theta/2)) sin(theta/2)

Wait, let me compute each part:

sinθ a = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2).

(-cosθ -1) b = [ - (cos theta +1) ] sin(theta/2) = [ - ( (1 - 2 sin²(theta/2)) + 1 ) ] sin(theta/2) = [ - ( 2 - 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] sin(theta/2) = [ -2 (1 - sin²(theta/2)) ] sin(theta/2) = [ -2 cos²(theta/2) ] sin(theta/2).

So sum is 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) = 0.

So both equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But wait, the operator P is dimensionless? Or does it have units? Wait, the operator's components are given as P_x = (ħ/2) * the matrix, so the matrix itself has units of 1. So when we talk about the eigenvector, it's just a vector in Hilbert space, so the components are dimensionless complex numbers.

But looking at the options, some have ħ in them. Hmm, but wait, the eigenvector is a state vector, so it should be dimensionless. So perhaps the options with ħ are incorrect because they would have units. So let's look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found. So that's option C.

Wait but let me check the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Yes.

But wait, another thought: the eigenvector is only determined up to a phase. So the state could be multiplied by any scalar of modulus 1 (e^{iφ}), but in the options, some have additional factors like e^{i phi}.

Looking back, in the general case, the eigenvector can be written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T, where phi is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane, but in our problem, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi? Or perhaps the direction is given in the x-z plane, so the spin state can have a phase factor which depends on the direction.

Wait, but in our case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so the state should be real? Or does it have an overall phase factor?

Wait, no, because the operator P·n is Hermitian, so the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. Let me see.

The matrix P·n is Hermitian since it's of the form (ħ/2) (σ·n), and σ·n is Hermitian because n is a real unit vector. So the eigenvectors can be chosen real.

So in our case, the eigenvector is real, so the second component is sin(theta/2), not multiplied by e^{i phi}.

So looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → this matches.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → that's for a different parameterization, perhaps.

Other options have sqrt factors, but our result doesn't.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem asks for the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the direction can vary, but the eigenvector's form is general.

Wait, but why is option C the right one? Let me think about the possible options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the problem says "the normalized eigenvector", so our vector is already normalized since cos^2 + sin^2 = 1.

So option C is a possible correct answer. Let me check the other options.

Option A: (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ) → but these have ħ, which is not correct for a state vector.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin theta) → that's a different parameterization, probably for a different operator, like the orbital angular momentum, but for spin-½, it's different.

Option D: (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)) → again, has ħ, which is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices, and its components are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle with respect to the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the Pauli matrices, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ must satisfy the system of equations derived from this matrix. Solving these equations, we find that the components of the eigenvector are proportional to:

\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.  
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the derived eigenvector form.  
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector exactly.  
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$ and incorrect normalization factors.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.

Answer: C
