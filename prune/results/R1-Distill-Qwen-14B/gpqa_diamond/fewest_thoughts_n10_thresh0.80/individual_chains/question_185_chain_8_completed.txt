Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H equals ε times the dot product of σ and n, right? Oh wait, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. And ε is an energy constant.

So, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product σ·n would then be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. So H is ε multiplied by that sum. 

Wait, eigenvalues of a matrix... right, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the equation H|ψ> = E|ψ>, which leads to the characteristic equation det(H - E I) = 0.

But wait, maybe there's a shortcut here. I recall that for a spin-½ system, the eigenvalues of the spin operator along any direction are ± ħ/2 times something. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Because each Pauli matrix, when multiplied by ħ/2, gives the spin operator. So for example, S·n = (ħ/2) σ·n. So H is ε times σ·n, which is the same as 2S·n times (ε/(2*(ħ/2))) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let me think about the operator σ·n. The eigenvalues of σ·n would be ±1 because, for any unit vector n, σ·n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Oh wait, no, because the trace is zero and the determinant is -1. Oh wait, the determinant of σ·n is the product of eigenvalues. Let me think: σ·n is a 2x2 matrix. Its trace is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector, so each component will contribute. So trace is 0, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant is (n_x)^2 + (n_y)^2 + (n_z)^2 multiplied by something? Wait, no, the determinant of σ·n would be determinant(n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz). I'm not sure about that off the top of my head. Alternatively, I can think about the square of σ·n. (σ·n)^2 would be (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. Expanding that, each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), and the cross terms are σi σj for i≠j, which are anti-commuting. But when you square it, all the cross terms would cancel because n_i n_j (σi σj + σj σi) equals 2n_i n_j I if i=j, but for i≠j, it's zero when summed over all pairs. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, let me calculate (σ·n)^2. It would be (n·σ)^2 = n_x^2 σx² + n_y^2 σy² + n_z^2 σz² + n_x n_y σx σy + n_x n_z σx σz + n_y n_z σy σz + ... but wait, that's too messy. Alternatively, I know that (σ·n)^2 = |n|^2 I? No, wait, n is a unit vector, so |n|=1. So (σ·n)^2 = I? Because σ_i squared is I for each i. So the cross terms would vanish? Hmm, no, because σi and σj anticommute when i≠j. So let me compute (σ·n)^2: each term n_i σi times n_j σj. For i=j, n_i^2 σi² is n_i^2 I. For i≠j, n_i n_j (σi σj + σj σi)/2, but wait, σi and σj anticommute, so σi σj = - σj σi. So σi σj + σj σi = 0. So all the cross terms are zero. Therefore, (σ·n)^2 = (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I. Since n is a unit vector, this is I. So (σ·n)^2 = I. 

So the eigenvalues of σ·n must satisfy (E)^2 = 1, so E is ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ·n are +1 and -1. So if the Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ·n), then the eigenvalues would be ε*(±1), which is ±ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. 

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes people use different conventions. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when they are multiplied by a factor, like ε, the eigenvalues scale accordingly. So if H = ε (σ·n), and each eigenvalue of σ·n is ±1, then H's eigenvalues are ε * (±1) = ±ε. So yes, option B is correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the eigenvalues are ±ε, so option B is the answer.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To find the eigenvalues of \(H\), we analyze the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\).

The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices: \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z\). The eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are known to be \(\pm 1\) because the Pauli matrices satisfy \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This ensures that the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are constrained to \(\pm 1\).

Since the Hamiltonian \(H\) is \(\varepsilon\) times \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) are scaled by \(\varepsilon\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Among the given options:
- Option A (\(\pm 1\)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).
- Option B (\(\pm \varepsilon\)) is correct, as shown above.
- Option C (\(\pm \varepsilon \hbar / 2\)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \(\hbar / 2\).
- Option D (\(\pm \hbar / 2\)) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Answer: B
