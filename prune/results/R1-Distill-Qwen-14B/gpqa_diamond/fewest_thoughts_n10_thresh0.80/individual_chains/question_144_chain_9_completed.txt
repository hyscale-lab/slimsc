Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they're produced, they don't live very long before they decay. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X. 

Alright, let's look at the given data. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, so I need to find the mean decay distance. I think this has something to do with the particle's lifetime and velocity.

I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width by the uncertainty principle. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, wait, no, because the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime as Γ = ħ / τ, so τ would be ħ divided by Γ. Oh right, so τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, actually, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ. That's correct. So the lifetime is given by that. 

But wait, the decay distance is how far the particle travels before decaying, so that's the lifetime multiplied by the speed of the particle. So the mean decay distance L should be L = v * τ. But wait, I'm not sure if I should be considering the velocity. Alternatively, I think the formula involves the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * (ħ / Γ). But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of relativistic velocity. The particle is moving at a certain speed, so to find the distance, I need to find how fast it's going. The energy given is E_X = 8 GeV. The mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So perhaps I can calculate the velocity using the relativistic energy formula.

The relativistic energy formula is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Since E_X is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, what's γ? Let me compute γ = E_X / (m_X c²). Wait, c is the speed of light, and in these units, c² is already accounted for. So E in GeV, m in GeV/c², so E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). But since the units are in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps we can ignore the c² in the calculation because when using E and m in compatible units, the c² factors cancel. Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact unit handling, but maybe I can proceed as follows:

γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ is about 6.6667, which is 20/3. So from that, I can calculate the velocity. The Lorentz factor γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So solving for v: v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let me compute that.

γ is 20/3, so γ squared is (400)/(9), so 1/γ squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately sqrt(0.9775). Let me see, sqrt(0.96) is 0.98, so 0.9775 is a bit higher. Let's calculate: 0.9775^0.5. Hmm, 0.989? Let me think, 0.989^2 is (approx) 0.978, yes. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, so v ≈ c * 0.9887. So the velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light. That's pretty close to c, which makes sense since the energy is much higher than the rest mass.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But wait, what are the units here? ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh right, because ħ in eV·s is about 6.582×10^-16 eV·s. Wait, but since we're dealing with GeV, let me check: 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s → 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So yes, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

The width Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Yeah.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ. But wait, wait, because v is a fraction of c, so L = v * τ = (0.9887 c) * τ. So c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So let's compute this step by step.

First, τ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV → 20.56875e-25 s. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no: 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24? Let me check exponents. 1e-25 is 0.1e-24, so 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24. Yes.

Now, v is 0.9887 c, so L = 0.9887 c * τ. Let's compute that.

c = 3e8 m/s. τ = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute the numbers.

First, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters. Wait, because 3e8 * 2e-24 is 6e-16, so yes, 6.17e-16. Then multiply by 0.9887, which is approximately 1, so 6.17e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.10e-16 meters. Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Actually, 3e8 = 3 * 1e8. 3 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16. Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.107e-16. So approximately 6.107e-16 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 m range. The options are A) 5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, etc. Hmm, my calculation gives around 6e-16, but the options don't have that. So did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of τ. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 → Let's compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 20 gives 6.4. 6.582-6.4=0.182 left. 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875. So total is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. No, wait, 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s, because 20.5e-25 is 2.05e-24.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the decay length as L = (c * τ) * (E/(m c²)) * (1/Γ) ??? No, I think that's not the right way. Alternatively, maybe I should use the relation between decay width and lifetime correctly.

Wait, another thought: the mean decay length is given by L = cτ * β γ, where β is v/c and γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh, because in particle physics, the decay length is often expressed as cτ multiplied by the particle's gamma times beta (γβ). Because the mean proper lifetime is τ, and the lab frame lifetime is γ τ, so the distance is v * γ τ = γ β c τ.

Wait, that's probably where I went wrong. Let me re-express this. The proper lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Then, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ. So the mean decay distance is L = v * (γ τ) ) = (β c) * (γ τ) ) = β γ c τ.

Wait, but v is beta c, so L = v * (gamma tau) ) → yes, that's correct. So L = beta gamma c tau.

But wait, tau is ħ/(Γ) = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute beta gamma. We have gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. Beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2) )^2 )). Wait no, gamma is 8/1.2, which is 6.6667.

Wait, gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (20/3)^2 )) ) → (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/44.4444≈0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, as before. So beta is about 0.9887.

So beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

So L = beta gamma c tau = 6.591 * c * tau.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s. Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So let's compute c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → 6.170625e-16 meters.

Multiply by beta gamma, which is approx 6.591 → 6.170625e-16 m * 6.591 ≈ 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, 6.170625 * 6.591 is approximately 40.65? Let me compute that: 6 * 6.591 is about 39.546, and 0.170625 *6.591≈1.123. So total about 40.67, so 40.67e-16 m =4.067e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m and option C is 5.0223e-15 m. So 4.067e-15 is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the calculation steps.

Wait, where did I get beta gamma from? Because L = v * (gamma tau) ) → v is beta c, and gamma tau is the lab frame lifetime. So yes, v * gamma tau = beta c * gamma tau. So L = beta gamma c tau.

So let me recalculate beta gamma:

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666667.

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(44.4444)) )= sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So beta * gamma ≈6.666667 * 0.9887 ≈6.591.

So c tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s → 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591 → 6.170625e-16 *6.591 ≈4.065e-15 m.

Yes, that looks correct. So the answer is option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but what about the other approach? What if I didn't consider the gamma factor correctly? Let me think again.

Alternatively, the mean lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma. The velocity is v = beta c. Then, the distance is v * tau = beta c * (hbar / Gamma). But wait, that's not considering the gamma factor. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than tau by a factor of gamma. So the proper lifetime is tau, but the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the correct decay length is v * gamma tau.

Wait, so the decay length is L = beta c * gamma tau = beta gamma c tau.

Yes, that's correct. So my calculation earlier is correct.

Another point to check: units. Gamma is in GeV, and hbar is in GeV·s. So when I compute hbar / Gamma, the GeV cancels, leaving seconds, which is correct for tau.

So I think I've got it right. The answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship between the decay width \( \Gamma \), the mean lifetime \( \tau \), and the relativistic velocity of the particle. The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) is the reduced Planck's constant.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy of the meson is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

The decay width is \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (0.9887)(6.6667)(3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8)(2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Then, multiply by \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
L = (0.9887)(6.6667)(6.170625 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
