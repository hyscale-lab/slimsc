Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem about Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question has three parts (A, B, C), each involving different reactants and conditions. I'll need to tackle each one separately and then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile here is the enolate ion.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a stable enolate. When the enolate attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, it forms a new carbon-carbon bond. In this case, the acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that would be a methyl ester with an E double bond between carbons 3 and 4, where the 3-carbon is attached to a p-tolyl group.

So, when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position (which is the 3-position of the acrylate), the malonate's enolate would add to the acrylate. The product should be a new compound where the malonate has added across the double bond, and the ester groups are attached.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups (OEt). After the Michael addition, the product would have the two ester groups from the malonate plus the ester from the acrylate. So the structure would connect the two: the malonate's CH2-CO-OEt groups would add to the acrylate's structure. Let me try to draw this mentally.

E-acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OMe. Wait, no, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CC(O)Me-p-tolyl? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-p-tolyl, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2CH(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but wait, no. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, I think it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the 3-position substituted by p-tolyl? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-p-tolyl methyl ester. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2
