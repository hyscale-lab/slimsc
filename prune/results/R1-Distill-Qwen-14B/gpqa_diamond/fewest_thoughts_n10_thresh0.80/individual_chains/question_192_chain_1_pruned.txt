Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, so there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and it's smaller than R, which makes sense because it's inside. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So the setup is a bit tricky. Let me visualize this. There's a conductor, so any excess charge would be on the outer surface if it's charged, but in this case, it's initially uncharged. Then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. Wait, because the conductor is uncharged, when we put a charge inside, how does that affect things?

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to it. So the inner surface of the conductor will have -q, and the outer surface will have some charge. But since the conductor itself is initially uncharged, the outer surface must have no net charge. Because the total charge of the conductor would be the sum of the inner and outer charges. Since it's uncharged, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q, but wait, that would make the total charge zero. Wait, no: the conductor is neutral, so when we add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q. But then the outer surface would have +q, because the conductor as a whole is neutral. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, inner has -q, so outer must have +q. That way, the conductor's total charge is zero.

So the outer surface has +q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when calculating the electric field at P, I can treat the conductor's charge as if it's all located at the center because the outer shell is a conductor, so any excess charge resides on the outer surface, and for points outside, the field is as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. But wait, in this case, the charge on the outer surface is +q. So the electric field at point P would be due to this +q charge.

But wait, let me think again. The conductor is neutral, but when you have a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface gets induced -q, and the outer surface +q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero because inner (-q) + outer (+q) = 0.

So for external points (like point P), the electric field is only due to the outer charge. Because the electric field inside a conductor is zero, so the charges rearrange to shield the interior. So the outer surface's charge behaves as if it's a point charge at the center when considering points outside.

So the electric field at P would be the same as if all the +q were at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center is L. Wait, no—well, no. Because the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the charge distribution on the outer surface is symmetrical around the conductor's center. So yes, the electric field at P should be calculated as if the charge is at the center.

So the electric field E is given by Coulomb's Law: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the distance from the center, and the charge is effectively at the center.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says exactly that. E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But wait, I need to check if I'm missing something else. Because the charge is placed inside the cavity, which is offset from the center. So the arrangement is that the conductor's center and the cavity's center are separated by s. But for points outside the conductor, does the position of the cavity's center matter?

Wait, the outer surface's charge distribution is only affected by the charge inside the cavity, not by where the cavity is located. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface's induced charge is +q, and it's distributed in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. But when looking from outside, the field depends only on the total charge outside, which is +q at the center.

Wait, but point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's charge is the outer +q, which is effectively at the center. So the distance from P to the center is L, so the field is E =
