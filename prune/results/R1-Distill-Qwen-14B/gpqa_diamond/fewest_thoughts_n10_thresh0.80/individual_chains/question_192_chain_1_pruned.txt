Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

Alright, so the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, and the center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The answer choices are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Hmm, so I need to find E at point P. Let me think about how electric fields work in such configurations.

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we place +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must get an induced charge. Oh right, the inner surface of the cavity will have an induced charge of -q because the conductor's material must cancel the electric field within the conductor itself.

Wait, but the conductor itself is neutral. So the outer surface must then have a charge of +q, because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor's total charge is zero. So the outer surface must have +q.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface is what contributes to the electric field outside the conductor. So the E field at point P, which is outside, should be the same as if all the charge on the conductor were concentrated at its center. So according to Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the total enclosed charge is +q, so the E at point P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²), because point P is outside. So that's similar to what a point charge would produce.

Wait, but wait. The cavity is offset from the center. So the charge +q inside the cavity is not at the center. So does that affect the electric field outside?

Wait no, because the conductor's charges rearrange such that the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric. Because the conductor is spherical, the outer surface's charge distribution will depend on the symmetry. But in this case, the cavity is off-center. So the induced charges on the inner surface would be such that the electric field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) is zero. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges move to make the E field zero in its material.

So let me think: the inner surface of the cavity has induced -q charge. The outer surface has +q. Now, the conductor as a whole is neutral, so the sum is zero: inner has -q, outer has +q, total is zero.

But the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field only depends on the outer charge, which is +q. And since the conductor is spherical, the outer charge's distribution is spherically symmetric, regardless of where the charge inside the
