Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which I think is about 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. So B is probably a solid that melts just above freezing. Hmm, maybe something like ice? Or maybe another solid like a salt.

Wait, no, B's melting point is 277 K, which is about 4°C. That makes me think of something like water ice melting at 0°C, but wait, 277 is 4°C. Alternatively, maybe something else. Let me think... substances that melt near there. Maybe something else? Or perhaps B is something like a crystal that has a slightly higher melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid with a melting point just above room temperature.

But let's not get stuck here. Let's move on. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So, the gas is likely to be something like NH3? Wait, no. Let me think about the structure of W. Each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the total number of neutrons in the molecule is equal to the number of protons.

Wait, maybe it's CO2? No, because CO2 has a molecule with C (6 protons) and two O (8 each). But the molecule's total protons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons? Let's see, carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, oxygen-16 has 8. So each molecule would have 6 + 8 +8 = 22 neutrons. Oh wait, protons would be 6 + 8 +8 = 22, so yes, 22 each. So CO2 would fit. Or wait, maybe another gas.

Alternatively, maybe W is CH4. Let's see: CH4 has C (6 protons) and 4 H (1 each). So total protons:6+4=10. Neutrons: Carbon-12 has 6, each H has 0. So each molecule would have 6 neutrons. 6 ≠10, so that's not it.

Wait another possibility: H2O? Each molecule has 2 H (protons 1 each, so 2) and O (8). So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: O has 8 (assuming oxygen-16), H has 0. So each H2O molecule has 8 neutrons. 8≠10, so no.

Wait, maybe NH3? NH3 has N (7 protons) and 3 H (1 each). So total protons:7+3=10. Neutrons: N-14 has 7 neutrons (since 14-7=7). So each NH3 would have 7 neutrons. 7≠10. Not matching.

Hmm, maybe CO? CO molecule: C (6 protons) and O (8), so 14 protons. Neutrons: C-12 (6) and O-16 (8) → 6 +8 =14. Oh, so each CO molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that fits the condition. So W could be CO.

So the gas is carbon monoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's something else. Let me think. Are there other molecules where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the entire molecule?

Wait, let's think of another possibility. Maybe N2? Each molecule has 14 protons (2 atoms of N, each with 7), and each N has 7 neutrons (assuming N-14). So each N2 molecule would have 14 protons and
