Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, okay, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. Wait, but I think the formation of the complex involves the reaction between Ca²+ ions and EDTA^4- ions. The reaction is something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. 

The formation constant K for this reaction is given by K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So K is a very large number (5e10), which means the complex is very stable, so the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA are very low.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²-], which is 0.02 M.

Wait, but in solution, the complex dissociates a bit. So [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] would be very small, but their product is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-} = [CaEDTA²-}/K.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is K = [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So if I rearrange that, [metal][ligand] = [complex]/K.

But wait, in this case, the complex is CaEDTA²- which forms from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [complex] is 0.02.

So [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13. 

But wait, I'm trying to find the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²+]. How can I find that?

Hmm, maybe I should consider that EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. But the problem states the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, EDTA^4-. Because if the pH is high enough, all the protons are removed, so EDTA is present as EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think. EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and it has multiple protons. At a certain pH, it's deprotonated to form the EDTA^4- ion. Since the problem says the pH is ideal, perhaps it's at a pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the ligand concentration is just [EDTA^4-].

But wait, the formation constant K is given for the reaction as written. So if the pH is such that EDTA is present as EDTA^4-, then [EDTA] is just EDTA^4- concentration. But if the pH is lower, then some of EDTA would be protonated, so the effective [EDTA^4-] would be less. However, the problem says pH is ideal, so let's assume that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the [EDTA] is [EDTA^4-].

Wait, but wait, another thing. Since the complex is in solution, the EDTA is mostly tied up in the complex. The free EDTA would be very low because K is large. So the dissociation would be minimal. So, the concentration [EDTA^4-] would be very small.

Wait, but in this case, the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA²-. So, when it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But the extent of dissociation is small because K is large, so the dissociation is minimal.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the formation constant K is large, which implies that the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So, the concentrations of the free ions (Ca²+ and EDTA^4-) are very low.

So, given that [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M, and K is 5e10, we can find [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13.

But wait, the problem is to find [Ca²+], but how? Because we have [Ca²+] multiplied by [EDTA^4-] equals 4e-13. I need another equation to relate [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-].

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the total concentration of EDTA comes from the complex and the free EDTA. But wait, the initial EDTA added would be part of the complex. Suppose the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt. So the total EDTA would be 0.02 M. But wait, more accurately, the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, which would dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption is that all EDTA is in the complex, but that's not the case because some would dissociate. Hmm, but the K is so large that the dissociation is minimal. So, the amount of free Ca²+ and free EDTA would be negligible compared to the complex.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA²-} = 0.02. Then, the dissociation would give [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-} such that their product is 4e-13.

But without more information, like the concentration of EDTA added, I don't think I can proceed. Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that all the EDTA is in the complex. But that doesn't make sense because the K is so large that [Ca²+] is very low.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex dissociates as: CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = 5e10.

So, [Ca²+][EDTA^4-} = [CaEDTA²-} / K = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13.

But I'm supposed to find [Ca²+]. Without knowing [EDTA^4-}, I can't directly find [Ca²+}.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the concentration of EDTA is much higher than the calcium, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in the complex, the EDTA is in excess, so that the concentration of EDTA is much higher than calcium. But in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, which is the only source of EDTA and Ca²+.

Wait, that can't be right because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, perhaps the total concentration of EDTA is 0.02 M, because each complex releases one EDTA. So, the total EDTA would be [EDTA^4-} + [CaEDTA²-} ] ≈ 0.02, assuming that the free [EDTA^4-} is negligible because K is so large.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think: If the complex is 0.02 M, and the K is 5e10, then the product [Ca²+][EDTA^4-} is 4e-13. But if the initial EDTA is 0.02 M (only the complex), then the free EDTA [EDTA^4-} is approximately equal to [Ca²+} because the reaction is:

CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the dissociation would produce x concentration of Ca²+ and x concentration of EDTA^4-.

So, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-} = x. Then, the product is x^2 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Hmm, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and 10^-13's square root is 10^-6.5. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

Wait, but that would make [Ca²+] approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because if the complex is 0.02 M and the dissociation is x, then:

[CaEDTA²-} ] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is tiny).

So, the formation constant is K = (0.02)/(x * x) ) = 0.02 / x^2 = 5e10.

So, solving for x: x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13 => x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approx 6.32e-7.

So, [Ca²+] = x = 6.32e-7 M, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²+]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex at an ideal pH and 25°C, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction for the formation of the complex is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is defined as:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), we calculate:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

At an ideal pH, EDTA is fully deprotonated to \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), so the dissociation of the complex produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). Let \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches option C.
