Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. 

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, I guess, because shorter orbital period means it's nearer. Oh wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So if Planet_1's period is three times shorter, the semi-major axis would be smaller by the cube root of (1/9), roughly. So about 1/2.08 times the period, but I'm not sure if that matters right now.

Both host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but they have the same size. Wait, so the stars have the same radius. That's important because the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the probability is about the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. 

The transit probability formula I recall is P â‰ˆ (R_*/a) * (some factor), but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively,
