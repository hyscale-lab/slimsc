Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting.

From what I remember, the transit method involves detecting planets when they pass in front of their host star from our point of view. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, since both planets have Earth-like masses, but their host stars might have different radii, that could affect the transit probability.

Wait, the question says both host stars have the same radii. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius. So that cancels out the star size in the probability. Hmm.

I recall that the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)² * (a_s / a_p), where R_p is the planet radius, R_s the star radius, a_s the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter (but wait, no, I might be mixing some terms). Wait, no, the probability is more about the orientation. The probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's size.

Wait, no, perhaps the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Wait, I think the probability is actually (R_star / a) times (something else). Let me clarify.

The transit probability for a planet is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_s)^(1/3))) )^2, but wait, maybe that's more about the Doppler method. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula for the transit probability. From what I remember, the probability that a planet transits its host star (from our line of sight) is roughly (R_s + R_p) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/
