Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids due to a disproportionation reaction. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. Importantly, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

First, let's try to figure out what substances are involved here. Since X is a mixture that decolorizes bromine water, which typically reacts with alkenes or alkynes. But since X is a mixture of two liquids, perhaps it's a mixture of alkenes or maybe an alkene and an alkyne? But wait, the mixture Y comes from a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation usually involves a species being both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing, oxygen is both oxidized and reduced.

Wait, but the starting point is a mixture X that decolorizes bromine. So X has unsaturated bonds, so likely alkenes or alkynes. But since they are liquids, their molecular weights are probably lower. For example, ethylene is a gas, but something like 1,3-butadiene is a liquid? Hmm, not sure. Maybe the alkenes are dienes or something else.

The reaction of X with platinum and heat leads to Y. The reaction is a disproportionation. So perhaps, the starting material is a single compound that can disproportionate into two different compounds. But wait, the question says X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So maybe X consists of two different alkenes or alkynes that when heated with Pt undergo some reaction.

Wait, but the product Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. But the key is that Y's mixture doesn't decolorize bromine. So the products Y must not have any double or triple bonds that react with bromine. So, perhaps Y's components are more saturated or maybe have single bonds only.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. So, when X and Y are hydrogenated, the only product is Z. That suggests that hydrogenation of X's components leads to Z, and same with Y. So, probably, X consists of two alkenes that upon hydrogenation give Z, and Y consists of two alkanes that hydrogenate to the same Z. Because if Y's mixture doesn't react with bromine, they must be single bonds, so alkanes or maybe something else.

Wait, but if Y is alkanes, then hydrogenation would not change them. Because alkanes don't react under normal hydrogenation conditions. So that suggests that Y might not be alkanes. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon heating with Pt, undergoes a reaction to form two different alkanes in Y. But that doesn't make sense because alkanes don't decolorize bromine.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible structure of Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's compute that.

Mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, if the molar mass is M, then (M_H / M) = 14.28%. So, 14.28% is 0.1428.

Hydrogen has an atomic weight of about 1.008 g/mol. Let's assume Z is a hydrocarbon of formula CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m * 1.008) / (12n + m * 1.008) = 0.1428.

Let me compute that. Let's set it up as:

(m * 1.008) / (12n + m * 1.008) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m * 1.008 = 0.1428 * (12n + m * 1.008)

Expand RHS:

0.1428 *12n + 0.1428 * m *1.008

= 1.7136n + 0.1439m

So equation:

1.008 m = 1.7136 n + 0.1439 m

Bring all terms to left:

1.008 m - 0.1439 m -1.7136 n =0

(1.008 - 0.1439) m = 1.7136 n

0.8641 m = 1.7136 n

Simplify dividing both sides by 0.8641:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8641) n

Let me compute 1.7136 / 0.8641.

Approximately, 1.7136 / 0.8641 ≈ 1.982, which is about 2.

So m ≈ 2n.

So the formula is approximately CnH2n.

Wait, CnH2n is the formula for an alkene. But wait, if Z is a hydrocarbon obtained by hydrogenation, then perhaps it's an alkane. Because hydrogenation would add hydrogen across double bonds.

Wait, but Z is the product of hydrogenation of both X and Y
