Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, pseudosphere... right, a pseudosphere is a surface in geometry, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics here. I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere can be a solution to the Einstein field equations, like the Schwarzschild solution, but that's for a black hole. Wait, no, Schwarzschild is a sphere, maybe this is something else.

So, the metric looks a bit like a 2D metric because it's in terms of dx² and dy². Wait, but the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, right, so in polar coordinates, if x² + y² = r², then the denominator becomes 4 - r². But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, radius 2... so 4 is (2)^2 times 2? No, wait, 4 is 2 squared. So when r is 2, the denominator becomes 4 - 4 = 0. Oh, that's interesting. So the metric becomes singular at r=2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So maybe r=2 is a boundary here.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the metric
