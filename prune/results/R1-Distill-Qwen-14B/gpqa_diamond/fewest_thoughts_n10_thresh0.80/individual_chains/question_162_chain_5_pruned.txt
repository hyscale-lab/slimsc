Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on the signature and the form.

Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like a saddle shape. So maybe this metric is describing such a space. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Let me break down the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That makes me think about the equation x² + y² = something. If the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), then for real values, the denominator must be positive, so x² + y² < 4. So the space is defined only where x and y are such that x² + y² is less than 4. That's a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Interesting.

The metric is multiplied by (dx² + dy²), which is the standard Euclidean metric. But scaled by this factor. So it's like a conformal metric, meaning it's a scaling of flat space. Conformal metrics are easier to handle because you can separate variables.

Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, no, the question says the pseudosphere of radius r=2.
