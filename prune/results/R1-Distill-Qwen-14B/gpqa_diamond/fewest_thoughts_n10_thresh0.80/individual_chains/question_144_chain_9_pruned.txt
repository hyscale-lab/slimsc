Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are particles, usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are unstable particles, right? So they decay quickly.

The problem gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, each with a different value in meters.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance has something to do with how far the meson travels before decaying. The formula I'm trying to recall is the mean decay length, which is the product of the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, so L = γ * c * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime, and γ is the Lorentz factor.

But first, I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I remember that Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me get the numbers right.

Let me jot down the constants. Planck's constant h is about 6.62607015e-34 J·s. So ħ would be h/(2π), which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Oh wait, but I need to work in units that match the given values. The width Γ is given in MeV, and the mass is in GeV. So I should make sure all units are consistent.

Wait, the energy here is in GeV, and the width is 320 MeV. Let me convert everything to GeV to make it easier. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, units are tricky here. Γ has units of GeV, which is energy. ħ has units of J·s, but J is kg·m²/s². So how to convert GeV into kg·m²/s²?

I think I can use the conversion factor between GeV and kg. 1 GeV is approximately 1.7827e-27 kg. So 1 GeV⁻¹ would be (1.7827e-27 kg)⁻¹, but wait, no, since ħ has units of J·s, which is (kg·m²/s²)·s) = kg·m²/s.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express ħ in units of GeV·s. Let me calculate that. Since 1 GeV is 1.60218e-10 J (because 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J, so 1 GeV is 1e9 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 1.60218e-10 J). So ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert this into GeV·s, I divide by 1.60218e-10 J/GeV.

So ħ in GeV·s is 1.0545718e-34 / 1.60218e-10 ≈ approx 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that seems really short, but considering it's a resonance, that's expected.

Now, next part: the velocity. I think the velocity of the meson depends on its energy. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV/c². So I can find the velocity using relativistic energy equations.

In special relativity, the energy E is related to the rest mass
