Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I need to remember what regularization means in physics. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which are unphysical. So, to make sense of these infinities, physicists use regularization methods to make the calculations finite and then remove the regularization (renormalize) to get meaningful results.

Wait, but the question is which theory never needs this regularization. That implies that for that theory, there are no divergences that require such techniques, at least at high energies.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. One of its features is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences that other quantum field theories do because the fundamental objects are strings, not point particles. So maybe in string theory, these divergences are somehow tamed without needing regularization. But wait, isn't string theory still a quantum theory? I think it does require some form of regularization or maybe it's already free from such issues due to its structure. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll note that as a possibility.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, making perturbative methods workable. But wait, even so, when you do calculations in QCD, especially at lower energies, you might get divergences. So I think QCD does require regularization, perhaps using methods like lattice QCD or other techniques. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember learning that QED does have divergences, especially in loop calculations. For example, the electron self-energy has divergences, which are handled through renormalization. So QED definitely requires regularization methods, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization.
