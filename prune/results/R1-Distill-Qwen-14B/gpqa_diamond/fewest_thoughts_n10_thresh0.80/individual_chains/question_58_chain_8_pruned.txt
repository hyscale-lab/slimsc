Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about physical theories and which one never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? So when calculations give infinite results, regularization helps to make those finite.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics. I need to think about each of these theories and whether they require regularization.

Starting with option C, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I remember that QED is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. It's a well-established theory, but I think it does have issues with divergences, like the electron self-energy problems. So they must use regularization techniques, like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization, to handle those infinities. So QED does require regularization, so option C is out.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. I remember that QCD also has issues with things like the running of coupling constants and things like confinement. But as a quantum field theory, it must have similar problems with divergences, so it probably requires regularization as well. So B might require regularization, so it's not the answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Wait, superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. String theories are different from quantum field theories because they don't have point particles; instead, they're based on strings. I think string theories aim to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences that QED or QCD have. But I'm not entirely sure. Because in string theory, the interactions are different. They calculate using things like the sum over topologies (like worldsheets) and perhaps don't have the same loop divergences as in QFT. So maybe superstring theory doesn't need regularization. But I'm a bit fuzzy on thatâ€”I should think more.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics, so they don't have the same kinds of infinities. For example, in classical electromagnetism,
