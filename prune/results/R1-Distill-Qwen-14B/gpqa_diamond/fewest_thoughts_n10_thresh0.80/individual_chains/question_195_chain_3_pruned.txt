Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and take notes.

The question says that there are two planets being observed. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii and is also in a circular orbit with the same orbital plane as the first. The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur.

Hmm, transits and occultations. So, transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, making it less bright because we can't see the planet's reflected light. For both events to happen, the planet's orbit must be aligned so that its path takes it in front and behind the star relative to us. But how does that affect the orbital period?

Wait, but the problem says the second planet shares the same orbital plane as the first. So the orbital inclinations are the same. That probably means their orbits are in the same plane, so both transit and occultation could occur if their orbital periods are such that they are in the right positions relative to each other and the star.

But what's the main factor here? Oh, I think it's about the orbital periods and the size of the star relative to the planets' orbits. Because for a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star, which depends on the alignment of the orbits. But for occultation, the planet has to pass behind the star. So they both need to be in the correct positions.

Wait, but the orbital period of the second planet is what's in question. So the first planet has a 3-day period, and we need to find the maximum period for the second so that both events occur.

Wait, I remember that for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. So the first planet's transit tells us that its orbital inclination is such that it transits. The second planet is in the same orbital plane, so it's also at the same inclination. So both will transit? Or does it depend on their orbital periods?

Wait, no. The transit of the first planet just tells us that the system is edge-on. So the second planet, being in the same plane, will also transit if its orbital period is such that it can be in the right position. But the question is about the maximum period of the second planet that allows both transit and occultation.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The key is that the second planet must have a period such that the planet can be both in front and behind the star from our perspective. But how does that relate to the orbital periods?

Oh, right, it's about the synodic period. Because for both events to occur, the two planets must sometimes be aligned in a way that the second is in front and sometimes behind. So the maximum period would relate to the time it takes for the second planet to lap the first, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question
