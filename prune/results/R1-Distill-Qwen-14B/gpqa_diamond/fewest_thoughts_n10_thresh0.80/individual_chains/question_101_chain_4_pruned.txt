Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction using 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what compound A is and which catalyst (B) was used.

Hmm, I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions often involve things like aldehyde groups or maybe some kind of addition or condensation reactions. Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. That sounds like a cyclohexyl group attached to a methylene (CH₂) group, right? So maybe it's an addition of a cyclohexylidene group.

So, looking at the starting material, 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring. The 3-methyl means there's a methyl group on the third carbon. The product has a substituent added to the 1-position, which is the position adjacent to the nitrogen.

I think this might be a type of alkylation or maybe an enamine formation. Wait, wait, another possibility is a Wittig reaction. Because the product has a new double bond formed. Let me think about that. The Wittig reaction typically forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with a Wittig reagent (like an ylide).

Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed aldol addition? Or some kind of condensation reaction. Wait, but the question mentions acid catalyst, so maybe it's a variation of that.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidene group attached. So the cyclohexylidene group is like a cyclohexene ring attached via a double bond. Hmm, does that suggest that a cyclohexylidene group was added to the pyrrolidine ring?

Wait, another approach: let's think about the structure of the product. 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine would mean that the pyrrolidine (five-membered ring) has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methylene group (CH₂) connected to a cyclohexylidene group. Wait, cyclohexyl
