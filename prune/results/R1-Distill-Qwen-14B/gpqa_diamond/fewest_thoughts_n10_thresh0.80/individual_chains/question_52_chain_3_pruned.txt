Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

So, the problem is about the ratio of populations in two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in the stellar photosphere. The key here is probably the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states of atoms to temperature and density. But wait, in this case, it's about two different energy levels, not ionization. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's the Boltzmann equation we need here instead.

Right, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities of the two states, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Oh wait, but what's the exact scenario here? The ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So the factor by which the ratio changes is the ratio when no spots are present divided by the ratio when spots are present.

So, let's denote the ratio as R = n1/n2. When there are no spots, R0 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ), where T1 is 6000 K. When there are spots, the effective temperature drops to T2=5500 K. Wait, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. But wait, does
