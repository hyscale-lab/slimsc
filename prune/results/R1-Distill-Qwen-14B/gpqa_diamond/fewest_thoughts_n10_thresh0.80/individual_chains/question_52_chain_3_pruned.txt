Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the population of these energy levels in the stellar photosphere. Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The ratio N2/N1 is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, no, actually, the equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Since E2 > E1 (because level 2 is higher in energy), the exponential term will be less than 1, so higher temperature would increase the ratio N2/N1 because the exponential factor becomes larger. Or wait, no, wait. If T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, making the exponential larger. So when temperature is higher, the ratio N2/N1 increases.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. So when the star has spots, T_eff goes down from 6000 K to 5500 K. The question says that the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases when the star has spots. Wait, which ratio are they talking about? The ratio is level 1 to level 2, or level 2 to level 1?

Wait, the problem states: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". It doesn't specify which way, but when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. Let's assume that the ratio is N1/N2. So when the star has spots, N1/N2 decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So N1/N2 would be the inverse of that: (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when temperature decreases, (E2-E1)/(k
