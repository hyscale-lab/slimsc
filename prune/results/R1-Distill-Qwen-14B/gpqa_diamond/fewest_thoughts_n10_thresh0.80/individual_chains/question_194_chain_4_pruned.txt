Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, right. So I need to find all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate the energy for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all of them.

First, each spin has two possible states, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total. Let me list them all. Let's denote each state as (S1, S2, S3).

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I'll calculate the energy E.

Energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term step by step.

Starting with state 1: all +1.

S1S2 = 1*1 =1, same for S1S3 and S2S3. So sum is 3. E = -J *3. So E = -3J.

Then, the Boltzmann factor is exp(β*(-3J)) = e^(-3Jβ).

State 2: (+1, +1, -1).

S1S2 =1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. Boltzmann factor e^(Jβ).

Wait, wait. Wait, the energy is E = -J (sum). So sum for state 2: (1*1)+(1*-1)+(1*-1) = 1-1-1= -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J. So factor is e^{-β E} = e^{-β J} ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Because exp(-β E) is part of the partition function. So the Boltzmann factor is e^(-β E). So if E is J, it's e^(-β J *1), since E=J.

Wait, no. Let me think again. E is given as E = -J (sum of products). So for each state, E is calculated as that.

So for state 2:

Sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 =
