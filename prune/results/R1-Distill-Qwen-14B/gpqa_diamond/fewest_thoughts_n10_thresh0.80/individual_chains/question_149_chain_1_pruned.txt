Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected, except for two peaks that are both from the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're coupling with each other or another proton. Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. Hmm.

Wait, so what's going on here? Let me think about possible issues in a synthesized compound. The fact that the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton suggests something is causing these peaks to split. But since coupling is ruled out, maybe it's not about neighboring protons. Another possibility is that the molecule isn't pure. But how would impurity show up in the NMR and LC-MS?

The LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. That's confusing because if they have the same mass, they're the same molecule, right? Unless... Oh wait, maybe it's a diastereomer or enantiomer. Because diastereomers have different physical properties, but enantiomers have the same mass and same retention times on some columns. Wait, no, LC-MS would separate them if there's a chiral column, but if they used a regular column, enantiomers might co-elute. But the question mentions elevated temperatureâ€”maybe it's affecting the separation?

But wait, the NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton. If the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, would that cause each alpha-proton to split into two? Because in a racemic mixture, each enantiomer's protons would be in a different environment relative to the other. But wait, in the NMR, if you have a mixture, the peaks could broaden or split. But if the two enantiomers are present, and the alpha-proton environment is symmetric in each, maybe you wouldn't see two peaks. Or maybe you would? Hmm, I'm not so sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound has formed some sort of dimer or is undergoing some kind of association. But then the NMR would show different shifts because of the environment changes, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. So the LC-MS would show the precursor as another peak. But the question states that both peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule. So the precursor would have a different mass, probably higher if it's a peptide. So this might not fit.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Then in LC-MS, if it's a normal column (non-chiral), both would elute at the same time, giving a single peak. But if the column is chiral, then they would separate. The question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. Oh but wait, if it's a racemic mixture, in a chiral column, they would elute separately, giving two peaks of equal area, same mass. So this could fit. But then in NMR, a racemic mixture would average the signals, right? Because the two enantiomers would have mirror-image environments. So for a single proton that's in a symmetric position, maybe the signals would overlap. But in this case, the two peaks for the same alpha-proton are in the same NMR spectrum. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Because if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak, as the two enantiomers contribute identical signals. So this might not explain the NMR observation. Wait, but maybe in some cases, like if the proton is in a chiral environment and the two enantiomers cause different shifts? No, that doesn't make sense because the shifts would be the same. So perhaps option B is not the right answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe during the formation of the amide, some coupling occurred where two protons are involved? Or perhaps some diastereotopic protons are present. Wait, diastereotopic protons are two protons that are not equivalent due to the asymmetry of the molecule. In such cases, they can have different chemical shifts. But in this case, the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the amide formation led to some kind of coupling that creates two signals. Not sure about this option. I might have to think more.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR signals would be different. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would give a different shift for each proton. But if the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, each with a set of protons, the NMR would show the sum of all the signals. Wait, but in this question, two peaks for the same proton exist. So if the two diastereomers have the same alpha-proton environment, their shifts would be the same, but if the environment is different, their shifts would split. However, in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts, implying the environments are very similar. Maybe they're diastereomers where the alpha-proton is in a similar environment. But then, in the LC-MS, they would have different retention times because diastereomers have different physical properties. Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. That doesn't make sense for diastereomers because they'd have different molecular weights? No, wait, diastereomers have the same molecular weight. Oh right, same molecular formula. So their mass would be the same, which fits the LC-MS data. So if it's a mixture of two diastereomers with same molecular weight, they would appear as two separate peaks if the column can separate them.

But then why are their shifts similar in NMR? Because the alpha-proton is in a slightly different environment. So the two diastereomers have different configurations which cause the alpha-proton to have two shifts, close to each other. But wait, the integrals add up to 1H. So the two signals each have about 0.5H, making 1H in total. That could happen if each diastereomer contributes 0.5H to that peak. Hmm, but each molecule would have one alpha-proton. So if the mixture is
