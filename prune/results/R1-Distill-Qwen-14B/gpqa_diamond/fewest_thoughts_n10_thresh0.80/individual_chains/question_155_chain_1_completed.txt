Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

First, let me parse the problem. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each with their matrix forms. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ (hbar). The state vector is given as a column with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think implies that the eigenstates of P_z are the basis for this vector space.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, for ΔP_z, the formula would be sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, in this case, the state is an eigenstate of P_x. Since P_x and P_z don't commute (they're different components of angular momentum or something similar), the uncertainty principle would come into play. But I'm not sure if that affects how I calculate ΔP_z directly. Maybe I should just proceed with calculating the expectation values.

So the plan is to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state ψ, then plug into the uncertainty formula.

Let me write down the given state vector. It's a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Wait, but the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Let me think about how the matrix P_z is set up. The matrix P_z is diagonal because its basis is the eigenstates of P_z.

Looking at the matrix form of P_z:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0,0,-ħ]

So, the eigenvalues for P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors, so each component in ψ corresponds to these eigenstates. So, the first component of ψ is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ, the second for 0, and the third for -ħ.

So the state ψ is a linear combination of these eigenstates:

ψ = (-1/2) |ħ⟩ + (1/√2) |0⟩ + (-1/2) |-ħ⟩

Wait, but how do I compute the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩?

The expectation value is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Each component in ψ is multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue, then multiplied by the amplitude squared, right? Or wait, no. Actually, since in the basis of P_z, the eigenvalues are along the diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of each component squared multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, to clarify: when you have a state expressed as a vector in the eigenbasis of an operator (here, P_z), the expectation value of that operator is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalue.

So let me compute each term.

The first component of ψ is -1/2. The square of the absolute value is ( (-1/2) )² = 1/4. Multiply by the eigenvalue ħ: (1/4) * ħ.

Second component is 1/√2. Square is 1/2. Multiply by 0: 1/2 * 0 = 0.

Third component is -1/2. Square is 1/4. Multiply by -ħ: 1/4 * (-ħ) = -ħ/4.

So summing these: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩, since P_z squared will have eigenvalues squared. So the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So their squares are ħ², 0, and ħ².

Again, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by eigenvalue squared.

So each term:

First component: (1/4) * (ħ²) = ħ²/4.

Second component: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third component: (1/4) * (ħ²) = ħ²/4.

Sum: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, this simplifies to sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the steps.

The state ψ is given as [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. So |a₁|² is (1/2)^2? Wait no, each component is squared, regardless of sign.

Wait, the components are: a1 = -1/2 → |a1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, a3 is -1/2, same |a3|² = 1/4. a2 is 1/√2 → |a2|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Yes, that's correct.

So for ⟨P_z⟩: 1/4 * ħ + 1/2 * 0 + 1/4 * (-ħ) → ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0.

For ⟨P_z²⟩: 1/4 * ħ² + 1/2 * 0 + 1/4 * ħ² → ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2. So sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2). So option B.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal elements of the $P_z$ matrix. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ is the square of the absolute value of the $i$-th component of $\psi$, and $\lambda_i$ is the corresponding eigenvalue of $P_z$.

- First component: $|-\frac{1}{2}|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_1 = \hbar$, contribution: $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- Second component: $|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, $\lambda_2 = 0$, contribution: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$.
- Third component: $|-\frac{1}{2}|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$, contribution: $\frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Summing these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, i.e., $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2.
\]

- First component: $|-\frac{1}{2}|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2$, contribution: $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- Second component: $|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, $\lambda_2^2 = 0$, contribution: $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$.
- Third component: $|-\frac{1}{2}|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, $\lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2$, contribution: $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Summing these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
