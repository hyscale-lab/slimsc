Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor will induce charges on its surface. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can leave the sphere, right? Oh wait, no. Wait, when a conductor is grounded, it's connected to the Earth, which is a large reservoir of charges. So any induced charges on the conductor can flow in or out until the conductor's potential is the same as the Earth's, which is zero. But wait, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute on its surface.

But wait, when you have a charge outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. For a conducting sphere, the induced charges will be such that the external charge induces an opposite charge on the near side and a same charge on the far side. But wait, no, actually, for a conducting sphere, the internal cavity isn't involved here—so the sphere is solid conductor.

Wait, no, wait, if the sphere is grounded, then any induced charge on the sphere would adjust until the sphere's potential is zero. Because being grounded means it can lose or gain electrons to reach the Earth's potential, which is zero. So the presence of charge q will cause a redistribution of charges on the sphere.

But how does this affect the potential energy?

Hmm. The potential energy of the system would be the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere, considering the potential due to the sphere as well as the charge itself.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded. So the potential of the sphere is zero. How does that affect the potential experienced by the charge q?

Alternatively, when you bring a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere has induced charges, but because it's grounded, the total charge on the sphere is such that its potential is zero. So the sphere's induced charge is like an image charge arrangement.

Wait, I think the method of images might come into play here. In the case of a conductor, the image charge method is used to find the induced charges and the resulting electric fields. But I'm not sure how that applies here for potential energy.

So, let me think. The potential energy of the system would be the potential energy of the charge q in the field of the sphere, plus the potential energy stored in the sphere's induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere is neutral? Or no, because it's grounded. Hmm, no, wait. The sphere's induced charges are such that the sphere's overall charge depends on the surrounding. Let me think: when you bring a charge q near a neutral, ungrounded conducting sphere, the sphere will have induced charges +q' on the near side and -q' on the far side, but the total charge remains zero. But if the sphere is grounded, it can gain or lose electrons. So when you have an external charge q, the sphere would adjust its charge to maintain its potential at zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the sphere is a conductor and grounded. So the electric potential on the surface of the conductor is the same as the Earth's, which is zero. So the potential of the sphere is zero. Therefore, the potential due to the induced charges must be such that the total potential on the sphere is zero.

Wait, but the charge q is external. So the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q and the induced charges on the sphere must sum to zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the potential energy as the work done in assembling the charge and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, another approach: When you bring a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will create an image charge configuration. The potential energy of the system would be the energy due to the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere, plus the energy stored in the induced charges themselves.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall the formula for potential energy when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere. I remember that for a point charge near a conducting sphere, the potential energy is similar to the case of a point charge and its image charge.

Wait, in the method of images, for a sphere, the image charge q' is placed inside the sphere such that the distance from the center is d', where d' is the image distance. For a sphere of radius R, the image distance is given by d' = R^2 / d, but I might have that mixed up. Wait, no, the formula for the image charge when the sphere is uncharged is q' = -q, and it's placed at a distance d' = (R^2)/d from the center, in the opposite direction.

Wait, but in this case, the sphere is grounded, so it can have a net charge. Hmm. Does the image charge concept still apply? Or maybe not directly.

Wait, but perhaps the potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. The induced charges on the sphere are -q' and +q'', but since the sphere is grounded, the net charge on the sphere is zero. Wait, no, because the sphere is grounded, perhaps the induced charge isn't zero but adjusted so that the sphere's potential is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is the same as the energy stored in the electric field created by q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, let me think about the potential energy. The potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere, plus the work done to bring the induced charges into place, considering their own potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

Wait, but the sphere is a conductor, so the induced charges are on the surface. For a grounded sphere, the total charge on the sphere is such that the potential of the sphere is zero. So when a charge q is placed outside, the sphere will have induced charges that create a potential of zero on its surface.

Wait, maybe the potential at the surface due to the external charge q is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the potential due to the induced charges.

So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is V_sphere_due_to_q = kq / d, where d is the distance from the center of the sphere to q (which is given as d). Therefore, the induced charges on the sphere must create a potential of -kq/d at the sphere's surface, so that the sum is zero.

But how does this relate to the induced charges? Hmm, perhaps the induced charges can be treated as an image charge inside the sphere.

Wait, the image charge method says that the potential at any point outside the sphere is the same as if the charge were replaced by its image. So the image charge q' is inside the sphere, at a distance d' = (R^2)/d from the center. So the image charge is q' = -q*(R/d) ?

Wait, I think the image charge for a conducting sphere is given by q' = -q (R/d). So the image charge is at a distance d' = R^2 / d from the center, in the opposite direction. So the image charge would be inside the sphere.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Let me think again.

The image charge method for a conducting sphere: when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, such that the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the potential at the surface due to q is kq / D, where D is the distance between q and the sphere's center (which is d). The potential due to q' is kq' / R, because the image charge is at a distance R from the surface, so from the center it's (d' = R - R'?), wait no, if the image charge is inside the sphere, its distance from the center is d' = R^2 / D. So the potential at the surface due to q' is k q' / (d') = k q' * D/(R^2).

So, the sum of potentials at the surface must be zero:

kq/D + k q' * D/(R^2) = 0

Solving for q':

q' = - q * R^2 / D^2 * D = - q R^2 / D^2 * D? Wait, let me compute.

Wait, substituting:

kq/D + k q' * D/(R^2) = 0

Multiply both sides by D/(k):

q + q' * D^2/(R^2) = 0

So,

q' = - q * (R^2) / D^2

So image charge is q' = - q R^2 / D^2, and it's located at a distance d' = R^2 / D from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from q.

Wait, so the image charge is inside the sphere. So the total charge on the sphere is the sum of the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the net induced charge must be zero. Wait, no. Because the sphere is grounded, any induced charge can flow in or out. So the net charge on the sphere would be whatever is needed to maintain its potential at zero.

Wait, but in the image charge method, the sphere is considered as uncharged. So perhaps in this problem, the sphere being grounded doesn't change the approach, but just ensures that any induced charges are such that the potential is zero.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the potential energy.

The potential energy U of the system is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere. But because the sphere is conducting and grounded, the presence of q induces charges on the sphere. However, because the sphere is grounded, the total charge on it is such that the potential on its surface is zero.

Wait, but to calculate the potential energy, perhaps we can model it as the work done against the electric field created by the induced charges.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the potential energy as the sum of the work done to bring the charge q to its position, plus the work done to bring the induced charges into place.

Wait, but the sphere is conducting, so the induced charges are on the surface. The induced charges consist of a charge +Q and -Q, but since the sphere is grounded, perhaps the net charge on the sphere is zero. No, wait, the induced charges would be such that the sphere's potential is zero. So maybe the sphere can have a net charge Q, but that's determined by the condition that the potential on the sphere is zero.

Wait, but perhaps I should model the problem using the image charge method. Because the sphere is grounded, the image charge approach might not directly apply, but maybe I can still use it with some modification.

Wait, the image charge method in electrostatics is used for finding the potential or field due to a charge in the vicinity of a conductor. So, if we treat the sphere as a conductor, the image charge q' would be located inside the sphere, and the potential due to q and q' must equal zero at the sphere's surface.

So, the image charge is q' = - (q R^2) / d^2.

So the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy between q and q' plus the potential energy of the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, no, the image charge q' is just a model; the actual induced charges are on the sphere. So the potential energy U of the system is the work done to bring q and the induced charges into their positions.

But alternatively, the potential energy U can be calculated as the work done in assembling the charges, considering each other's fields.

Wait, when you bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges create a potential. The work done in moving q against this potential is the potential energy.

Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at the location of the charge q is the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. Wait, but the sphere is a conductor, so the potential is uniform on its surface. The potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charges would be V = k Q / (d'), where Q is the induced charge, and d' is the distance between q and the sphere's surface.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about another approach. The potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So, the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on its surface is zero. So if the sphere's induced charge is Q, then the potential at a distance d from the center (where q is placed) due to Q is V = k Q / d.

But the sphere being grounded implies that the potential at its surface is zero. So the potential due to the external charge q and the sphere's charge Q must cancel each other at the surface of the sphere.

Wait, let me think: The potential at the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = k q / d.

The potential due to the sphere's charge Q is V_Q = k Q / R, since the sphere is a conductor, and the charge Q is on the surface, so the distance from the center is R.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is the sum of potentials due to q and Q. Since the sphere is grounded, the total potential is zero.

So,

V_q + V_Q = 0

k q / d + k Q / R = 0

Solving for Q:

k Q/R = -k q/d

Q/R = - q/d

Q = - (q R)/d

Hmm, so the induced charge on the sphere is Q= - q R / d.

Wait, but that would be the case if the sphere were isolated. But since it's grounded, perhaps the sphere's charge can adjust to ensure its potential is zero. So that's what I did above.

So the sphere's charge is Q = - q R /d.

Wait, but the sphere's charge is induced by the external charge q. So the total charge on the sphere is Q = - q R / d.

Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, the sum of the induced charges and the ground's charges would be such that the sphere's potential is zero. So in that case, the sphere's induced charge is Q, and the ground provides the necessary charge to maintain zero potential.

But for the purpose of calculating potential energy, perhaps I can model the potential energy as the work done in bringing the charge q and the induced charge Q into their positions, considering the potential each creates.

So, the potential energy U is the sum of the work done in assembling these charges.

But the work is the integral of the force over distance, but that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the potential energy using the formula U = (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at the point where q is brought from infinity.

Wait, yes, the potential energy of a charge q in a potential V is U = q V.

But in this case, the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere's induced charge.

Wait, but the sphere's induced charge Q is -q R / d. What's the potential at the location of q due to this charge?

The distance between q and the sphere's center is d. The charge Q is on the sphere's surface, so the distance from q to each infinitesimal element of Q varies, but for a uniformly charged sphere, the potential outside is as if all charge is concentrated at the center. So the potential at distance d due to Q is V = k Q /d.

But wait, in this case, Q is the charge on the sphere, so V_sphere = k Q /d.

But Q is - q R/d.

So,

V_sphere = k (- q R/d) / d = - k q R / d².

Wait, but the potential energy U of the charge q in this potential is U = q * V_sphere.

So,

U = q * (-k q R / d²) = - k q² R / d².

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them exactly match that expression. Wait, but wait, this is just the potential energy due to the charge q and the sphere's induced charge. But perhaps I'm missing another term.

Wait, because when the charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges create a potential, and the charge q is in that potential. But also, the induced charges themselves have a potential energy due to their own configuration.

Wait, but the potential energy of the induced charges on the sphere would be (1/2) Q V', where V' is the potential at the sphere's surface due to the induced charges. Since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is zero, so V' is zero, and the potential energy due to the induced charges is zero. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy should include the energy stored in the electric field created by the induced charges and the charge q.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charge Q on the sphere.

But the sphere is grounded, so bringing the induced charge Q doesn't require any work because it's connected to the Earth. So only the work done in bringing q into the potential due to Q matters.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the induced charge Q is due to q. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the potential energy as the work done in assembling the two charges: q and Q, in the presence of each other.

So,

U = (1/2) (k q Q / d )

Because when you bring q and Q together, each contributes to the potential of the other.

So, substituting Q = - q R / d,

U = (1/2) k (q) (- q R/d) / d = (1/2) k (- q² R) / d²

Which simplifies to U = - (k q² R )/(2 d² )

Looking at the options, option D is U=- (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R²)

Hmm, but my result is -k q² R/(2 d² ), which isn't matching any of the options directly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Q.

Earlier, I thought that Q = - (q R)/d. But perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, let's go back. The sphere is grounded, so the potential at its surface is zero. The potential at the surface is the sum of potentials due to q and due to Q.

So,

V_sphere = V_q + V_Q = 0

V_q is the potential at the sphere's surface due to q: V_q = k q / (d - R), since the distance from q to the sphere's surface is d - R.

Wait, wait, no. The sphere's radius is R, and the charge q is placed at a distance d from the center. So the distance from q to the surface is d - R, but only on the side facing q. On the opposite side, the distance would be d + R. But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on the surface, so perhaps the potential due to q at the surface is k q / (d ), because the sphere's radius is R, and the distance from the center is d, so the potential at the surface is the same as if the charge were at the center, which is a simplification.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The potential at the surface due to an external charge q is k q / (d ), where d is the distance from the center of the sphere to q. Because for a sphere, the potential outside is as if the charge were at the center.

So,

V_q = k q / d.

The potential due to the sphere's charge Q is V_Q = k Q / R.

So,

k q / d + k Q / R = 0

So,

Q = - ( q R )/(d )

Same as before.

So, when we calculate the potential energy U of the system, which includes the work done to bring q and Q together, it's U = (1/2) (k q Q )/(d )

Substituting Q,

U= (1/2) * k * q * (- q R /d ) /d = - (1/2) k q^2 R / d^2

Hmm, so the potential energy is U = - (k q^2 R)/(2 d^2 )

Looking at the options, none of them match this expression. So what's wrong here?

Wait, maybe I'm missing the potential energy due to the induced charges on the sphere themselves.

Wait, the induced charges on the sphere (Q and -Q? Wait, no, in this case, the induced charge is just Q, but since the sphere is grounded, the net charge is Q plus any ground charge. But the sphere's induced charge is Q, which is - q R /d.

Wait, but the potential energy stored in the sphere's induced charges would be the energy due to their configuration. But since the sphere is a conductor, the charges are on the surface, and the potential on the surface is zero, so maybe the potential energy of the induced charges is zero.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere, considering the potential due to the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential experienced by q is the potential due to the sphere's induced charges.

But the sphere's induced charges create a potential at the location of q, which is V = k Q / d.

So,

U = q * V = q * (k Q/d )

But Q = - q R/d,

So,

U = q * (k (- q R/d ) / d ) = - k q^2 R / d^2

Which is the same as before.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the induced charge as an image charge inside the sphere, using the method of images. The image charge would be q' = - q (R/d)^2, placed at a distance d' = R^2 / d from the center, on the opposite side.

Then, the potential energy would be the work done to bring q and the image charge q' into place. But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps the image charge approach still applies.

In that case, the potential energy U is the work done in assembling the charge q and the image charge q' in each other's fields.

So,

U = (1/2) (k q q' ) / (distance between them)

The distance between q and q' is d + d', where d' is R^2/d.

So,

distance = d + (R^2)/d = (d^2 + R^2)/d

So,

U = (1/2) * k q * q' / [ (d^2 + R^2)/d ) ]

But q' = - q (R^2)/d^2

So,

U = (1/2) * k q * ( - q R^2 / d^2 ) / [ (d^2 + R^2)/d ) ]

Simplify:

= (1/2) * k * (- q^2 R^2) / d^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2 )

= (1/2) * k * (- q^2 R^2) / [ d (d^2 + R^2) ) ]

= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2 / [ d (d^2 + R^2) ) ]

Hmm, but none of the options match this either.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: U = - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²)

Option C: U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²)

Option D: U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R²)

Wait, but the denominator in my calculation is d (d² + R²), which is d^3 + d R^2.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a step. Alternatively, perhaps the image charge approach isn't applicable here because the sphere is grounded.

Wait, another idea: When the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, so the potential due to the external charge and the induced charges must cancel. So the potential at the surface due to q is V = k q/(d ), and the potential due to the induced charge Q is V' = k Q/(R ). So,

k q/d + k Q/R = 0 => Q = - q R/d.

So, the induced charge on the sphere is Q = - q R/d.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, plus the work done in bringing the induced charge Q into place.

But the sphere is grounded, so the work done in bringing Q doesn't cost any energy because it's connected to the Earth. So, the only work is bringing q to its position, against the potential due to Q.

Wait, but the potential at the location of q due to Q is V = k Q/(d - R )? No, wait, because the sphere's radius is R, and the charge q is at a distance d from the center. So the distance between q and a point on the sphere's surface is sqrt( (d)^2 + (R)^2 - 2 d R cosθ ), but that complicates things. Alternatively, for a uniformly charged sphere, the potential at a point outside is k Q / r, where r is the distance from the center. So the potential at q's position due to Q is V = k Q /d.

So,

U = q * V = q * (k Q/d ) = q * (k (- q R/d ) /d ) = - k q^2 R / d^2

But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy also includes the energy stored in the induced charges. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the system as a point charge and a grounded sphere, and the potential energy is given by the formula that includes the product of the charge and the potential at its location due to all sources except itself.

Wait, perhaps in the case of a grounded sphere, the potential at any external point is the same as if the sphere were uncharged, but with an image charge inside.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: U=- (1/2) k q² d/(d² +R²)

Option C: U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²)

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the system's potential energy as the work done to bring the charge q and the induced charge Q into their positions, considering each other's presence.

So,

U = (1/2) (k q Q )/ (d )

But Q = - q R/d, so,

U = (1/2) * k q * (- q R/d ) / d = - (1/2) k q² R / d²

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in which expression to use for Q.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for Q is different. Let me re-calculate.

The potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

The potential due to q at the surface is V_q = k q / (d )

The potential due to the induced charge Q on the sphere is V_Q = k Q / R

So,

V_q + V_Q = 0 => Q = - q R/d

Which is what I had before. So that's correct.

Hmm. So the potential energy is U = (1/2) (k q Q )/ d = (1/2) (k q (- q R/d )) / d = - (1/2) k q² R / d².

Wait, but looking again at the options, none of them have R/d². Option A has d/(d² + R² ), option C has R²/(d² - R² ), etc.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the image charge approach again.

In the image charge method, when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the image charge q' is inside the sphere at a distance d' = R²/d from the center. The image charge is q' = - q (R/d)^2.

So,

q' = - q R²/d².

The potential energy between q and q' is U = (1/2) k (q q') / (d + d').

Wait, because the distance between q and q' is d + d' (since q is at distance d from the center, and q' is at distance d' on the opposite side).

So,

distance = d + (R²/d ) = (d² + R² ) / d.

So,

U = (1/2) k (q) (- q R²/d² ) / [ (d² + R² )/d ]

= (1/2) * (-k q² R²/d² ) * d/(d² + R² )

= - (1/2) k q² R² / [ d (d² + R² ) ]

= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d (d^2 + R^2) )

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Wait, option A is U = - (1/2) k q² d/(d^2 + R^2)

Hmm, but that's different. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I have an error in the image charge approach. Let me think again.

In the image charge method, the sphere is neutral, but in this problem, the sphere is grounded. So perhaps the image charge approach doesn't apply here because the sphere can have a net charge.

Wait, but the sphere being grounded just means that its potential is zero. The image charge method assumes that the conductor is isolated, but perhaps it can be modified for a grounded sphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the same as when the sphere is uncharged, because the ground provides the necessary charge to cancel any potential.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is simply the same as the potential energy when the sphere is uncharged, because the ground doesn't contribute to the potential energy.

Wait, but the potential energy should account for the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R² )

Option C: - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

Hmm, another approach: the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded sphere is known to be U = - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Wait, does that match any of the options?

Looking at the options, option D is U= - (1/2) *k q² R/(d² - R² )

Wait, but in my earlier calculation using the image charge method, I ended up with U = - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d (d^2 + R^2) )

Which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is the same as the energy stored in the electric field created by the charge q and the sphere's induced charges.

The potential energy U can be expressed as the work done in assembling these charges, considering their mutual potentials.

So,

U = (1/2) k q Q / (distance between q and the sphere's center )

But the distance is d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k * q * (- q R/d ) / d = - (1/2) k q^2 R / d^2

But this doesn't match any option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is to use the distance between the charge and the sphere's surface, which is d - R. So,

U = (1/2) * k * q * Q / (d - R )

But that would complicate it further.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct image distance is d' = R^2/d, and the distance between q and q' is d + d' = (d^2 + R^2 )/d.

So,

U = (1/2) k q q' / distance = (1/2) k q ( - q R^2/d^2 ) * d/(d^2 + R^2 )

= (1/2) * (- k q^2 R^2 ) / (d (d² + R²) )

= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2 / [ d (d² + R^2) ) ]

Hmm, but this isn't matching any options. So perhaps the image charge approach isn't the right way.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the sphere as a capacitor. The charge q creates a potential, and the sphere being grounded can be considered as a conductor at zero potential. So the potential energy is the work done in bringing the charge q against the potential created by the sphere.

Wait, the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charges is V = k Q / d, where Q is the induced charge on the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, so:

k q / d + k Q / R = 0 => Q = - q R / d

So the potential energy of the charge q is U = q * V, where V is the potential due to the sphere's charges.

So,

U = q * (k Q /d ) = q * (k (- q R/d ) /d ) = - k q^2 R / d^2

But again, this doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the sphere's radius is R, so when the charge is placed at a distance d, perhaps the potential energy is calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the same as if the charge were interacting with an image charge located at a distance (d^2 - R^2 )/d from the center. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the induced charge Q on the sphere is - q R^2/d^2. Wait, earlier I thought Q was - q R/d, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, let's re-calculate Q.

The potential at the sphere's surface must be zero.

V = V_q + V_Q = 0

V_q is the potential at the surface due to q: V_q = k q/(d )

V_Q is the potential at the surface due to Q: V_Q = k Q/(R )

So,

k q/d + k Q/R = 0 → Q = - q R/d

This seems correct.

So, with this, the potential energy U is the work done to bring q from infinity to d, considering the potential due to Q.

But the potential at q's location due to Q is V = k Q / d.

So,

U = q * V = q * (k Q/d ) = q * (k (- q R/d ) /d ) = -k q^2 R / d^2

But again, this doesn't match any options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me check the options again.

Option A: U = - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d² + R² )

Option C: U= - (1/2) k q^2 R²/(d² - R² )

Hmm, another approach: The system's potential energy is equal to the work done to bring the charge q and the induced charges into their positions. But the induced charges on the sphere are - q R/d and + q R/d, but wait, no. Wait, I think I'm conflating concepts.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to think of the potential energy as the energy stored in the electric field between the charge and the sphere.

But since the sphere is a conductor, its potential is uniform and zero. So the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere's induced charges.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the potential energy can be found using the formula U = (k q^2 R )/( 2 (d^2 - R^2) )

Wait, but that's from memory, not sure.

Wait, another idea: the potential energy of the system is the same as the potential energy of a point charge in the field of a grounded sphere, which can be found by considering the image charge.

In that case, the image charge would be inside the sphere, and the potential energy would be the work done to bring q and the image charge into place.

The image charge is q' = - q R^2/d^2, located at a distance d' = R^2/d from the center.

The distance between q and q' is d + d' = d + R^2/d = (d^2 + R^2)/d.

So the potential energy U is (1/2) k ( q * q' ) / (distance )

= (1/2) k ( q * (- q R^2/d^2 ) ) / ( (d^2 + R^2)/d )

= (1/2) * (-k q^2 R^2 ) * d / (d^2 (d^2 + R^2) )

= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2 d / (d^2 (d^2 + R^2) )

= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2 / [ d (d^2 + R^2) ) ]

But again, this isn't matching any options. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, let me think about the denominator in option A: d^2 + R^2.

In my image charge approach, the denominator had d (d^2 + R^2 ), but option A has d over (d^2 + R^2 ).

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor of R somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct potential energy is U = - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Which is option D.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps when the sphere is grounded, the potential at the surface is zero, so the potential due to the charge q is canceled by the induced charges. So the potential energy is the energy due to the interaction between q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But perhaps the correct formula for Q is Q = - q d/(d^2 - R^2 ). No, I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and my earlier calculations.

Earlier, using the image charge method, I arrived at U = - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d (d^2 + R^2) )

But none of the options match this.

Wait, option A is U= - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R² )

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in including R^2 in the numerator. Maybe Q is -q (R /d ), so when calculating U, the R is in the numerator, but let's see:

U = (1/2) * k * q * Q / (d )

= (1/2) * k * q * (- q R/d ) / d

= (1/2) * k * (- q^2 R ) / d^2

Which is - (1/2) k q^2 R / d^2

But again, this doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the capacitance.

The sphere is a conductor, so its capacitance is C = 4 π ε0 R.

The charge induced on the sphere is Q = C V, where V is the potential difference.

But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, the potential at a point outside the sphere is given by the sum of potentials due to the induced charge and the charge q.

But I'm not making progress.

Another thought: the potential energy should be related to the product of the charge and the potential it creates. So,

U = (1/2) k q^2 + (1/2) k Q^2 + (k q Q ) / (d )

Wait, but I'm not sure if this applies here.

Wait, no, that's the formula for the potential energy of two point charges and their own fields. So,

U = (1/2) k ( q^2 + Q^2 + 2 q Q /d )

But since the sphere is a conductor, the potential due to Q is zero on the surface.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

U = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Which is option D.

But why?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is the same as the energy stored in a capacitor, which is (1/2) Q V.

In this case, the charge Q is - q R/d, and the potential V is k q/(d )

So,

U = (1/2) Q V = (1/2) ( - q R/d ) (k q/d )

= - (1/2) k q^2 R / d^2

Again, same as before.

Hmm. I'm not getting any of the options. Perhaps I should refer to the standard formula.

Wait, according to standard electrostatics, the potential energy U of a charge q placed at a distance d from a conducting sphere of radius R is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Which is option D.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere is derived as follows:

The potential energy is the work done in moving the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

The induced charge on the sphere is Q = - q R^2 / (d^2 )

Wait, but earlier calculation gave Q = - q R/d, which is different.

Hmm, I'm clearly missing something here. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct image charge is q' = - q (R^2)/(d^2 )

The distance between q and q' is d + (R^2/d )

So,

U = (1/2) k (q)(q') / (distance )

= (1/2) k q (- q R^2/d^2 ) / ( (d^2 + R^2)/d )

= (1/2) * (-k q^2 R^2 ) * d / (d^2 (d^2 + R^2) )

= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2 / [ d (d^2 + R^2) )

Which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U is equal to the product of the charge q and the potential at its position due to the induced charges on the sphere.

The potential at q's position due to the induced charges Q is V = k Q/(d )

But the sphere is grounded, so the potential at its surface is zero. Therefore, the potential at q's position is V = k Q/(d )

But the potential at the sphere's surface is zero, which is the sum of potentials due to q and Q.

So,

k q/(d ) + k Q/(R ) = 0 → Q= - q R/d.

So,

V = k (- q R/d ) / d = - k q R / d^2.

Then,

U = q * V = q * (- k q R / d^2 ) = - k q^2 R / d^2.

Again, not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2 )

Which is option A.

Wait, but where would the d in the numerator come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the potential energy is U = - (1/2) k q^2 (R) / (d^2 - R^2 )

Which is option D.

But I can't figure out how to get to that expression.

Well, perhaps I should just go with option A, as it seems more plausible.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system when a charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \), we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Induced Charges on the Sphere**:  
   When the charge \( q \) is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface. Due to grounding, the sphere's potential is zero. The potential at the sphere's surface due to \( q \) is \( V_q = \frac{kq}{d} \), and the potential due to the induced charge \( Q \) on the sphere is \( V_Q = \frac{kQ}{R} \). Since the total potential at the surface is zero, we have:  
   \[
   \frac{kq}{d} + \frac{kQ}{R} = 0 \implies Q = -\frac{qR}{d}.
   \]

2. **Potential Energy Calculation**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done in assembling the charge \( q \) and the induced charge \( Q \). This can be expressed as:  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k q Q / d.
   \]  
   Substituting \( Q = -\frac{qR}{d} \):  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k q \left(-\frac{qR}{d}\right) / d = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2 R}{d^2}.
   \]  
   However, this result does not match any of the given options directly.

3. **Image Charge Method**:  
   Using the method of images, the induced charge on the sphere can be modeled as an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere. The image charge is located at a distance \( d' = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center, and its magnitude is \( q' = -\frac{qR^2}{d^2} \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is \( d + d' = \frac{d^2 + R^2}{d} \). The potential energy is then:  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{\text{distance}} = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{qR^2}{d^2}\right)}{\frac{d^2 + R^2}{d}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2 R^2}{d(d^2 + R^2)}.
   \]  
   This also does not match any of the given options.

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   After analyzing the options, none of the derived expressions match directly. However, based on standard results in electrostatics, the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere is often expressed as:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{kq^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
