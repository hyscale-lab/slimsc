Okay, so I have this density matrix question in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on some of the quantum mechanics concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, wait, isn't that like a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>? Because each term is a projector (like a rank-1 matrix), and they're added together with equal coefficients. So ρ must be a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal, right?

Density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in a three-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and it's related to the density matrix elements.

Wait, let me recall. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector with components (x, y, z). So when I expand this, I get:

ρ = (1/2) [ [1 + x, y + iz], [y - iz, 1 - x] ]

Comparing this to the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's write that out in matrix form.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by 1/2, the matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal.

Now, let's compare this to the general form. The general density matrix ρ from the Bloch vector is (I + r·σ)/2, which when expanded is:

(1/2) * [[1 + x, y + iz], [y - iz, 1 - x]]

If I set this equal to [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], that means the off-diagonal terms must be zero, and the diagonal terms must be 0.5 each.

Looking at the off-diagonal terms, y + iz must be zero. And y - iz must also be zero. The only way that's possible is if y = 0 and z = 0. Because if y is non-zero, then adding iz (with z real if we take r as real vector) won't make the off-diagonal zero unless y and z are zero.

So that leaves us with the diagonal terms. The (1,1) element is (1 + x)/2, which equals 0.5. So 1 + x = 1 → x = 0. Similarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - x)/2 = 0.5. Again, 1 - x = 1 → x = 0.

So putting that together, the Bloch vector components are x=0, y=0, z=0. So r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but what's the significance of r being at the origin? Oh right, the origin in the Bloch sphere corresponds to the completely mixed state. Because the density matrix in that case is (I)/2, which is exactly what we have here. So the state is a maximally mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking back at the options:

A) (1,1,0)
B) (0,0,1)
C) (0,0,0)
D) (1,1,1)

So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(\left|0\right\rangle\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle\), with equal probabilities for each state. In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the general form of \(\rho\) is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + x & y + iz \\ y - iz & 1 - x \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal terms (\(y + iz\) and \(y - iz\)) must be zero, which implies \(y = 0\) and \(z = 0\). The diagonal terms (\(1 + x\) and \(1 - x\)) must equal 1, which implies \(x = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

The origin of the Bloch sphere corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix. Among the options:

- **A) \((1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.
- **B) \((0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different state.
- **C) \((0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as this is the origin and matches the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \((1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
