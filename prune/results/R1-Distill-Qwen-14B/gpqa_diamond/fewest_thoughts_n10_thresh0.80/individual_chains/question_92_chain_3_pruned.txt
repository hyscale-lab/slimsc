Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. The compound's structure is given as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks like an organic molecule with several substituents and double bonds.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Then, various bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. 

Wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation, right? So I remember that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. 

But the problem is, how do I approach this without the standard enthalpies of formation of the elements? Oh right, maybe I can use bond energies to calculate it. Because bond energies are the energies required to break bonds, and formation involves making bonds. So the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formation reaction from elements and then using bond energies.

Let me think. The general formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products] 

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the enthalpy change
