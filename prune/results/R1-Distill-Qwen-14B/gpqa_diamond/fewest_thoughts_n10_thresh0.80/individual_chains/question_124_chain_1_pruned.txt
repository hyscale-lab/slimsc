Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Oh wait, right, it's gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But I'm not sure if I need to calculate the velocity here or just use some relation involving the detector's radius.

Wait, the particles are traveling from the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel before decaying (or before reaching the detector's inner walls) is the radius, which is 30 meters. But some of them decay before reaching the walls, so the fraction that makes it depends on how long they live, which is affected by their gamma factor due to time dilation.

Oh, right! The proper lifetime (tau) of the particle is the same for all observers. The lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as gamma times tau. So the distance the particle can travel before decaying is v multiplied by gamma tau. Since the particle is moving at a high velocity, we can approximate v as approximately c, maybe? Because ultra-relativistic velocities mean v is very close to c.

Wait, let's think: the maximum distance the particle can travel is when it doesn't decay at all, which is v * t. But the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the distance is v * gamma tau. But for the particle to reach the detector wall, this distance has to be at least the radius of the detector, right? Or wait, in the problem, it's about the probability that a particle reaches the wall before decaying. So perhaps it's a matter of the particles' path length compared to the detector's radius.

Let me rephrase: The particles are produced at the center. They travel outward. The ones that reach the inner walls
