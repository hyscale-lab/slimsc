Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given information is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm. Wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'plx' in some contexts. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. 

I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if I can express N in terms of d, that might help.

Starting with N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5.

Wait, but the question asks about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh wait, no, it's about the number of stars in that region as a function of distance. Wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of the number density or flux.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars would increase with distance^5? That seems really steep. But looking at the options, option B is r^5. But wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Oh wait, maybe it's about the change in number per unit distance. So actually, perhaps I should think about the differential number, like dN/dr.

Wait, N is proportional to d^5. So dN/dr would be the derivative of d^5 with respect to d, which is 5d^4. So that would suggest that the number of stars increases with r^4. But wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the question is simply about N as a function of distance, not the rate of change. But the way the question is phrased, it's about how the number changes with distance. So perhaps it's about the trend—does the number increase or decrease, and how?

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. But if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases rapidly. So per unit distance, the number is increasing by a factor of r^5. Or wait, perhaps the question is asking about the number in a shell of thickness dr at a distance r. How does that number change with r?

Wait, the number of stars in a small volume element would be proportional to the volume times the number density. In this case, the number density (stars per unit volume) is proportional to r^5. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be number density multiplied by the volume. So that's (k * r^5) * (4π r² dr) = 4π k r^7 dr. So the number in a shell is proportional to r^7. But the question isn't asking about the total in a shell, but how the number (as a function) changes with distance. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars observed, N, is given to vary with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance, so N is proportional to (distance)^5. So when distance increases, N increases as d^5.

But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's the rate of change of N with respect to distance. That would be dN/dr. Since N = k * d^5, dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in N per unit distance is proportional to d^4, or r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The problem states: "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5. So when distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

But the question is, how does the number change per unit range of distance, meaning the derivative dN/dr is 5d^4. So the change is proportional to r^4. Which would correspond to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking about the trend, not the derivative. Like, if the distance doubles, how does the number change? Then it's r^5, which is option B. But the wording says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Ah, the key part is "per unit range of distance". So that's a hint that they are looking for the derivative, dN/dr. So if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. Therefore, the answer would be option C, r^4.


The question involves understanding how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question specifically asks about how the number of stars changes "per unit range of distance," which implies the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto d^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases with the fourth power of distance.

Thus, the correct answer is that the number of stars changes with distance as \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
