Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)? The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is typically a transition metal catalyst, like Ruthenium-based, I think. So when an alkene reacts with Grubbs, it can undergo different types of metathesis reactions, like ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure of that. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So Pentane has five carbons. So 1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. But wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl branch on carbon 3.

Wait, wait, let me count. Pent is five carbons. So numbering from 1 to 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃) or something? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Structure: The main chain is five carbons, double bond from C1 to C2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, pent is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: CH₂=, Carbon 2: CH-, Carbon 3: CH(CH3), then carbons 4 and 5.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it out. Let's see:

The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, because that's five carbons in the main chain. Wait, wait:

1: CH₂=, 2: CH-, connected to 3, which is CH(CH3), then 4 is CH₂, and 5 is CH3.

Wait, that makes the structure CH
