Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the possible decays of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. So here, X is a bosonic field, and ψ_f probably represents fermion fields.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to the mass of X. Because in particle physics, a particle can only decay into particles whose combined rest mass is less than or equal to its own.

Looking at the options, they all list various fermion-antifermion pairs. So X can decay into these pairs if the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but fermions come in different types, like quarks and leptons. Let's list the masses of the known particles. For quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, top quarks are really heavy, around 173 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So any decay involving a top quark is immediately out of the question.

Leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their antiparticles. The masses are e: ~0.0005 GeV, mu: ~0.105 GeV, tau: ~1.78 GeV. So for a pair, like e+ e-, the combined mass is about 2 * 0.0005 ≈ 0.001 GeV, which is way below 6 GeV. Similarly, mu+ mu- would be about 0.21 GeV (0.105 * 2), which is also fine. Tau pair: 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV.

Now, looking at the quarks. The up and down quarks are light, but they're actually massless compared to GeV scales. Wait, but their mass is like a few MeV. So for u and d quarks, their mass is negligible, so a pair would have negligible mass. So uū and dđ would be allowed.

Strange quarks are heavier. The strange quark mass is around 95 MeV (0.095 GeV). So s and s̄ would be about 0.19 GeV. That's way below 6 GeV.

Charm quarks are heavier. Their mass is around 1.2-1.5 GeV. So a c and c̄ pair would sum to about 2.4-3 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

Bottom quarks are much heavier. The bottom mass is about 4.1-4.7 GeV. So a b and b̄ pair would sum to 8.2-9.4 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So that's not allowed. So X cannot decay into b b̄.

So looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: b b̄,... but wait, I just concluded that X can't decay into b b̄ because their mass is too high. So option A includes b b̄ which is wrong, so A is not correct.

Option B: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau, and e and mu pairs. Wait, but where's the tau? Oh, option B has tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. That all looks possible. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option C
