Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I need to calculate the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states with definite values. The operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, but how does that relate to the components P_x, P_y, and P_z given? Oh right, the operator P is the component of angular momentum along direction n, which is a combination of the x, y, and z components. But wait, the direction n lies in the x-z plane, so the direction vector would be something like (n_x, 0, n_z). So, the operator P would be proportional to n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the component of angular momentum along a direction is n⋅P, where n is the unit vector.

Wait, no, P is the angular momentum operator. So maybe the operator in question is the component along n, which would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z + n_y P_y. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Right, so the operator is a linear combination of P_x and P_z.

The problem gives the expressions for P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, let me write them down.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P is given by:

P = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction vector is (n_x, 0, n_z). And it's a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.
