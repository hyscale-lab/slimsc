Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each described by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, so first, I need to recall what an eigenvector is. An eigenvector of an operator corresponds to a specific eigenvalue, meaning when the operator acts on the eigenvector, it scales it by that eigenvalue. So, for an operator matrix M, we're looking for a vector v such that Mv = λv, where λ is the eigenvalue.

But wait, in this case, the operator is given along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. I remember that in quantum mechanics, for spin-½ particles like a muon, the spin operator along any direction can be expressed as a combination of the Pauli matrices. The eigenstates of spin along a particular direction are aligned (spin-up) or opposite (spin-down) to that direction.

The problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which is the spin-up state along the direction n. So, the eigenvector we're looking for should be the spin-up state along n.

The direction n lies in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So, n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe from the x-axis? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis. So, if n is in the x-z plane, φ (the azimuthal angle) is zero. So, the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since the problem says it's arbitrary, θ can be any angle.

The spin operator along a direction n is given by P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So, first, I need to compute the matrix for the operator P. Let's write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, because for a direction in the x-z plane, the components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, wait. Wait, I think I might have gotten that mixed up. Oh wait, no, in the standard spherical coordinates, a point in the x-z plane would have y=0, and the direction can be represented as (sinθ * cosφ, 0, sinθ * sinφ) but wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the coordinate system.
