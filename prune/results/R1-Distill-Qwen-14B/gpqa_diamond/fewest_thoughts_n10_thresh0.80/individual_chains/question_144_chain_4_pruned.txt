Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mean decay distance for this meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, I need to find the lifetime of the particle. The lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but more accurately, τ is the inverse of the width Γ multiplied by some constants. Oh right, the formula is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I have to be careful with the units here.

The width Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, but units can be tricky. I think Γ is the total decay width, which is in energy units. So to get the lifetime, I need to convert Γ from MeV to seconds. Let me recall the conversion factors. I remember that 1 MeV is approximately 1.602e-13 joules. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Actually, the Planck constant ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Wait, so if Γ is in GeV, I can use that directly. Oh wait, wait, the given Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let's see, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32. Let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ is approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the particle. The particle is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the mass, implying it's moving relativistically. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c². So γ is E / (m c²). Since E and m are in GeV, and c² is in (GeV/(rest mass energy))^2? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta (β) and gamma (γ) using the energy.

Alternatively, the velocity can be found using the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. The energy squared is equal to (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So E² = (p
