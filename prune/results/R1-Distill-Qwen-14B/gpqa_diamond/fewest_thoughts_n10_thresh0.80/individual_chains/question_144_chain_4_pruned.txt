Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from my studies. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each a different value in meters.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle relates to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. Oh wait, but that's for the lifetime. Once we have the lifetime, the mean decay distance would be the velocity times the lifetime, right? So distance d = v * τ.

But wait, how do I get the velocity v of the meson X? I think I can get that from its energy and mass. Let me recall some formulas. The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E/(m c²). 

Wait, but the units here are GeV and MeV. I need to make sure I convert everything to standard units. Let's see. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, that's a useful number because it can help convert between GeV and seconds.

So the width Γ is given in MeV, which is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV: 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

The mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = let me compute that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 seconds? Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Yeah.

Now, I need to find the velocity of the meson X. The production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. So the gamma factor is γ = E/(m c²) but wait, since E and m are both in GeV, but c² is in terms of (GeV/c²)^2, but when using units where c=1 (like in particle physics), E = γ m c² simplifies because c is in units such that c=1. So in that case, E = γ m, so γ = E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... or 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6667. Then, the velocity v can be found from gamma. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me solve for v. 

Alternatively, beta (β) is v/c, so beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)}. Let's compute beta. Since gamma is 20/3: 20/3 is about 6.6667. So 1/gamma² is (9/400) = 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c.

Wait, let me get that more accurately. Let me calculate it more precisely. 

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 80 / 12 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666666667.

So, gamma = 20/3.

Beta squared (v²/c²) = 1 - (1/gamma²) = 1 - (9/(400)) = (400 -9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let me compute that. The square of 0.9887 is approximately 0.9775, yes. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me think, 0.9887 squared is about 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887c. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean decay distance is d = v * τ.

We have τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds, and v ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So d ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 2.966 *2.056875 * 1e-16.

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 2.966 * (approx 0.05688) → 0.1688.

So total about 5.932 + 0.1688 = 6.1008.

So d ≈ 6.1008e-16 meters? Wait, but wait, that doesn't match any options. Hmm. The options are around 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, tau is ħ/Γ. So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let me compute that again.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That's correct.

v is 0.9887c, so 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So d = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ as above, approx 6.1008. So 6.1008e-16 m. But looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16, option D is 4.06e-16. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma or beta.

Wait, let me recompute gamma. Gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but when using units where c=1, E=γ m, so gamma is E/m. So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma is 8 /1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667. That's correct.

Beta calculation: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9). 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, correct.

Wait another approach: Maybe the calculation of v is wrong because I didn't account for units properly. Oh wait, when you calculate v, it's beta c, so beta is just a number, so v = beta * c. So 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s is correct.

Hmm, but I get approximately 6.1e-16 meters, but the options are all about 4 or 5 times 1e-15 or 1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, did I mix up GeV and MeV somewhere? Let me check the units again.

Gamma was 0.32 GeV, correct.
