Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry question. Let's see what it's about. The question involves binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds, and various reactions are described involving these substances.

Let me break down the information step by step. 

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that stands for the degree of fluorination, or maybe oxidation state of fluorine?) is 31.96%. Wait, no, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass? Because 31.96% sounds familiar. Fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19, so 19/60 is roughly 31.67%, which is close. Oh wait, 19/60 is 0.3167 or 31.67%, which matches 31.96% closely. So maybe A2 has a formula where fluorine makes up about 31.96% by mass. Hmm, 19/(something) = 0.3196. Let me calculate: 19/x = 0.3196 → x ≈ 60. So the formula is likely YF. Because Y plus F in a 1:1 ratio would have F as 19/(Y+19) = 0.3196. Let's solve for Y:

19/(Y + 19) = 0.3196 → Y +19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 60 → Y ≈ 41. So Y's atomic weight is about 41. What element has an atomic weight around 41? Well, Ga is about 70, As is around 75, maybe Germanium is 72. Hmm, wait, 41 is closer to something else. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, if the formula is YF, then the molecular weight is Y + 19. The mass percent of F is (19)/(Y +19) * 100. That's given as 31.96%. So 19/(Y+19) = 0.3196 → Y +19 = 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 60. So Y ≈ 41. What element has an atomic mass around 41? Let's think: Scandium is about 45, Titanium is 48, Vanadium is 51. Oh, maybe it's not a main group element. Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the formula isn't YF but YF2 or something else.
