Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it out.

So the question says that two stars, both with masses similar to the Sun, each have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method is used to detect them. 

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms in the spectral line. Planet #2's host star has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves in a small orbit around the barycenter, and this causes the spectral lines to shift. The amplitude of this shift (the velocity semi-amplitude) depends on several factors: the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star, among others.

Wait, the formula I think I need is the one that relates the RV semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P) and other parameters. Let me try to recall it. I think the formula is something like K = (v) where v is a function involving (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) multiplied by some other terms. But I might be mixing up some details.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to use the formula involving the mass function and the RV semi-amplitude. The RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit. The semi-amplitude K can be given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day)) )^(1/3) ) 

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies since (1 - e²)^0.5 becomes 1. Also, since M_planet is much smaller than M
