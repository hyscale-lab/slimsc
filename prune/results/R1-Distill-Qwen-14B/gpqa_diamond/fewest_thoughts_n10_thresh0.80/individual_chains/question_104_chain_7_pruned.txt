Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about comparing the orbital periods of two planets around stars with the same mass. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and their orbits are circular.

Wait, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves back and forth due to the planet's gravity, and this causes a shift in the spectral lines. The size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, right? Or maybe the orbital period doesn't directly affect the shift, but the mass and distance do. 

The problem says that Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's. 

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is something like K = (V) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )) ) * some factors, but wait, maybe I should look up the exact equation.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) divided by P^(1/3), but wait, let me re-examine that. Alternatively, maybe K is proportional to (M_p) * (1/(M_star))^(1/3) * 1/(P^(1/3)) ) something's not clicking right. Alternatively, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of
