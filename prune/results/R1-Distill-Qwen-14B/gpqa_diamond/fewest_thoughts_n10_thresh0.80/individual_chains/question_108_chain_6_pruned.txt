Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember from my studies that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties of materials due to the alignment of electron spins. But wait, the question mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Oh right, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, which can take values from -l to +l in integer steps.

The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis (so it's along the z-axis). The values of m are small, and B is 1 Tesla. I need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think here is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series in hydrogen, like the H-alpha line.

So, the problem is essentially asking whether the magnetic interaction energy (paramagnetic term) is much smaller than, similar to, or much larger than the transition energy ΔE.

First, let me think about what each term represents.

The paramagnetic coupling term is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electrons and the external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect (since this is related to the magnetic interaction) is something like H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but wait—wait, orbital magnetic quantum number m is orbital, but electrons also have spin. Oh, but the question says it's the paramagnetic coupling term. Oh, paramagnetism is due to the electron spin, right? So maybe the magnetic moment is due to spin here. Or wait, the orbital contribution is smaller in some cases, but I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no. The question says it's the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the spin-orbit interaction. Hmm, no, spin-orbit is a different effect. The paramagnetic term is probably the Zeeman effect due to the spin magnetic moment. Oh, but the orbital magnetic moment is about the orbital angular momentum, so maybe the paramagnetic term is the orbital contribution. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the paramagnetic term refers to the spin part, but the question specifies m as the orbital quantum number. Wait, the question says "for small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)", so m here is the orbital m, not spin. So the paramagnetic term is from the orbital magnetic moment.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the orbital magnetic moment is usually smaller than the spin contribution. Wait, but the specific term in the Hamiltonian is the Zeeman term, which can be split into spin and orbital parts. But wait, maybe the question is considering the orbital contribution only.

Wait, perhaps I should write down the relevant equations.

The energy of the Zeeman effect is given by H_Zeeman = - (μ · B), where μ is the magnetic moment. For
