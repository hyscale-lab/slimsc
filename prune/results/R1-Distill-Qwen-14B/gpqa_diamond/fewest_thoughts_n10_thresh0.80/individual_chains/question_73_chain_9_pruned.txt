Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Alright, first part: finding the relative speed. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, speeds don't just add up normally. If one object is moving at u and another at v in the same direction, you can't just subtract them. You have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), right?

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because if both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference divided by 1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared. But wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The relative velocity of the slower one from the faster one's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Because u is the speed of the first astronaut from the lab frame, and v is the speed of the second from the lab frame. So to find how fast the second is moving relative to the first, we use u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, how fast is the second moving? Since the second is slower, the relative speed shouldn't be greater than c, right.

So plugging in the numbers: u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So u - v is 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (u v)/(c²) = 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) /
