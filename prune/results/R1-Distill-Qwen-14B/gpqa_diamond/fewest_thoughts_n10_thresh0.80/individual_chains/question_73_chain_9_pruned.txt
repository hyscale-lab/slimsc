Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. There's a specific formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh wait, right! The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed should be the difference between their speeds divided by the appropriate gamma factors. Let me think: when one object is moving at v1 relative to another that's moving at v2, their relative speed u is given by (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So I should plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c.

Calculating that: numerator is (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which I can approximate as 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. That's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy of each astronaut is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma. So each astronaut's energy is gamma*m*c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate the energy for each and add them together.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc². 

Wait, but are the options using precise calculations? Let me double-check the gamma calculations.

For the first astronaut: (0.6c)^2 is 0.36 c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. That's correct.

For the second: (0.5c)^2 is 0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root of 0.75 is about 0.8660, so
