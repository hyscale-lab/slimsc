Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. I remember cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine, which forms product 1. 

Wait, what happens when a ketone is treated with bromine? Oh right, I think it's a bromination reaction. But wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which is an electrophilic site. So when you add bromine, which is a dienophile, maybe it undergoes some kind of addition reaction. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe it's about the enol formation. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via enolates. Oh wait, no, wait, I think when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br2), it can undergo electrophilic addition. But wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which is a good electrophile. So bromine might add to the carbonyl.

Wait, but how? Oh, Br2 adds across the carbonyl in a way. Wait, I think cyclohexanone would react with Br2 to form a dibromide. But wait, wait. Another possibility: maybe the reaction is a bromination via a radical mechanism, but that's less likely in this context. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexanone reacting with bromine in an acid or base condition. Hmm.

Wait, I think when ketones react with Br2 in presence of a base, it can form a bromohydrin. Or wait, maybe it's an addition of Br across the carbonyl. Let me think. The mechanism for that would be: the carbonyl oxygen attacks Br2, which is a di-electrophile. So the carbonyl oxygen would attack Br, opening the Br-Br. So the ketone would add two bromines, one on each side of the carbonyl. Wait, but that's for aldehydes and ketones. So cyclohexanone would add Br to the carbonyl, forming a geminal dibromide. So product 1 would be 1,1-dibromocyclohexane?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has the structure (CH2)5C-O, but I think the correct structure is
