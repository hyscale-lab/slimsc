Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let me think it through.

The question asks which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. Let me look at each option carefully.

Alright, starting with option a: It's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Wait, Earth's density is already known, right? Earth has a density around 5.5 g/cm³, which is pretty high because it's a rocky planet with a metal core. So, if this planet is Earth-like in both mass and radius, its density must be about the same as Earth's.

Moving on to option b: The planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the question provides the density here directly. So this planet's density is exactly the same as Earth's. So it's not higher than Earth. So maybe it's not the answer, but let me check the others.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition means the density should be the same as Earth, right? Because density is mass divided by volume. But wait, if the mass increases by 5 times, but volume depends on the radius. Wait, same composition implies same density, but how does mass affect that?

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If a planet's composition is the same as Earth, then its density is the same as Earth's. Because density is an intrinsic property. So whether it's more massive or smaller, the density remains the same. Unless... wait, if the planet's radius is larger, the volume would be bigger, but if the density is same, mass would scale with volume. But in this case, the composition is same, so density same as Earth. So the density of option c is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, same density as Earth. So density is 5.5 g/cm³ in this case too.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think about how mass affects radius. For planets with same composition, mass and radius are related. Because mass scales with volume (V), and volume is (4/3)πr³. So if a planet has more mass, its radius increases, but how does that affect density? Well, if you double the radius, the volume
