Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given data are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. 

Wait, wait. I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) for a crystal plane can be found using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters. But wait, I think the formula is a bit more complex because it depends on the crystal system.

Rhombohedral systems are a type of hexagonal or cubic system, but I think in this case, the lattice is rhombohedral, which means all edges are equal, but the angles between them are not 90 degrees. So the lattice is a rhombohedron—right, a cube that's been skewed so all sides are the same length but the angles are equal but not 90 degrees.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, I think, is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(180 - α) )) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another approach is using the general formula for any crystal system. The general formula for the interplanar distance is:

d =
