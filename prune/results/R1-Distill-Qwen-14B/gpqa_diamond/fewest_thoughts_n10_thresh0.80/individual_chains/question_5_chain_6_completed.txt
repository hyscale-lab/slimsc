Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in the question, the operator is written as vec P, so it's a vector operator, meaning it has components P_x, P_y, P_z. And the question is about finding the eigenvector of P along a direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, they might be asking for the eigenvector of the component of P along vec n, i.e., (vec P · vec n). Because the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the total operator P (the vector) are more complicated, but when you project it onto a specific direction, you get an operator whose eigenvectors are well-known, like spin-up and spin-down along that direction.

So, the problem is probably asking for the eigenvector of (vec P · vec n), where vec n is in the x-z plane. And the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

But let me read the question again. It says, "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator vec P for a muon along an arbitrary direction vec n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2." Oh wait, so operator vec P is a vector, but perhaps the question is about the component of P along n. Because the eigenvalue equation for a vector operator isn't straightforward; each component has its own eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator in question is the component of P along n. That makes more sense because eigenvalues of such an operator would be ±ħ/2, which are the possible outcomes for spin-1/2 systems.

So, let's model this. The operator in the direction n is P_n = (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z). Since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, where |ψ> is the eigenvector.

Now, the components of P are given:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P_n = (P_x n_x + P_z n_z) * (ħ/2), because n_y is zero.

Wait, no. Let me compute that properly. Since each P component is multiplied by ħ/2, but the operator P_n will be (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by ħ/2? Wait, no, because P_x is itself (ħ/2) times the matrix. So let me write each term:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P_n = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z = (ħ/2) [ n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Factor out (ħ/2), so:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let me compute that matrix.

The first row would be (n_z * 1 + 0, n_x * 1 + 0) → [n_z, n_x]
The second row would be (n_x * 1, -n_z * 1) → [n_x, -n_z]

Wait no, wait. Let me actually compute the matrix:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z * [[1,0], [0,-1]] gives [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]
Adding these two gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So, the matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) times that.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Substituting, (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to get:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ> = |ψ>

Which gives:

n_z ψ_1 + n_x ψ_2 = ψ_1
n_x ψ_1 -n_z ψ_2 = ψ_2

Wait, let me write the equations properly. Let the eigenvector be a column vector [ψ_1; ψ_2], so:

n_z ψ_1 + n_x ψ_2 = ψ_1 → (n_z -1) ψ_1 + n_x ψ_2 = 0  → equation (1)
n_x ψ_1 - (n_z + 1) ψ_2 = 0 → equation (2)

Hmm. Let's solve these equations. From equation (1):

(n_z -1) ψ_1 = -n_x ψ_2 → ψ_1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] ψ_2

Wait, but let's look for non-trivial solutions, so ψ_2 can't be zero, assuming ψ_1 is non-zero. So substituting ψ_1 from equation (1) into equation (2):

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z-1) ψ_2 ] - (n_z +1) ψ_2 = 0

Multiply through:

[ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) ) - (n_z +1) ] ψ_2 = 0

Since ψ_2 isn't zero, the coefficient must be zero:

(-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) ) - (n_z +1) = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = 0

Wait, (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z^2 -1. So:

- n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1) = 0
→ -n_x^2 -n_z^2 + 1 = 0
→ n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1

Which is true because n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. So the equations are consistent, and we can find the eigenvector.

So from equation (1):

ψ_1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] ψ_2

Let me write this as ψ_1 = [ n_x / (1 - n_z) ] ψ_2

But this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, we can write n in terms of an angle θ, where n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Because in the x-z plane, the angle θ would be measured from the x-axis towards z. So, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

Wait, but wait: in standard spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. But here, since the direction is in the x-z plane, θ can be measured from the x-axis. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the angle between n and the x-axis.

So, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Then, n_y=0.

Substituting into the equation for ψ_1:

ψ_1 = [n_x/(1 - n_z)] ψ_2 = [cosθ/(1 - sinθ)] ψ_2

Hmm. Let's compute this expression. Let me factor in some trigonometric identities. For instance, 1 - sinθ can be expressed using the identity 1 - sinθ = (sin(θ/2) - cos(θ/2))^2, but perhaps a better approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

cosθ/(1 - sinθ) = [cosθ (1 + sinθ)] / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] = [cosθ (1 + sinθ)]/(1 - sin²θ) ) = [cosθ (1 + sinθ)] / cos²θ = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ

So, ψ_1 = [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ] ψ_2

Which can be written as ψ_1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] ψ_2

Let me set ψ_2 = cosθ, then ψ_1 would be (1 + sinθ). But wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to let ψ_2 = cosθ, but wait, let's see.

Wait, let's pick ψ_2 as a variable, say, set ψ_2 = A, and then ψ_1 = [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ ] A.

Then, the eigenvector is [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * A ; A ]

But I need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |ψ_1|^2 + |ψ_2|^2 = 1.

So,

| (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * A |^2 + |A|^2 = 1

Let's compute this:

[ (1 + sinθ)^2 / cos^2θ ) + 1 ] |A|^2 = 1

Factor out 1/cos²θ:

[ (1 + 2 sinθ + sin²θ) + cos²θ ) ] / cos²θ |A|^2 = 1

But since sin²θ + cos²θ =1,

(1 + 2 sinθ + 1 ) / cos²θ |A|^2 =1 → (2 + 2 sinθ)/cos²θ |A|^2 =1.

So,

|A|^2 = cos²θ/(2(1 + sinθ)).

Hmm, perhaps simplifying this:

Denominator 2(1 + sinθ)

We can write cos²θ as (1 - sin^2θ) = (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ). So,

cos²θ/(2(1 + sinθ)) = (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ)/(2(1 + sinθ)) ) = (1 - sinθ)/2.

So, |A|^2 = (1 - sinθ)/2 → A = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) , but I need to consider phase factors as well, but perhaps we can set A to be real for simplicity, since the eigenvector is unique up to a phase.

So, ψ_1 = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * A, and ψ_2 = A.

Substituting A = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ):

ψ_1 = (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Let me compute (1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) = 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So, (1 + sinθ) * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) ) = sqrt( (1 + sinθ)^2 * (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Wait, alternative approach: Let me compute ψ_1 and ψ_2.

Let me set A = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Then,

ψ_1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] * A
= [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):

= sqrt(2) (1 + sinθ) * sqrt( (1 - sinθ) ) / ( 2 cosθ )

Hmm, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity that can help here.

But let me think about another approach. Perhaps I can express this in terms of half-angle formulas.

Recall that sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)
And 1 + sinθ = (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))^2
Similarly, 1 - sinθ = (cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2))^2

Wait, 1 + sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2 + π/4)^2? Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, 1 + sinθ = (sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))^2.

Let me compute:

(sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2))^2 = sin²(θ/2) + 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) + cos²(θ/2) = 1 + sinθ.

Yes, because 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) = sinθ.

So,

sqrt( (1 + sinθ) ) = sin(θ/2) + cos(θ/2)
sqrt( (1 - sinθ) ) = cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2) (since cos(θ/2) > sin(theta/2) for theta in 0 to pi/2, which this direction would be since in x-z plane)

So, let me try this.

ψ_1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

= [ (1 + sinθ) * sqrt(1 - sinθ) ) ] / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

Expressed as:

= [ (sqrt(1 + sinθ) ) * sqrt(1 - sinθ) )^1 ] / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

Wait, because (1 + sinθ) * sqrt(1 - sinθ) = sqrt(1 + sinθ) * (1 - sinθ)^(1/2) * (1 + sinθ)^(1/2) )= sqrt( (1 + sinθ)(1 - sinθ) ) * (1 + sinθ)^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me instead compute each term.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parameterize the eigenvector in terms of theta, the angle of n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the eigenvector I'm getting is [ (1 + sinθ)/cosθ * A , A ]

But substituting A = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

So,

ψ_1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] * sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )
= [ (1 + sinθ) * sqrt(1 - sinθ) ) ] / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

But, 1 + sinθ = (sinθ/2 + cosθ/2)^2, so sqrt(1 + sinθ) = sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2).

Similarly, sqrt(1 - sinθ) = cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2).

So,

ψ_1 = [ (sin(theta/2) + cos(theta/2)) * (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)) ) ] / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

Multiply numerator terms:

= [ (cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2)) ] / ( cosθ * sqrt(2) )

Because (a+b)(a−b)=a²−b².

But cos^2(theta/2) - sin^2(theta/2) = cos(theta), so numerator becomes cos(theta).

So,

ψ_1 = cos(theta) / ( cos(theta) * sqrt(2) ) ) = 1/sqrt(2)

Hmm, that's neat. So ψ_1 is 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, what about ψ_2?

ψ_2 = A = sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 )

Which is sqrt( (1 - sinθ)/2 ) = sqrt( [ (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) )^2 ] / 2 )

Because 1 - sinθ = [cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)]^2.

So,

ψ_2 = |cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)| / sqrt(2)

Assuming theta is between 0 and pi/2 (since n is in x-z plane and we're considering +hbar/2 eigenvalue), so cos(theta/2) > sin(theta/2), so the absolute value can be removed.

Thus,

ψ_2 = [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

So, the eigenvector is:

ψ_1 = 1/sqrt(2)
ψ_2 = [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2 )

Wait, but earlier, we had ψ_1 = [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] * A. Substituting A, we found ψ_1 = 1/sqrt(2). Hmm, that's interesting. So the first component is 1/sqrt(2), and the second component is [ cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) ] / sqrt(2).

But wait, let's think if this makes sense. If theta is 0, meaning direction along x, then n=(1,0,0). Then, the eigenvector should be the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's check.

For theta=0, n_x=1, n_z=0.

Then, from our earlier analysis, the eigenvector components would be:

ψ_1 = 1/sqrt(2)
ψ_2 = [ cos(0) - sin(0) ] / sqrt(2 ) = [1 - 0]/sqrt(2 ) = 1/sqrt(2 )

So the eigenvector is [1,1]^T / sqrt(2), which is indeed the eigenvector of P_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2, since P_x |+x> = (ħ/2) |+x>.

Similarly, if theta=pi/2, then n is along z. Then,

n_x=0, n_z=1.

So eigenvector would be:

ψ_1 = 1/sqrt(2)
ψ_2 = [ cos(pi/4) - sin(pi/4) ] / sqrt(2 ) = ( sqrt(2)/2 - sqrt(2)/2 ) / sqrt(2) ) = 0.

So the eigenvector is [1,0]^T / sqrt(2), which is the eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

That makes sense.

So the normalized eigenvector is [1/sqrt(2), (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2))/sqrt(2) ].

But wait, the options given need to match this. Let's look at the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). That looks like an eigenvector, but without normalization, perhaps. Let me compute the normalization. cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1, so option C would be normalized if it's multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) for each component.

Wait, no. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but in our case, the second component is (cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2)), not sin(theta/2). So that doesn't match.

Option D: sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2). Hmm, but our psi_1 is 1/sqrt(2), which is like sqrt(1/2), but these options have different coefficients.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization. Let me re-examine. Since our n is in the x-z plane, it can be written as (n_x, 0, n_z) where n_x² + n_z² =1.

We used n_x = cosθ, n_z= sinθ. But that's an assumption, perhaps the parameterization could vary. Wait, but in any case, the eigenvector components depend on theta, the angle of n in the x-z plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved in terms of the direction of n, expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), which is another common parameterization where theta is the angle from the z-axis. Let me see.

Wait, if I parameterize n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), then n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Let me try that approach again.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Then, substituting into the earlier equations.

Wait, let's go back to the earlier equations without parameterizing.

The eigenvector equation is:

n_z ψ_1 + n_x ψ_2 = ψ_1
n_x ψ_1 - n_z ψ_2 = ψ_2

Which can be rewritten as:

(n_z -1) ψ_1 + n_x ψ_2 = 0
n_x ψ_1 + ( -n_z -1 ) ψ_2 = 0

Wait, second equation: n_x ψ_1 -n_z ψ_2 = ψ_2 → n_x ψ_1 = (n_z +1) ψ_2 → ψ_1 = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] ψ_2.

Substituting into the first equation:

(n_z -1) [ (n_z +1)/n_x ψ_2 ] + n_x ψ_2 = 0 → [ (n_z^2 -1)/n_x + n_x ] ψ_2 = 0.

Which simplifies to [ (n_z^2 -1 + n_x^2 ) / n_x ] ψ_2 = 0.

Since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, n_z^2 =1 -n_x^2.

So, ( (1 -n_x^2) -1 +n_x^2 ) /n_x → 0.

Therefore, 0 =0, which is always true. So, the eigenvector is given by ψ_1 = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] ψ_2.

Hmm.

Let me set ψ_2 =1, then ψ_1 = (n_z +1)/n_x.

But then normalization: |ψ_1|^2 + |ψ_2|^2 = [ (n_z +1)^2 / n_x^2 ] +1 = [ (n_z +1)^2 + n_x^2 ] / n_x^2.

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, so expanding numerator:

n_z^2 + 2n_z +1 + n_x^2 = (n_x^2 +n_z^2) + 2n_z +1 = 1 + 2n_z +1 = 2(1 +n_z).

So normalization becomes [ 2(1 +n_z) ] / n_x^2 =1.

So,

sqrt(2(1 +n_z)) / |n_x| =1.

But n_x = sinθ if theta is the angle from z-axis. Wait, earlier I had n_x=cosθ, but perhaps that's a different parameterization.

Wait, let me think. If n is in the x-z plane, and I'm parameterizing it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), then theta would be the angle from the z-axis, which is the standard approach. So, n_x= sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

Let me try substituting that.

n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

So,

ψ_1 = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * ψ_2.

Let me set ψ_2= A, so ψ_1= [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ] A.

Then, normalization:

|ψ_1|^2 + |ψ_2|^2 = [ (1 + cosθ)^2 / sin^2θ + 1 ] |A|^2 =1.

Compute the expression inside:

( (1 + 2 cosθ + cos^2θ) + sin^2θ ) / sin^2θ

= [ 1 + 2 cosθ + (cos^2θ + sin^2θ) ] / sin^2θ

= [ 2 + 2 cosθ ] / sin^2θ

= 2(1 + cosθ) / sin^2θ.

So,

|A|^2 * [ 2(1 + cosθ) / sin^2θ ] =1 → |A|^2 = sin^2θ / [ 2(1 + cosθ) ]

= [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ] / [ 2 (1 + cosθ) ) ]

= (1 - cosθ)/2.

So,

A = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sin(theta/2), since 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2).

So, ψ_2 = sin(theta/2)
ψ_1 = [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ] * sin(theta/2 )

Wait, 1 + cosθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

(1 + cosθ)/ sinθ = [2 cos²(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ]

So,

ψ_1 = [ cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2 )

Thus, ψ_1 = cos(theta/2)
ψ_2 = sin(theta/2 )

But wait, normalization: |cos(theta/2)|^2 + |sin(theta/2)|^2 =1, which holds.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is the same as option C.

But wait, the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which matches option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the options were given as:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ)
B) (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ)
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but the question says the operator is for a muon, but the eigenvector is a vector of complex numbers (since spinors can be complex), so perhaps the answer includes phases. But in this case, the eigenvector we found is real, so option C is correct.

Wait, but why does option C not have any normalization factors? Because the way we parameterized, the vector is already normalized.

Yes, because cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) =1, so it's normalized. So option C is correct.

So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given in terms of $2 \times 2$ matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Projection**: The component of $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
   \[
   P_n = \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
   \]
   Substituting the given components of $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, and using $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, the matrix representation of $P_n$ becomes:
   \[
   P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
   \sin\theta & -\cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation for $P_n$ is:
   \[
   P_n | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle
   \]
   Substituting the matrix for $P_n$, this leads to the system of equations:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)\psi_1 + \sin\theta \psi_2 = 0, \quad \sin\theta \psi_1 + (-\cos\theta - 1)\psi_2 = 0
   \]

3. **Solving for Eigenvector**: From the equations, the eigenvector components are related by:
   \[
   \psi_1 = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} \psi_2
   \]
   Substituting $\psi_2 = \sin(\theta/2)$ (from normalization), we find:
   \[
   \psi_1 = \cos(\theta/2), \quad \psi_2 = \sin(\theta/2)
   \]

4. **Normalization**: The eigenvector is normalized as:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos(\theta/2) \\
   \sin(\theta/2)
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   since $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and incorrect coefficients.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This is not consistent with the derived eigenvector, as it uses $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$ and introduces an arbitrary phase $\phi$.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived eigenvector exactly and is normalized.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This introduces incorrect normalization factors and unnecessary factors of $\hbar$.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
