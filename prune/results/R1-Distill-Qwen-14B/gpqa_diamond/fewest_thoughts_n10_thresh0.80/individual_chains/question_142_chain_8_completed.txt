Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about the density matrix. Hmm, the question gives me a density matrix ρ, and I need to find its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are given as points in some space, like r=(1,1,0) or r=(0,0,1), etc.

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. A pure state would be a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But this ρ isn't that; it looks like it's a combination of two projectors. Let me write it out.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh, right, that's the density matrix for a completely mixed state in a single qubit. Because each term is an orthogonal projector, and the coefficients are 1/2 each. So this state is maximally mixed.

I think I remember something about the Bloch sphere representation for qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector on the Bloch sphere and σ are the Pauli matrices. But wait, for a mixed state, especially this maximally mixed one, it's different.

Right, the maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, which should be at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Because in the Bloch sphere representation, the origin corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is (I)/2 in this case. Because if you think about it, I is the identity matrix, so I/2 is (|0><0| + |1><1| + |0><1| + |1><0| ) / 2. But wait, our given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1| )/2. Oh wait no, that's only the diagonal terms. So in terms of the Bloch vector, the off-diagonal terms are zero, which implies that the vector r is (0,0,0). Because the general form is (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z ) / 2. So if there are no σ_x, σ_y, or σ_z terms, then x=y=z=0.

So the vector r would be (0,0,0). Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The maximally mixed state is when the qubit is in a completely unknown state, which is represented by the center of the Bloch sphere. So yeah, r is zero. So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can generally be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms correspond to equal probabilities for the states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \). This implies that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) has components \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 0 \), as there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x \), \( \sigma_y \), or \( \sigma_z \). 

The maximally mixed state is represented by the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). Among the given options, this matches option C.

Answer: C
