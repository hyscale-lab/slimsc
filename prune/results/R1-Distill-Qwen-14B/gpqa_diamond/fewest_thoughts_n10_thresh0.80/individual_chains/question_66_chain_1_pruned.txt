Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT question. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. I remember that effective field theories are used when you have a high energy scale physics that's not accessible, so you just write down all possible interactions consistent with some symmetry. 

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, let me think about what each symmetry is. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in different inertial frames, right? And Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations in space and time. So if Poincare is a symmetry, then Lorentz must be too because it's part of it. But wait, in SMEFT, do they require Poincare symmetry?

Wait, wait, I'm a bit fuzzy. In the Standard Model, we have Poincare symmetry. SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the SM, but it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators that are consistent with the SM's symmetries. So, the SMEFT operators have to respect the same symmetries as the SM. 

What's the SM's symmetry? The SM has Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations. Also, it has gauge symmetries, like SU(2), SU(3), etc., but that's not part of the question here.

So, looking at the options, if the SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry, that includes Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are required. But wait, looking at the answer options, one of them has 1 and 2 (option A is 1 and 2), another has 1,2,4 (option C). Hmm, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the symmetries. SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because the operators are written in a way that they have the same Lorentz structure as the SM. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. But in effective theories, sometimes you have operators that are nonrenormalizable, but they still should be local, so they should respect Poincare. Because if they didn't, that would suggest non-local interactions, which is
