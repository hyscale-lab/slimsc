Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—standard and chiral.

Hmm, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is used for epoxidation. Epoxidation of alkenes typically forms an epoxide. But wait, does the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affect the epoxide's formation?

Wait, mCPBA is a peracid and adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the alkene's configuration. For an (E) or trans double bond, the epoxide would form with a certain stereochemistry, and similarly for (Z) or cis. But when the reaction is done, what happens after that?

Oh right, after epoxidation, if you treat with aqueous acid, you get acid-catalyzed ring opening. The epoxide ring opens, and what's the product? I think the ring opening leads to the formation of a diol. Let me think—the mechanism. The acid would protonate the epoxide oxygen, making a better leaving group. Then water attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more electrophilic. But wait, it's a cyclic transition state. So for each epoxide, the diol would form in a certain way.

But wait, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z). Let's consider each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA. (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it will form an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene. For (E) alkenes, the epoxide groups would be trans, right? Because the peracid adds across the double bond with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. Wait no, mCPBA adds in a way that the oxygen adds to each carbon, and
