Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that scattering amplitude has something to do with partial waves and phase shifts. 

Wait, the question gives me phase shifts for different l values, right? The phase shifts are delta_0, delta_1, delta_2, delta_3, and delta_4. The values are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Oh, and the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond these. So I guess I only consider l=0 to l=4.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) in terms of phase shifts is something like a sum over l of (2l+1)/(2i) * e^{2i delta_l} * (sin delta_l). Wait, no, wait. Let me recall. Oh right, the partial wave expansion says that the scattering amplitude f is a sum over l of ( (2l+1)/(2i) ) * e^{2i delta_l} * ( sin(delta_l) ) * P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, when θ is zero, which is along the incident beam direction, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1), because cos(0) is 1. 

Ah, right! So at θ=0, P_l(1) is
