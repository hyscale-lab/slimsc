Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. So, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

Hmm, so the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, right? So, N = k / (parallax)^5, where k is some constant. Parallax is usually denoted by 'plx' in some contexts, so N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh yes, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1 / r, where r is the distance. Or wait, I think it's more precise to say plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 parsec divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/r, with r in parsecs.

So if plx = 1/r, then plx is inversely proportional to r. So, if I substitute plx in terms of r into the equation for N, I can express N in terms of r.

Let me write that down. Since N ∝ 1/plx^5, substituting plx = 1/r gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that.

1/( (1/r)^5 ) equals r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but wait a second. That would mean as distance r increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of r. But that doesn't make much sense, because in reality, the number of stars you can see should decrease with distance, right? Because stars are fainter and farther away. So maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh, wait, the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5, which is (1/r)^5. So 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. Hmm, that suggests that as r increases, N increases as r^5. But that's counterintuitive. Because as you look further away, you wouldn't expect more stars in a unit volume. Or perhaps the question is considering the number of stars in some specific region, but the way it's worded is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says: "how does the number of stars in
