Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if the parallax (plx) is small, the star is far away, and if plx is large, the star is nearby.

The formula given is like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But wait, how does parallax relate to distance? Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That means d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to d.

So if I want to express the number of stars N in terms of distance d, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Let's see: N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is the same as (1/(1/d))^5. Oh wait, that's (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. Hmm, but wait, does that make sense? Because higher d means more stars? Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, more stars would mean that as you go to larger distances, you're actually looking into a larger volume, but the density of stars might be decreasing. But the question says the number varies as 1/plx^5, which when converted to d is d^5. So the number of stars
