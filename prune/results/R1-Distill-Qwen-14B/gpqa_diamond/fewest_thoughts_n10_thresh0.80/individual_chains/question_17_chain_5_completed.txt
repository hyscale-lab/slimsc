Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The question says there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to calcium ions. The problem gives me the formation constant, K_ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. And I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the formation constant (K) for a complex ion like Ca-EDTA is related to the concentrations of the ions involved. The formula, I think, is K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, the EDTA in solution can exist in different protonated forms, right? But the question says the pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution is buffered such that all the EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca²+ effectively. So I don't have to worry about the different protonation states of EDTA here. That's good because it simplifies things.

The concentration given is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote that as [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. Since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio (one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-), the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA. So the formation constant K is given for this reaction.

So, the expression for K is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, how do I relate this to the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA? Well, I think I need to express [EDTA^4-] in terms of [Ca²+], assuming that all the EDTA is either free or bound to Ca²+.

Assuming that the solution is such that the initial concentration of EDTA is only from the dissociation of the complex. Wait, no, because when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and initially, without any dissociation, the EDTA would all be in the complex. But in reality, some of it dissociates.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, I think the initial assumption is that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can ignore any contribution from the dissociation because K is very large. Wait, no, the K is large, which means the complex is stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the [Ca²+] would be very small.

Wait, let me think again. The formation constant is very large (5e10), which implies that the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So the concentrations of the free ions (Ca²+ and EDTA^4-) would be very low.

So, the setup would be:

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x, where x is the amount that dissociates. But wait, since K is so large, x would be very small compared to 0.02, so [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M.

So x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates, which is [Ca²+] = x. Similarly, [EDTA^4-] would also be x, because for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, substituting into the K expression: K = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that equation:

0.02 / (x²) = 5e10

So, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Taking the square root: x = sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7 M.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / (5e10) is (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Ah, wait! Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, correct. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of that is sqrt(4) * 10^(-13/2) ) → 2 * 10^(-6.5). Which is 2e-6.5. Wait 10^-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So K = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA] ) = 5e10.

Assuming [CaEDTA] is approx 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = [EDTA] = x.

So,

5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.3e-7, so option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium expression for the dissociation of the complex is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\), and assuming the pH is ideal (all EDTA is in the form \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\)), we let \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
