Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see, it's about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges depends on their charges and the distances between them. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And all these charges are in an isolated system, which probably means I don't have to worry about external fields or anything like that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, point P has one charge, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. So the setup is like a central charge with twelve others arranged around it, each 2m away.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy of this system. Hmm. I think the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So I need to calculate all the pairwise interactions.

But wait, since the system is isolated, the energy is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair. So I'll need to compute that.

Each charge is 2e, so the charge of each is 2 * elementary charge. Elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Wait, but in potential energy calculations, the formula is U = k * (q1*q2)/r. Right, where k is Coulomb's constant, about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So for each pair, I calculate the potential energy and sum them all up.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 has a distance of 2 m from the central charge.

So the first part would be the potential energy between the central charge (charge 2e) and each of the twelve surrounding charges (each also 2e). So for each of those 12, the potential energy is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Wait, but wait, is it
