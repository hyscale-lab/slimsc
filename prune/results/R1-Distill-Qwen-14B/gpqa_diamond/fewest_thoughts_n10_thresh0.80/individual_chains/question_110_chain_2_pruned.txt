Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But each has its own limitations, especially regarding the brightness of the stars they can observe. The question gives me some specifics: ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. Wait, no, wait, wait. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17? Or wait, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, no, wait: when something is brighter, its magnitude is lower. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means any star with V mag less than 17 is detectable. Because, like, the lower the magnitude, the brighter the object. So for example, a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17, so it's observable by both.

So, the key is to find stars whose apparent V magnitudes are ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). Because a star that's brighter than 17 mag in apparent V would be visible by both, but for HIRES, it needs to be brighter than 16. So wait, no: the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (since ESPRESSO can't see fainter than that) and ≤16 (since HIRES can't see fainter than that). So to be detectable by both, the apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag. Because if a star is at, say, 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So the star must be brighter than 17 mag can't be seen by ESPRESSO if it's 17. Wait, no, the question says with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh wait, so that
