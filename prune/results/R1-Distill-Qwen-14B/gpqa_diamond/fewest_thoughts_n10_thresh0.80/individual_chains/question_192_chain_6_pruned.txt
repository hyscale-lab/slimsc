Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s from the conductor's center. The cavity has radius r, and since r is less than R, it's entirely within the conductor. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A to D, each with different expressions involving these variables.

I think I should recall how charges distribute in such a setup. Since the conductor is uncharged, but a charge is placed inside the cavity, I remember that the charges will redistribute. Wait, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface. But initially, the conductor is neutral, so when a charge is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must induce an opposite charge. Oh, right, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge +q to balance.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the net charge on the conductor remains zero.

Now, the electric field outside a conductor (in the region beyond its surface) is determined only by the total charge enclosed within. So the field outside (like at point P) should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside should be like that of a point charge +q at the center. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), right? Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(
