Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r with its center separated by distance s from the conductor's center. So s is the distance between the two centers. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, this is a problem involving conductors and electric fields. I remember that in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves in a certain way. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, but has a charge +q inside the cavity, I think that the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge.

Oh right, when a conductor encloses a charge, the inner surface induces an opposite charge. So since the charge inside is +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must then have +q. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, the inner surface has -q and the outer +q to balance.

But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so when you put +q inside, the conductor must have an induced charge. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface that includes P. But wait, conductors in electrostatic equilibrium have the electric field inside the conductor material (between inner and outer surfaces) equal to zero. So for points outside the conductor, the field would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the +q were at the center of the conductor. So using Gauss's law, for a point outside (L > R), the
