Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz, right? So mu = γ S_z, I think. 

The setup is that initially, the magnetic field is pointing along the +Z direction. So the magnetic field B is along Z. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the magnetic field switches from Z to Y, same strength. 

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. And the options are various multiples involving gamma, B, and square roots.

Wait, so the system undergoes a change in the magnetic field direction. Initially, the particle is in a state aligned with the Z field, so its spin is along Z. Then the field changes direction to Y. Since the field changes suddenly, the state of the particle doesn't change instantaneously, right? So the wavefunction remains the same, but the Hamiltonian does.

Let me think about the initial state. The particle's spin is aligned with the initial magnetic field (along Z), so the state is probably a spin-up state in the Z basis. So that's |↑z⟩. 

But when the magnetic field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field. The energy is given by H = -μ·B, but since mu is gamma S_z, and B is along Y, maybe I should think about the new Hamiltonian.

Wait, wait, mu is gamma S_z, and the new B is along Y, so the interaction is H = -mu · B. But wait, mu is a vector, so it's the dot product. So H would be proportional to S_z multiplied by B in the Y direction. Wait, no, let me think again. Oh, because B is along Y, the direction vector is (0, B, 0). So the dot product mu · B would be (gamma S_z) · (0, B, 0) ? Wait, no, because S_z is the component in the z-direction, so the dot product would actually be zero if the magnetic moment is along z and the field is along y. Because S_z is along z, the dot product with B (along y) is zero. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps mu is the magnetic moment vector, which is gamma times the spin vector S. So mu = γ S. So when B is along Y, the interaction energy is H = -μ · B = -γ (S · B). Since B is in the Y direction, B = (0, B, 0) (assuming standard axes), so S · B is S_y multiplied by B in the y-direction. So H = -γ B S_y. 

Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma S_z. Oh wait, the question says mu is equal to gamma S_z. So mu is not the vector but the z-component of the magnetic moment. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read the question again.

"mu (= gamma*S
