Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it. Hmm. The setup is that a scientist is trying to make a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in serial dilutions, running three technical replicates each time. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means it's perfect—so the reaction is working as expected. The R² is 1, which is a perfect correlation, so the data fits the curve really well. The slope is -3.3, which I remember has something to do with the efficiency and the calculation of the curve.

Looking at the results, the Ct values go down as the concentration goes up. That makes sense because higher concentrations should reach the threshold faster, meaning lower Ct values. For example, at 100000 copies, the Ct is around 34, and it drops to 20-something at 10 copies. That seems right.

But the question is about the discrepancies in his results. Wait, what's the issue? The options suggest something's wrong with the data or the setup.

Let me look at the options. Option A says qPCR can't be used for quantification. But that doesn't make sense because the R² is perfect, and he's using a calibration curve. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says Ct values aren't in agreement with target nucleic acid. But his data shows a clear, linear relationship. Each dilution step (10x) leads to a decrease in Ct of about 3.3 cycles. Wait, because the slope is -3.3. Let's think about the formula. The standard formula is Ct = (slope * log(concentration)) + intercept. Oh, but wait, if the efficiency is 100%, which is 1, then the slope should be -3.3219, which is approximately -3.3. That's because log2(10) is about 3.3219. So each 10-fold dilution should decrease Ct by about 3.3 cycles. Let me check the data.

At 100000 to 10000, the Ct goes from 33.9 to 30.6. The difference is 3.3. Then 10000 to 1000: 30.6 to 27.3. Again, 3.3. 1000 to 100: 27.3 to 24.0. Oh wait, 3.3. Then 100 to 10: 24.0 to 20.7. Also a 3.3 drop. So each 10x dilution gives a 3.3 drop in Ct. So that's exactly what we expect. So why are the options suggesting a discrepancy?

Wait, the question says "discrepancies in his results." Looking at the data, each concentration's Ct varies a bit because of the technical
