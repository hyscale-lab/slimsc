Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are labeled A to D. Hmm.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, the formula is density = mass/volume. Volume for a sphere is (4/3)πr³, but maybe I don't need to calculate the exact volume for each. Maybe I can compare their densities based on mass and radius ratios.

Let me look at each option:

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet would have a density of 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. The question says this planet's density is about 5.5, so that's a given. But wait, the question is about which has the highest, so if option b is 5.5 and a is also 5.5, but wait, no, option a is Earth's, which is 5.5, so I'm confused. But wait, option b's density is given as 5.5, which is the same as Earth's. So maybe they are the same, but I'll have to check the other options.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Since it's the same composition, the density should be the same as Earth's. Because density is mass over volume, but if both mass and radius scale together, the density remains the same. Wait, but composition affects density. If it's same composition, then density is same, right? Because Earth's density is based on its composition. So if the mass is 5 times Earth's, but radius increases as well, but the density is the same. So c's density is 5.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose Earth's mass is M, radius R. Then, option c is 5M, same composition. So density is (5M)/( (4/3)π(R')³). But since it's same composition, the density is same. So R
