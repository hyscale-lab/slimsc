Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me think about what I know. Li with 3 neutrons means it's lithium-6, right? Because lithium has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons would make the mass number 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with energies at relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic energy equations. The energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula for total energy is gamma times the rest energy, E = γmc². But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy. Or maybe it's the total energy. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, no, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", and RHIC accelerates ions to a certain kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes in these contexts, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I think I should double-check that. Oh, but the problem states that the speed is 0.96c, which is pretty high. So I need to find the energy, which could be the kinetic energy or the total energy.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think they're referring to the kinetic energy, because the speed being a significant fraction of c implies relativistic effects, so the kinetic energy would be a significant portion of the total energy.

But maybe I should just calculate both and see which one fits the options. Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the total energy. Let me think about the approach.

The steps I need to take probably involve finding the Lorentz factor gamma, then either calculating the total energy or the kinetic energy.

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.96c. Plugging that in.

So let's compute gamma. Let me calculate that. 

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96^2 is 0.9216, yes. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly? Because 0.
