Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying amounts of hydrogen and oxygen. I'll need to use the information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to determine which one it is.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the problem mentions a broad peak, which might suggest it's not a simple alcohol because those can sometimes be less broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group in something else, like a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1650 peak might be another functional group. If there's a C=C double bond, that's usually around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹. So maybe this is a conjugated system, like an enone or something with both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. That means there are hydrogens on a double bond. So the compound has a conjugated double bond, perhaps next to a carbonyl. Like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl system, which I think is common in structures like esters or ketones with adjacent double bonds.

Looking at the Mass Spec data: there's a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm trying to remember what gives a 45 peak. Common fragments include an ethyl group (m/z=29), but 45 is a bit higher. Maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 could be the fragment with a CH3O group (like in an ester cleavage) or perhaps a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a CO group losing something. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this part yet.

Now, let's think about the possible structures for each formula.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

I need to figure out which formula fits the spectroscopic data.

Let's go back to the functional groups. The FTIR has O-H (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700), and another peak at 1650 which might be a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the IR peaks: 1700 is a strong carbonyl, and 1650 is maybe another carbonyl or a conjugated double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a C=C if it's lower than 1700. But in any case, the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond with adjacent Hs. So the structure has a conjugated system, like an enone.

Let me think about the possible structures. For a six-carbon compound, maybe something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. For example, something like methyl vinyl ketone but with more carbons. Or maybe an ester like ethyl acrylate.

Wait, but let's think about the molecular formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: for C6H12O2, the formula is CnH2mOx. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n +2 - m - x*2)/2. Wait, let's calculate:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 2*2)/2 = (14-12-4)/2 → ( -2)/2 → -1. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I did that wrong. Alternative formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here, it's (2*6 +2 -12 - 0)/2 → (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That would mean a ring or a double bond. But wait, earlier we thought there were a double bond and a carbonyl. Hmm, that's two DoU. So maybe this formula isn't enough.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. For C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - (O?)) Wait, no. DoU is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is halogens, which we don't have. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. Hmm, so only one DoU. But the compound has a carbonyl (which is a double bond) and another double bond (since the NMR shows vinyl Hs). That would require two DoU. So maybe this formula isn't possible? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me compute the molecular formula for each option and see their DoU.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular formula is C6H12O2. General formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2Ox. So for n=6, without any rings or double bonds, it would be C6H14O2. So the given compound has 2 less hydrogens, which implies one ring or double bond. But the compound has a carbonyl (that's one double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond). So that would be two DoU. So C6H12O2 would have 1 DoU, but the structure requires 2 DoU. So perhaps this formula isn't matching.

Wait, maybe the oxygen affects the calculation. No, the DoU formula doesn't consider O, X, or N beyond the H count. So each O doesn't add a DoU.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as C6H12O2. The formula for an ester is usually (R-O-CO-R'). Let's see: if it's an ester, like methyl vinyl something, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but that might complicate things.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could mean one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds. If the structure has a carbonyl (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), that fits. So this could be possible.

But the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests an -OH group. So maybe it's an alcohol with a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe a ketone with a double bond and an -OH group. But wait, the formula for B is C6H10O, so that has one O. So the functional groups would have to be either a carbonyl (like ketone or aldehyde) plus a double bond and an -OH? Or perhaps an ester, but that requires two O's.

Wait, if the formula is C6H10O, it can't have two O-containing groups because that would require more O's. So maybe an alcohol with a carbonyl and a double bond. But how would that work? For example, something like cyclohexanone with a double bond and an -OH. But that would require more O's unless the O is part of a carbonyl and the alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe it's an enol. Enols have a double bond adjacent to an -OH. Enols would have a carbonyl (from the keto form), but the IR would show a broad peak for the -OH, which matches. Also, the NMR would show vinyl Hs. So maybe this is an enol. But wait, enols can tautomerize to ketones, so perhaps the IR would show a carbonyl as well. Let me think: in the IR, a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (for -OH), and peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 could be the carbonyl (from the keto form), and 1650 could be the C=C in the enol form. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is the C=C in a conjugated system.

So for option B (C6H10O), perhaps it's an enol with a conjugated double bond. The DoU would be two, which fits.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14 -10)/2=
