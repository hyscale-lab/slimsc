Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different formulas: all are C6H with varying O and H counts. The options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests O-H stretching, probably from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol. But the presence of a broad peak usually is more indicative of a carboxylic acid because their O-H is more acidic and tends to have a broader and stronger absorption. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group like in a phenol, but phenols also have broad O-H stretches.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong peak that often corresponds to either a carbonyl (C=O) group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Or maybe an amide, but since the options don't include N, probably not. Wait, if it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with some conjugation, or maybe an ester. Alternatively, maybe one peak is the C=O and the other is C=C.

Wait, but 1700 is C=O, and 1650 could be another C=O, but that's a bit low. Wait, more likely, maybe the 1650 is due to conjugation. Like maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, another possibility is that the 1650 is from an aromatic C=C stretch. For example, benzene rings usually have C=C around 1450-1600 cm-1, but if it's in a conjugated system with something else, like a carbonyl, it could be higher. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring?

Wait, but the 1650 cm-1 peak could also be from an ester, but I think esters have their C=O around 1700-1750, maybe a bit lower if conjugated. Alternatively, if there's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone, maybe the other peak is from a double bond elsewhere.

But wait, another thought: maybe the 1650 is an amide's N-H bend, but I don't think so because that's usually around 1500-1600. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from a C=C in an aromatic ring or an alkene. If the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that would support the presence of a double bond, like an alkene or an aromatic ring. So considering the NMR data, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which means the molecule has a double bond, like an alkene (vinyl groups) or an aromatic ring.

So putting this together: FTIR shows a broad O-H (maybe a carboxylic acid or alcohol), a carbonyl at 1700 (maybe ester, ketone, aldehyde, acid), and another peak at 1650 which could be an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond.

Now looking at the NMR data: vinyl hydrogens, which are protons on a double bond (like in an alkene or aromatic ring). So the molecule has a double bond.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. The molecular ion would have a certain mass, but the fragment at 45 is a key clue. Let me think about possible fragments that give m/z 45. 45 is the molecular weight of (maybe) (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's a small molecule). Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl fragment. Wait, 45 could also be from a (CH2) group with some oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's the mass of a fragment like CH2O (30), but 45 is higher. Alternatively, maybe C3H7O? Hmm. Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, etc. Let's think about the possible molecular weight.

Wait, but the fragment is at m/z 45. Let me think of possible functional groups. For example, a fragment with a carbonyl might lose certain groups. Maybe the molecule has an ester group? Because esters can break into smaller fragments. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Or maybe a beta-keto ester, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -12 -2*2)/2 = (14-16)/2= (-2/2)= -1? Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, so (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation: could be
