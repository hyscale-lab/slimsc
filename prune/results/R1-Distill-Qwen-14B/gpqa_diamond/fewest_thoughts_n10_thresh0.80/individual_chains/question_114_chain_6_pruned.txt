Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find out which reagents (A and B) are suitable for each step. The options are A, B, C, D with different combinations.

First, let's look at the reactions.

The first reaction is:
butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? Adding NaCN... wait, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is probably the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. So, the reaction of a ketone with CN- (from NaCN) under acidic conditions typically gives a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but for that, you usually need an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or similar. So in this case, A is probably H3O+ because it's the acid that protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks.

So the first part, reagent A is H3O+ maybe.

Looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+, option B also A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm.

The second reaction is:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, what's happening here? The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxy group. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) under certain conditions.

I think that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For conversion to a carboxylic acid, I think it's usually done with strong acid and heat. Alternatively, maybe using a strong acid catalyst.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O. So probably, it's a hydrolysis reaction. The nitrile group (-CN) in the presence of water and acid would undergo hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the reaction is adding B, which is H2O, so the catalyst for the hydrolysis would be acid. So for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, you typically use H3O+ as the catalyst, but other strong acids might work too.

Wait, but the options for B are HCl and CH3COOH. Let me think.

Another possibility: sometimes, nitrile hydrolysis can be done using a mixture of HCl and water, which would provide the acidic conditions needed. Alternatively, maybe using a weaker acid but with a longer time. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis is likely under acidic conditions. For nitrile → carboxylic
