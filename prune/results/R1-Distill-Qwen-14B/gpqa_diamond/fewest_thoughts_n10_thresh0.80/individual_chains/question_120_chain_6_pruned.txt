Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax has something to do with distance. Right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question is asking about the number of stars per unit change in parallax (dN/dplx, maybe?). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means the number density is constant in space. So, in a given volume, there's the same number of stars.

Wait, how does parallax relate to distance? Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is 1/distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/d. So, distance d = 1/plx.

So if I consider a thin shell at a distance d, the thickness would be delta_d. The volume of that shell would be 4π d² delta_d. Since the stars are uniform, the number of stars in that shell should be proportional to the volume. So N = n * 4π d² delta_d, where n is the number density.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Let's substitute d = 1/plx. So d² is (1/plx)^2. Also, delta_d is the change in distance, which would relate to the change in parallax. Let's think about how delta_d relates to delta_plx.

Differentiating d = 1/plx, so delta_d ≈ - (1/plx²) delta_plx. Hmm, but since we're looking at a small change, maybe we can take the magnitude. So delta_d is approximately (1/plx²) delta_plx.

So substituting back into N: N = n * 4π (1/plx²)² * (1/plx²) delta_plx. Wait, let me make sure. Wait, the shell's volume is 4π d² delta_d. So when d is 1/plx, d^2 is 1/plx². And delta_d is (delta_plx)/(plx²). Because, delta_d = (delta (1/plx)) ≈ - (1/plx²) delta_plx. Taking the absolute value, delta_d = delta_plx / (plx²).

So substituting everything, N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (delta_plx / plx²) ). Wait, that's N = n * 4π (delta_plx) / (plx^4).

So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dN/dplx) would be n *4π / plx^4. So the number decreases as plx^(-4). So the trend is 1/(plx^4).

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the number of stars per unit volume is constant. The volume element in terms of parallax. Oh, maybe using a different approach.

Alternatively, think in terms of how many stars are within a certain range of parallax. The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to the volume between those distances. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, the volume per unit plx would change accordingly.

Wait, let's see. The distance d is 1/plx. So the range of distance between plx and plx + dplx is from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). But for small dplx, this can be approximated. Let's think in terms of a thin shell.

The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. But since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the shell's volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) ) dplx. So 4π d^2 dd = 4π (1/plx^2) (d d plx / plx^2) ). Wait, no, because d is 1/plx, so dd is ( -1/plx^2 ) dplx. So substituting, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d plx / (plx^2)). Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^2) * (d d plx) / (plx^2) ) = 4π (d d plx) / plx^4.

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, dN = n * dN/dV * dV. So dN = n * 4π (d d plx) / plx^4. So the number per unit dplx is dN/d dplx = n *4π / plx^4. So again, the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the
