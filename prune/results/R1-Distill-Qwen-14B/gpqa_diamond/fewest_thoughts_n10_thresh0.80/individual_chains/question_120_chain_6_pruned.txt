Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I need to think this through.

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about parallax. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star relative to more distant stars when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So, a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

Wait, the formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx. Oh right, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So bigger plx means closer star.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if I consider a small change in parallax, say dplx, how does the number of stars in that range relate to plx?

I think this has to do with the volume of space between certain distances. Because stars are spread out in space, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on how much volume there is. But the question states that stars are uniformly distributed, so the number density is constant.

So the number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. The volume between two spheres (say, radius d and d + dd) is 4πd² dd, right? Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between d and d+dd would be approximately 4πd² dd for small dd.

But since the parallax is plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, if we have a change in plx, dplx, how does that relate to dd? Let's see. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense.

Wait, but when considering a range in plx, like from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance? Let's think: if plx is small, d is large, so a small change in plx (like dplx) corresponds to a larger change in d. Because d = 1/plx, so as plx approaches zero, d becomes very large, and any small change in plx affects d more. So the volume between two distances is proportional to d² dd, which in terms of plx would be?

Let me try to substitute. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with absolute numbers, maybe I can ignore the negative sign. So the volume element is 4π d² dd, which is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, the volume element in terms of parallax: since d = 1/plx, and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx, so the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx^2) ) * something? Wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. Let's compute it step by step.

The volume between two spheres of radius d and d + dd is V = 4π (d + dd)^3 - 4π d³ ≈ 4π (3d² dd) ) when dd is small. So V ≈ 4π (3d² dd) = 12 π d² dd.

But I can express V in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = ( -1/plx² ) dplx. So, substituting:

V ≈ 12 π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( (-1/plx²) dplx ) )

Wait, but since dplx is a positive change in plx (we can take absolute values for the number of stars), the volume
