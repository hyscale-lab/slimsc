Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about atomic nuclei fission. Hmm, I remember that when a nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and each of these fragments moves away with some kinetic energy. The question is about finding the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Let me read the problem again. The initial nucleus has a rest mass M and rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. So, E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV. Then, it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, the masses of the two fragments are 0.99M in total.

Wait, but the initial mass was M. So, the total rest mass after fission is less than before. That makes sense because some energy is released as kinetic energy and other forms.

Let me denote the masses. Let the smaller fragment have mass m, the larger one 2m. So, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Wait, because 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

But wait, the problem states that the sum is 99% of M, so 3m = 0.99 M. So, that's correct.

Now, the nucleus was initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. So, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. The initial energy is all rest mass energy, 300 GeV. The final energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the fragments' momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, let's denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 (for the more massive one, 2m) and v2 (for the less massive one, m). But I think it's easier to work with relativistic equations here.

Wait, because when velocities are significant fractions of c, we can't use classical mechanics. So the problem is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation.

So, I need to compute T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, using both methods and then find the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic calculations. So, I need to calculate both and subtract.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute the rest masses of the two fragments: m and 2m, sum is 0.99 M.

2. Since the initial momentum is zero, the fragments' momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

3. Use conservation of energy to find their kinetic energies.

4. Compute
