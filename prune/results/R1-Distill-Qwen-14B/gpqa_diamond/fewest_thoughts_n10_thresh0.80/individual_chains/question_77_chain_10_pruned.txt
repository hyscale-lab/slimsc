Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but let's try to think this through. 

The question has two parts: the first is a Cope rearrangement of (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methylbenzene, and the second is a Cope rearrangement (indicated by heat) of a more complex molecule, leading to product B. I need to figure out the major products A and B from these reactions.

Starting with part A. The molecule is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. Let me draw its structure. The benzene ring has a substituent attached. The substituent is a CH2-O- group, where the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. 

So the structure is benzene with a -CH2-O-CH2-C(CH2)(CH3)=CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let me think. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a substituent on the 3rd carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the 1-yl is where the substituent is at the first carbon. So but-2-en-1-yl: it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be: the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the substituent is at C1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's but-1-en-4-yl perhaps? Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

But-2-en-1-yl: the substituent is on C1. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, but that would make the double bond
