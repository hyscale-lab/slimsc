Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about how the number of stars varies with distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' or 'plx', right? So the relationship given is N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. Or in other words, N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant.

I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. Or wait, plx is in arcseconds, and in parsecs, the formula is r = 1/plx. So plx = 1/r. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

So if plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So substituting that into the expression for N, which is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, we can express everything in terms of r.

Let's see, 1/(plx)^5 = (1/plx)^5 = (r)^5. Because plx is 1/r, so 1/plx is r. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so maybe they're referring to the number density, like the number per unit volume or something?

Wait, actually, maybe I should think about the differential here. Because the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be proportional to N dr, but in this case, the question is about the number per unit range of distance, so perhaps it's the differential number, dN/dr, which is the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, but let's go back. N is the number of stars in a region, and it varies as 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting, N is proportional to r^5. So N = k*r^5.

If we're looking at how the number changes with distance, say, per unit distance, we can take the derivative of N with respect to r. So dN/dr = 5k r^4. That would mean the rate at which the number of stars increases with distance is proportional to r^4. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range). So I think the correct approach is to find how N depends on r, not the derivative. Because N is given as a function of plx, which is a function of r.

Wait, maybe the question is about the number per unit volume or per unit distance? No, the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a given volume is related to the density. But in this case, the problem states that the total number of stars varies with 1
