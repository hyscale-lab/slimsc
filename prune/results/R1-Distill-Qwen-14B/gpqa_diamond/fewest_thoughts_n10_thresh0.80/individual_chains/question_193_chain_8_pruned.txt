Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about how the number of stars varies with distance, given that it varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so maybe I need to connect those concepts.

Wait, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, the formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if the parallax is small, the distance is large, and vice versa. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

The question states that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. So 1/(plx) is d, so 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Because plx is 1/d, 1/(plx^5) = (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. So the number of stars as a function of distance. So for each small increment in distance, how does the number change?

Wait, I think this is about the distribution of stars in space. If the number of stars you can see increases as you go closer, but perhaps decreases as you go further because there aren't as many. But the exact relation here depends on the given proportionality.

So from earlier, N ∝ d^5. So for a given range of distance, say from d to d + dr, the number of stars in that shell would be the change in N. But wait, no, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, which I think refers to the number per unit distance. So maybe I should think about dN/dr.

Wait, let's define it more clearly. Let's say the number of stars as a function of distance is N(d) = k * d^5, where k is a proportionality constant. Then the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be the derivative of N with respect to d. The derivative of d^5 is 5d^4, so dN/dr = 5k d^4.
