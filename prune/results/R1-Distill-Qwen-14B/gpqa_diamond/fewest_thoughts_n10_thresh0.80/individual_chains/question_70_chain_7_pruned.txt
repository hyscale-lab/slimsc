Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and see if I can figure out what's going on.

So, the question is about some reactions and then determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D with different symmetry groups.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents—that's a lot. I remember that in some reactions, metals react with halogens, like sodium reacting with chlorine gas. But sodium is a solid and Cl2 is a gas. But sodium chloride forms in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe it's another kind of reaction. Oh! I think of the reaction where a metal oxide reacts with a halogen. Or wait, maybe a transition metal reacting with something else.

Wait, bright red product C. That makes me think of something like silver chloride? No, silver chloride is white. Or maybe copper(II) sulfate solution is blue. Wait, maybe it's something else. Oh! Like sulfur trioxide? No, that's a gas. Or perhaps it's a reaction where a metal forms a compound with a high oxidation state. For example, maybe A is copper, and B is sulfur. But when copper reacts with sulfur, it forms CuS which isn't bright red. Alternatively, maybe A is iron reacting with something. Wait, maybe A is lead(IV) oxide? Or perhaps it's a reaction where lead is involved.

Wait, another thought: When lead(II) oxide reacts with chlorine gas, it can form lead(IV) chloride. Let me think, lead(II) oxide is PbO, a brown solid. Chlorine is Cl2, a gas. Reaction would be PbO + Cl2 → perhaps PbCl2? Or maybe multiple moles. Wait, if A is PbO, and B is Cl2, how would they react? Let me think stoichiometry.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps product C is lead(IV) chloride, PbCl4. How many moles would that be? If A is PbO and B is Cl2, let's write the reaction. PbO + 2 Cl2 → PbCl4 + O2? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the reaction of lead monoxide with chlorine: PbO + 2 Cl2 → PbCl4 + O2? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is an oxide reacting with B as a diatomic gas. Let's think of another bright red product.

Oh! Maybe the product is a nitride? Like magnesium nitride, but that's white. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a sulfide? But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The second reaction says when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. So E is produced from C and D. What are C and D in this case?

Looking further, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it hydrolyzes into A (the original solid), and two acids. One is strong, one weak.

So what kind of products form two different acids upon hydrolysis? Maybe if C is a sulfide, then hydrolysis would give a metal hydroxide and H2S (which is a weak acid, but wait, H2S is a weak acid, but in that case, the other product would be a metal hydroxide which isn't an acid. Hmm, not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a chloride of a metal. If C is a metal chloride that, upon hydrolysis, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, maybe if C is a chloro compound that releases HCl (strong acid) and something else. Wait, but HCl is a strong acid. If C is a salt like ammonium chloride, then hydrolysis would give NH4OH (which is weak) and HCl, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, but not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a sulfite. When it reacts with water, perhaps it forms a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), upon hydrolysis, it would produce NaOH (strong base, but maybe not here) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But I'm not sure if that fits.

Wait, maybe C is a chlorate. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce acetylene and Ca(OH)2. But that's not giving two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal di-chloride that isn't a simple salt. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal hydroxide. No, because when it reacts with water, it wouldn't produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride that is a complex salt. For example, maybe a chloro complex that upon hydrolysis releases HCl and another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is something like AlCl3, which is a Lewis acid. When AlCl3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form Al(OH)3 and HCl. So AlCl3 + 3 H2O → Al(OH)3 + 3 HCl. So F could be HCl (strong acid) and G could be whatever is produced from Al(OH)3. But Al(OH)3 isn't an acid; it's a base. Wait, so maybe that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: What if C is a metal sulfide? Let's say C is PbS. When PbS reacts with water, it doesn't react much because sulfides of heavy metals are typically unreactive in water. But maybe under certain conditions, it can hydrolyze to form a metal hydroxide and H2S. So PbS + 2 H2O → Pb(OH)2 + H2S↑. So then F could be H2S (weak acid) and G is something else. But in the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. H2S is weak, so if the other product is a strong acid, maybe the metal hydroxide is a strong acid's conjugate base.

Wait, but Pb(OH)2 is a weak base, so its conjugate acid is weak. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water: Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 + 2 NH3↑. NH3 is a weak base. So again, not matching the two acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let
