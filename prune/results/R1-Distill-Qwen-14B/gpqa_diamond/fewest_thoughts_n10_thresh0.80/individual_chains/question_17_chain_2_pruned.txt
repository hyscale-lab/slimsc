Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work it out. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, right, calcium ions in a complex with EDTA.

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the K for the complex is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, right? I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So the complex is stochiometric, which I think means that each Ca²+ combines with one EDTA^4- to form the complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Right. So K is given, and [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M.

But wait, in the solution, the total EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound to Ca²+. But since the concentration of the complex is high, and K is very large (5e10), the EDTA is mostly in the complex form. Wait, no, because K is large, the reaction favors products, meaning most of the Ca²+ and EDTA would form the complex. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

Let me set up the variables. Let's say:

[CaEDTA] = 0.02 M (given)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = y

But since the complex is formed from 1 Ca²+ and 1 EDTA^4-, the formation reaction is 1:1. So in solution, the total EDTA would be (assuming only Ca²+ and EDTA are present) [EDTA total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-]. Wait, but in reality, EDTA can also have different protonation states depending on the pH. Oh wait, the question says the pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that all EDTA is in the Y^4- form. So, the initial concentration of EDTA is equal to the sum of free EDTA and the complex.

Wait, but the initial EDTA solution would have had some concentration, but here, the complex is 0.02 M. So let's think: when you have a solution containing the complex CaEDTA, the dissociation would release Ca²+ and EDTA. So the initial concentration is all complex, and as it dissociates, some becomes free ions.

So let's model this. Let’s say the complex dissociates as follows:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) ) = 5e10.

But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA, and the dissociation is such that x is the concentration of Ca²+ formed, then [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x. But since K is very large (1e10 or higher), x would be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02, and x is negligible compared to 0.02.

So then, K ≈ (0.02)/(x * y) ) = 5e10.

But wait, the EDTA comes from the dissociation. So y is equal to x, assuming that each mole of CaEDTA that dissociates gives one mole of EDTA and one of Ca²+. So y = x.

Wait, let me think again. Each mole of complex that dissociates gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So if x is the concentration of Ca²+ produced, then [EDTA^4-] is also x.

So substituting into the K equation: 0.02/(x * x) ) ≈ 5e10.

So 0.02/(x²) = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) ≈ 1.414e-6.5, wait, sqrt(2e-13) is sqrt(2) * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So sqrt(2) is about 1
