Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so the formula would be something like CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant, K, is given, which I think is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The reaction for the formation would be: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10. So K is a very large number, meaning the reaction favors the formation of the complex, right? That implies that most of the Ca^2+ is bound into the complex, and the free ion concentration is very low.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution.

Wait, in the solution, the EDTA is present as the complex, so the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think about how to approach this.

Since the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, but EDTA is a polydentate ligand. However, in this case, we can probably use the approximation that the concentration of free Ca^2+ is very low, given the large K value. So, the concentration of free Ca^2+ would be much smaller than the initial concentration of the complex.

Let me denote the concentration of free Ca^2+ as [Ca^2+]. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would be the same because each complex releases one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4- when it dissociates. So [EDTA^4-] = [Ca^2+] = x.

The formation constant K is given by the formula:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, actually, I think the formation constant expression depends on how the reaction is written. Let me get that right. The reaction is:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

So K is ([CaEDTA^2-])/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

In this problem, the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are x each because when the complex dissociates, each produces one mole of each ion.

So substituting into the equation:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, no, if the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into x concentration of Ca^2+, then the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 - x. But wait, because the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and the dissociation is x, the concentration of the complex would be approximately 0.02 - x. But since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation x should be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, we can
