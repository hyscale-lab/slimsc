Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So if I imagine looking out into space, the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on how far away you look, but depends on the volume itself.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's think in terms of volume. Each star contributes to a certain parallax range. So the number of stars you'd observe in a given parallax range depends on the volume of space that corresponds to those parallaxes.

Let me break it down. Parallax (p) is 1/d, so d = 1/p. As parallax decreases (since p is inversely proportional to distance), the distance increases. So if I'm considering a range from p to p + dp, what's the corresponding distance range?

Hmm, if p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So when p changes by dp, the change in d is dd. Let me find the relationship between dd and dp. So, d = 1/p. Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/pÂ²) dp. Since dp is positive (we're considering
