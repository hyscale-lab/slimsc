Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this di-substituted aromatic ring compound. Let's see what the question says. 

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, so the molecule must have an O-C-O linkage, right? Esters typically have strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1, which I remember from my notes.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals total. Let's break them down. 

First, two signals correspond to aromatic H. So, the substituents on the benzene ring must be such that there are only two types of aromatic protons. Maybe the substituents are in positions that make the ring have symmetry, like para substitution. But wait, it's di-substituted, so if the two substituents are the same and para, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets. Alternatively, it could be ortho or meta, but that might complicate the symmetry. Let's think about that later.

Second, two signals are from vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are like CH2=CH- or part of a larger structure. Wait, but the ester group is O-C-O, which might be connected to some kind of substituent. Hmm, maybe the substituents are an ester and another group that has a vinyl component. 

Third, two signals correspond to –CH3 groups. So there are two sets of methyl groups. No signals for –CH2 groups, which means there are no methylene groups in the structure. So any CH2 groups are either not present or maybe as part of something else. 

Wait, but wait: the substituents on the benzene are probably an ester group and another group that has a vinyl and methyl groups. Or perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent that includes a vinyl and a methyl.

Let me think about the possible structure. An ester could be something like O-CO-O-R, but more likely, the substituent would be an ester, like an aryl ester or an alkyl ester attached to the benzene ring. 

Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are an ester group (like O-CO-O-) and another group that is a vinyl ether or something with a vinyl and methyl group attached. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group connected to a methyl. 

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So, maybe the substituent is something like a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester, but also another group with a methyl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-O-R) and a group that's a vinyl connected to a methyl, like CH2=CH-CO-O-... Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

The NMR signals are:

- Two aromatic-H signals: Let's say the substituents are in para positions, leading to two sets of aromatic protons (like a para-substituted di-ester or something similar). But perhaps it's more like one substituent is an ester (which is an electron-withdrawing group) and the other is a vinyl group with methyl substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and a group like CH2CH2COO-, but that might not fit.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible structure that would give the NMR signals described. 

In the 1H NMR, there are two aromatic signals. So perhaps the substituents are in positions that create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: two protons each, but in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite, leading to two equivalent H's on each side. But wait, maybe each substituent is different, so the ring has two substituents leading to two different sets of aromatic
