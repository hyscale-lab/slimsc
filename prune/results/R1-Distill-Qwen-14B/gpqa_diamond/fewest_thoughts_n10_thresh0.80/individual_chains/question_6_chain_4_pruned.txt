Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a given potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. The options are expressions for energy E in terms of some quantum numbers and other constants.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with potentials in quantum mechanics, especially in two dimensions, it's helpful to think about the separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation. So probably I should separate the problem into radial and angular parts.

Let me write down the potential again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, I can factor out the r²: V(r,θ) = (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ) * (k r²). So it's like V(r) times a function of θ. That suggests that the potential can be separated into radial and angular parts. 

Wait, actually, let me see: V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. So that's r² times a function of θ. That might mean that the problem has some kind of separation. So the overall potential is a sum of a purely radial term and a term that depends on θ. Or wait, no, it's a product of r² and the angular function. So perhaps the potential can be written as V(r) + V(θ), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian for a two-dimensional system in polar coordinates is (ℏ²/(2m)) [ (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) ) + (1/(r²)) ∂²/∂θ² ) ] + V(r,θ). So plugging in the V(r,θ) we have, it becomes (ℏ²/(2m)) [ (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) ) + (1/(r²)) ∂²/∂θ² ) ] + ( (k r²/2) + (3k r²/2 cos²θ) ).

Wait,
