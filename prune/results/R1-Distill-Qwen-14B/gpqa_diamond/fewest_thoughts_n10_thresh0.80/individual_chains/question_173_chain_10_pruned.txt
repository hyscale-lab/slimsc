Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that an electron is traveling at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are A to D, each a different order of magnitude in joules.

Hmm, I remember that this has to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be controlled.

The formula I think I need is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, sometimes I see it written without the 1/2, but I think the exact coefficient might not be crucial here since we're looking for an order of magnitude estimate.

So, the first step is to find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Once I have that, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy. But how?

I remember that the momentum p of a particle is given by p = mv, where m is mass and v is velocity. But in this case, since there's an uncertainty in position and thus in momentum, Δp would be related to ħ/(2Δx), approximately.

Wait, let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So, rearranging that, Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx). But for the minimum uncertainty, I guess we can take Δp as ħ/(2Δx).

But wait, some sources say the uncertainty principle is often presented as Δx Δp ≈ ħ/2, so using that approximation for the minimum uncertainty.

Once I have Δp, how does that relate to the uncertainty in energy ΔE? Oh, right, because energy and momentum are connected through the energy-momentum relation, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, since the electron is moving at a certain speed, the kinetic energy can be found using (1/2)mv², but that's the average energy, not the uncertainty.

Wait,
