Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is measured as θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, angular size... right, the event horizon's size would relate to the black hole's mass. Because I remember that the radius of the event horizon (Schwarzschild radius) is R = 2GM/c². And for a supermassive black hole, mass M is huge, so R would be large.

But how do I get from the angular size to the radius? Oh, right, using the formula for angular size: θ (in radians) ≈ opposite side / hypotenuse, which in this case is R / d. So θ ≈ R/d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. Let me think about units. I'll need to convert θ from degrees to radians. Because radians are more convenient for calculations. So 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = θ_deg * π / 180.

So θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * π / 180 ≈ 5.23e-19 radians.

But wait, wait. Let me compute that more accurately. 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me calculate that: 1e-17 * 3.1416/(180) ≈ 1e-17 * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So about 1.75e-19 radians.

Now, using θ ≈ R/d. So R = θ * d.

Wait, but d is in parsecs. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = θ_rad * d ≈ 1.75e-19 * 3.086e26 meters.

Let me compute that: 1.75e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.75 * 3.086) * 1e7. 1.75 *3 is about 5.25, 1.75 *0.086 is about 0.1505, so total around 5.4005. So 5.4e7 meters. Wait, 5.4e7 meters is 5.4e4 kilometers, which is 54,000 km. Wait, that seems big but for a supermassive black hole, maybe possible? Hmm.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius is R = 2GM/c². Using that, I can find the mass M.

So R = 2GM/c² → M = (R c²)/(2 G). Let me plug in the numbers.

R is 5.4e7 meters. c is 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s². G is 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So M = (5.4e7 m * 9e16 m²/s²) / (2 * 6.674e-11 m³/kg/s² )

Multiply numerator: 5.4e7 *9e16 = 4.86e24.

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 ≈ 1.3348e-10.

So M ≈ 4.86e24 / 1.3348e-10 = approximately 3.638e34 kg.

Wait, 3.6e34 kg? Let me check the math again.

Wait, 5.4e7 *9e16 = (5.4 *9) *1e23 = 48.6 * 1e23 = 4.86e24.

Denominator: 2 *6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10.

So 4.86e24 /1.3348e-10 = (4.86 /1.3348) *1e34. 4.86 /1.334
