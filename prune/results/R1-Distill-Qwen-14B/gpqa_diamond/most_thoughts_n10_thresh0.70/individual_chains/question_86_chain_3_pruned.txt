Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the correct starting materials for two different reactions that produce the same product but with opposite configurations.

The problem states that a chemist treated two unknown compounds, A and B, with different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. So, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, and B is treated with BH3 and H+. The options are four possible pairs of starting materials, all being 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids with either R or S configurations.

Wait, wait. Let me think about what kind of reactions these are. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3, which is typically used as a reagent in hydroboration reactions, is a milder reducing agent. Oh, wait, noâ€”BH3 is a borane and is usually used for hydroboration-oxidation, but I might be getting confused. Alternatively, sometimes BH3 is used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, but I think LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3.

Wait, no, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4, which in turn is stronger than BH3. So, BH3 is a weaker reducing agent, perhaps acting as a borohydride but maybe not as strong as LiBH4. But wait, in this context, I'm not sure. Let me think about how each reagent would affect the starting material.

The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, no, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So, pyranone would be a cyclic ketone. The product is 4-ethyl, so there's an ethyl group at position 4, and it's a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-
