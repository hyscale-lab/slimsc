Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about transmission electron microscopes and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment to improve imaging because fewer gas particles mean less electron scattering, right? But despite the vacuum, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spec.

Mike measured the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. The formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So lower pressure (which is n proportional to pressure) would mean a longer mean free path. That makes sense because in a vacuum, pressure is low, so molecules don't hit each other as often, so λ would be longer.

But then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, which isn't the same as λ1. The temperature is the same, so that doesn't explain the change. Why would λ change?

Wait, when the electron beam is active, it's generating a lot of electrons. These high-energy electrons might interact with the remaining gas molecules in the compartment. Oh! Maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize or excite, but how does that affect the mean free path?

I remember that in electron microscopy, when the electron beam passes through the gas, it can cause the gas to become ionized. This ionized gas, or plasma, behaves differently from neutral gas. In a plasma, the mean free path can be different because the interactions between particles change. In neutral gas, collisions are due to elastic or inelastic interactions, but in a plasma, there's also charged interactions which might affect the mean free path.

Wait, but how does the presence of the electron beam affect the gas? The electrons from the beam could collide with the gas molecules, ionizing them. Once ionized, these charged particles (ions and electrons) would experience electric fields, perhaps from the beam or other sources, leading to different behaviors.

Alternatively, the electron beam might cause the gas to be more conductive, but that's probably not directly relevant.

Let me think about the physics here. The mean free path in a gas depends on the number of collisions. If the gas is ionized, the ions can move under the influence of electric fields, which could affect their movement and collisions. Also, in a plasma, the Debye length comes into play, which is a measure of how far a charge's electric field can propagate in the plasma. A longer Debye length means the plasma is a poorer conductor, and that could influence how the free electrons and ions move, affecting their mean free path.

But wait, the presence of the electron beam could also cause an increase in the effective pressure. Oh, wait, no, because the beam is providing energy to the gas. Alternatively, the gas molecules might be getting knocked around more by the electrons, increasing the frequency of collisions. Or wait, perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to be more energetic, which would increase the rate of collisions, thus decreasing the mean free path.

Wait, but in the initial condition, the mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is on, we have λ2. So what's changing here?

I think when the electrons are present and the gas is ionized, the mean free path could change. For example, in a plasma, the mean free path can be shorter because the charged particles interact more strongly, leading to more frequent collisions. Or maybe the ions and electrons cause more scattering of the electrons in the beam, but that's about the beam itself, not the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. So the gas is maybe ionized. If the gas becomes ionized, the ions might have different cross-sections for collisions. Or perhaps the electron beam introduces more scattering events for the gas molecules, so their mean free path decreases.

Wait, but the mean free path λ1 was determined under vacuum conditions before the beam was on. When the beam is on, the gas may ionize, leading to a different effective pressure or different behavior. Let me think about the formula for mean free path.

The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the square root of pressure (or proportional to sqrt(T) over pressure, maybe? Wait, the formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where d is the diameter of the molecules, T is temperature, and P is pressure. So, if conditions change, but pressure and temperature stay the same, λ remains the same. But in this case, the presence of the electron beam doesn't change P or T. So why would λ change?

Wait, but the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to ionize. So the gas is now a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path might be shorter because charged particles can interact via Coulomb forces, which can lead to more frequent collisions. Or perhaps the effective pressure is increased because the charged particles respond differently to the beam's electric fields.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes a change in the effective cross-section. For instance, if the gas is ionized, the ions may have a larger effective cross-section because they carry charge, leading to more collisions and a shorter mean free path.

Wait, another approach: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules (like, say, residual air or other gases) are bombarded by the electrons. These electrons can cause the gas to ionize. So now, the gas is partially ionized. The ionized gas (plasma) may have a different behavior in terms of mean free path.

In a plasma, the mean free path can be calculated, but it's more complicated. But generally, in a plasma, the mean free path can be longer or shorter than in neutral gas depending on the conditions. Wait, but in a plasma, the charged particles can have long-range interactions. However, in a low-density plasma, like this ultra-high vacuum, the plasma is very tenuous. So the mean free path might be longer because the density is so low that collisions are infrequent. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when the gas is ionized, the electrons are free to move, so maybe the gas behaves more like a conductor, but how does that affect collisions?

Wait, wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up. Oh, but the question states that the temperature remains the same. So no change in T.

Another angle: when the electron beam is active, it creates a current. The gas in the beam's path might become a conductor, leading to a current that affects the gas's behavior. But I'm not sure how that directly affects the mean free path of the gas molecules.

Wait, another thought: in a vacuum, the mean free path λ1 is determined by the neutral gas. When the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ions and electrons may have different mean free paths. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, which are now either neutral or ionized.

Wait, perhaps the ionization changes the effective collision cross-section. For example, if the gas is ionized, the effective cross-section for collisions could be larger, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Alternatively, when the gas is ionized, the positively charged ions are attracted to the negatively charged areas in the electron beam, and vice versa. This could cause the ions to move more, perhaps increasing the rate of collisions, thereby reducing λ.

Wait, but the question says the sample compartment temperature remains the same. So temperature is fixed.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what else affects the mean free path. The main factors are pressure, temperature, and the cross-sectional area of the molecules. If the pressure is the same, and temperature is the same, then λ should be the same. But in this case, the presence of the electron beam must be introducing another factor.

So why would the mean free path change when the beam is on? Maybe because the gas is ionized, the effective pressure is higher. Or perhaps because the gas is ionized, there's a different effective number of collisions.

Wait, think about it this way: when the gas is neutral, the mean free path is λ1. When ionized, the gas becomes a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the charged particles are subject to electric fields, but in this case, the electric fields would be from the electron beam. Hmm, but in that scenario, charged particles might experience forces that influence their movement, possibly making their paths longer because they're being accelerated or deflected, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized state leads to more frequent collisions because the ions and electrons can interact more strongly with each other. So the mean free path decreases.

Wait, but in a plasma, the mean free path can be longer. For example, in a very low-density plasma, the mean free path is large because the ions and electrons don't collide often. But if the plasma is more dense, the mean free path is smaller. But in our case, the pressure is still low because it's an ultra-high vacuum. So perhaps the mean free path is longer in the plasma than in the neutral gas.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of it another way. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a neutral gas, the collisions are mainly elastic. In a plasma, collisions can involve Coulomb interactions, which are longer-range. So, perhaps in a plasma, the mean free path is longer because the molecules (ions, electrons) have a higher chance of colliding over longer distances. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, Coulomb collisions have a cross-section that's larger because the potential extends over a longer distance. So the collision cross-section σ is larger. Since λ is inversely proportional to σ, a larger σ would lead to a smaller λ.

So if gas is ionized, σ increases, so λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

But wait, the mean free path formula is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ). n is the number density, which depends on pressure. If the pressure is the same, n is the same. But if σ increases because of ionization, then λ decreases.

So in this case, when the beam is on, the gas is ionized, σ increases, so λ2 < λ1.

Wait, no, but wait, in the initial case, λ1 is based on the neutral gas. Once ionized, the cross-sections change. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

So, the conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1, which would mean option C is correct.

But wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas is being bombarded by high-energy electrons. This might cause the gas to become more ionized, but it also increases the kinetic energy of the gas molecules, possibly increasing their speed. How does that affect the mean free path?

The mean free path is also proportional to the average speed of the molecules. The average speed is sqrt(3kT/m), so if the temperature is the same, speed is the same. So, that doesn't change λ, but wait, if the gas is heated, but the question states that temperature remains the same. So speed remains same.

But in the case of ionized gas, the speed might be different due to ionization. For example, ions have a different mass than neutral gas molecules. But the question doesn't specify if the species' mass changes; it's just gas particles.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas has a different effective mass. But that's probably more complicated.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, the cross-section for collisions may increase, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

So, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1, so option C is correct.


To analyze the situation, we consider the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Initially, in the ultra-high vacuum state (< 10⁻⁹ Torr), the mean free path is determined to be λ₁. However, when the electron beam is activated, the mean free path changes to λ₂. The key factors influencing this change are the interactions between the gas molecules and the electron beam.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path in Neutral Gas**:  
   The mean free path λ₁ is calculated under vacuum conditions, where the gas is neutral. The formula for mean free path is:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot n \cdot \sigma}
   \]  
   Here, \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, and \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section. In a neutral gas, collisions are primarily elastic, and the mean free path depends on the pressure, temperature, and molecular properties.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   When the electron beam is activated, the gas molecules in the sample compartment may become ionized, forming a plasma. In this ionized state:
   - The collision cross-section \(\sigma\) increases due to Coulomb interactions between charged particles (ions and electrons).
   - The increased cross-section leads to more frequent collisions, reducing the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions.

3. **Temperature and Pressure**:  
   The problem states that the temperature remains constant, and the vacuum pressure is already ultra-high. These conditions suggest that the primary change is due to the ionization of the gas caused by the electron beam, rather than changes in temperature or pressure.

4. **Comparison of λ₁ and λ₂**:  
   Since the collision cross-section \(\sigma\) increases in the ionized state, the mean free path \(\lambda\) decreases. Therefore, \(\lambda₂ < \lambda₁\).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\(\lambda₂ \geq 1.22 \cdot \lambda₁\))**: Incorrect. The mean free path cannot increase in this scenario because ionization reduces the mean free path due to stronger interactions.
- **Option B (\(\lambda₂ = \lambda₁\))**: Incorrect. The observation explicitly states that \(\lambda₂ \neq \lambda₁\), as the electron beam alters the gas behavior.
- **Option C (\(\lambda₂ < \lambda₁\))**: Correct. Ionization increases the collision cross-section, leading to a shorter mean free path.
- **Option D (\(1.22 \cdot \lambda₁ > \lambda₂ > \lambda₁\))**: Incorrect. The mean free path decreases, not increases, when the electron beam is activated.

### Conclusion:
The mean free path decreases when the electron beam is activated due to ionization effects, leading to \(\lambda₂ < \lambda₁\).
