Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. The particle is in a specific superposition state, and the operator given is 10σz +5σx. Alright, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to apply this operator to the given state and find the expectation.

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Wait, let me check if the coefficients square to 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. 0.25 +0.75=1, so that's good. The state is normalized.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. Since σz and σx are Pauli matrices, their expectation values can be found separately and then combined.

I think the expectation value of the operator is the sum of the expectations of each term. So, E = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. σz is the Pauli z matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. So, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is just the sum of probabilities times their eigenvalues.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the probability of being in |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and in |↓⟩ it's (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 =0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, let me make sure. Because |↑⟩ is an eigenstate, the expectation is just the coefficient squared times the eigenvalue. So yes, that's right.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but they are the eigenstates of σz rotated by 90 degrees. So I can't directly use the coefficients as I did for σz. I need to compute the expectation value using the state.

I think the expectation of σx can be found using the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me write this out.

The state |ψ⟩ is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the bra vector is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2), assuming |↑⟩ is the first component and |↓⟩ is the second.

Sigma x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can compute:

(0.5, sqrt(3)/2) * σx * (0.5, sqrt(3)/2)†

Wait, no, because when you multiply, you have to do it as a matrix multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation using the components. Let me write |ψ⟩ as a column vector: [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Then σx is:

[0 1;
1 0]

So σx |ψ⟩ is:

[ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2) ) ] = [ sqrt(3)/2 ]
[ (1)(0.5) + 0 ] = [ 0.5 ]

So the resulting vector is [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T.

Then ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ multiplied by σx |ψ⟩.

The conjugate transpose is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So multiply each component:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * (0.5) )

Hmm, that's 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*( sqrt(3)/4 ) ) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, that can't be right because the maximum value of σx expectation is 1 (since σx has eigenvalues ±1). But sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, which is less than 1, so it's possible.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of σx is given by 2 times the real part of the product of the first component with the conjugate of the second component. Because for spin-1/2, the expectation of σx is 2 Re(ψ₁ ψ₂* ) where ψ is in the basis |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Wait, wait, let me think. The standard formula is ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re( a * b^* ), where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩, b is the coefficient of |↓⟩.

So in this case, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a*b^* is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4. The real part is sqrt(3)/4 since it's already real.

So 2 * sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, let me make sure. Oh wait, σx has eigenvalues ±1, so the expectation should be between -1 and +1. 0.866 is within that range, so that makes sense.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of the operator is 10 * (-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Compute each term:

10 * (-0.5) is -5.

5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (5 * 1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2 ≈ 4.330125.

So adding these: -5 +4.330125 ≈ -0.669875.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.8660 = 4.330.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. So, -5 +4.330 = -0.669875.

But the options given are: A) -1.4, B)1.65, C) -0.7, D)
