Okay, so I've got this problem about Michael addition reactions, and I need to figure out the products. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion. So, looking at the reactions given, I need to analyze each one.

The first reaction is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. I think malonate is a dienophile in some reactions, but here it's acting as the nucleophile. The other reagent is an acrylate, which has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the malonate's enolate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate group is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but wait, no, wait. The numbering might be tricky. For (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Or wait, maybe it's more like CH2-CH2 with substituents? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon. So it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, wait. No, wait, structure for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3, making it CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, that can't be right because the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 (CH2=CH-), and the substituent at carbon 3 is p-tolyl. So it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, that's not right because the acrylate is an ester. The structure should be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, the carbonyl is at the end. So maybe it
