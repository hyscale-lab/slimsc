Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics yet, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are given as A to D with velocities around 0.7c to 0.96c.

Hmm. So first, let me try to visualize what's happening. Proton and antiproton annihilate each other and produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, and four A particles in total in the products.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh right, that probably means we can assume it's non-relativistic, which might simplify things. Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe it's easier in the lab frame where the proton is stationary? Or wait, no, the setup is that the antiproton is the one moving slowly. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, in the annihilation, the collision is between a proton and an antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the system's center of mass frame is not too different from the lab frame. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let me think. In particle reactions, it's often useful to look at conservation laws. So, conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving, but the proton is at rest? Or maybe they're both moving, but the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest in the lab frame, and the antiproton
