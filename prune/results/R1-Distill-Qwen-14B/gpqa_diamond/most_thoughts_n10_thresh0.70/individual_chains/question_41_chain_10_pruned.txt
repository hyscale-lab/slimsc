Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is going through the glass and moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light? Or is it that the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer too? The wording says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the beam is also moving towards the observer.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? So when the medium itself is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light?

Hmm, this must be a problem involving special relativity since velocities are involved and the speed of light is a factor. Oh wait, but the glass here is moving at a velocity v which is presumably much less than c, since we're dealing with glass and everyday velocities. But maybe that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, but in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity addition formulas are more complicated. Let me recall the formula. The velocity of an object in one frame from another is given by (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), right? Where u is the velocity in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the second frame relative to the first. But wait, that's when the velocities are in the same direction.

Wait, but in this case, the medium is moving. The light's velocity in the medium is u = c/n, but wait, no. Wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But from the lab frame, where the glass is moving, how does that change?

Wait, but the glass is moving towards the observer. So the lab frame is the observer's frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same
