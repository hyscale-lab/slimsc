Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. Oh, and they gave me c as 1, which makes things a bit simpler because I don't have to plug in the actual value of the speed of light.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let's see:

Option A: (1 + n*v)/(n + v)
Option B: 1
Option C: (1 + n*v)/(n - v)
Option D: (1 - n*v)/(n + v)

Wait, okay, so the key here is understanding how the speed of light in a medium relates when the medium itself is moving. I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, in the glass, the speed would be 1/n since c is 1 here.

But the glass is moving. How does that affect the observed speed? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think it's related to the Doppler effect or maybe the addition of velocities in special relativity, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought—could it be a case of adding the velocities as in classical mechanics, or does special relativity come into play?

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving along with it. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion.

In classical mechanics, when objects move, their velocities add. But for light, it's different because of the postulates of special relativity. Oh right, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Wait, but wait—the speed of light in the medium is already less than c, right? Because it's inside the glass, moving at 1/n.

Wait, but the medium itself (the glass) is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of light in that medium from the lab's perspective?

I think I need to consider the frame of reference here. Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v
