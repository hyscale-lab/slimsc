Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4.

Hmm, that's a lot of steps. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize each step and understand the reactions involved.

Starting with the first reaction: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene derivative, right? Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. So the starting material has a tert-butoxy group at position 7. Okay.

Then, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, especially since I- is a good leaving group. Hmm. The other compound has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6 of a cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, each of those methyl groups has two bromines attached, making them each a dibromomethyl group.

Wait, when you have two equivalents of this diene, that probably means each equivalent contributes two bromomethyl groups. Or maybe each diene molecule can react twice.

Wait, sodium iodide is likely acting as a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So perhaps the norbornene compound is undergoing some kind of nucleophilic substitution. But norbornene is a bicyclic compound, maybe with some strain, so perhaps it's undergoing ring-opening or some addition.

Wait, the starting compound has a tert-butoxy group. Tert-butoxy is a good bulky group. Maybe it's acting as an electron-donating group, activating the ring towards some kind of attack.

Wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with dibromomethyl groups at 5 and 6. So each of those substituents is CH2Br2. So each has two Brs on a CH2.

So when the diene reacts with the iodide, perhaps an iodide substitution occurs? Or maybe an elimination.

Wait, but perhaps this is a ring-opening metathesis? No, maybe more likely a Diels-Alder reaction? But the starting material is a diene itself. Wait, norbornene is a diene, right? So if that's the case
