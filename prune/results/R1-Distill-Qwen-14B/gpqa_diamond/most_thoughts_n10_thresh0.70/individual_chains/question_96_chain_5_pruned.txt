Okay, I've got this problem about a black hole's entropy. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question gives me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance to the galaxy, and I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, what do I remember about black holes and entropy? Oh right, I think the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, right? Or wait, maybe it's S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants.

So the first thing I need is the area of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so the area should be 4πr², where r is the radius of the event horizon. But how do I find r?

The problem gives me the angular size θ in degrees. Oh, right, angular size relates to the actual size using the distance. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ (r) / d, where θ is in radians, r is the size, and d is the distance. But wait, the formula I remember is θ (in radians) ≈ (2r)/d, assuming θ is small. Or maybe it's (r)/d. Hmm, wait, more accurately, the angular diameter is approximately (2r)/d. Since θ is small, it's approximately the same as r/d for small angles.

Wait, let's think. The formula for the angular diameter is θ = 2 * (r) / (d), where θ is in radians. So if I have θ in degrees, I need to convert it to radians first.

The given θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians. 1 degree is π/180 radians, so θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180.

Then, using θ ≈ 2r/d, I can solve for r. So r = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The angular diameter formula is θ (in radians) = 2r / (d). So solving for r gives r = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

But wait,
