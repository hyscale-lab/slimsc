Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li is lithium, right? So the standard notation is Li-6 or Li-7 depending on the number of neutrons. Wait, the problem says Li with 3 neutrons. So the lithium isotope would be Li-6 because lithium has 3 protons normally, so 3 neutrons would give a mass number of 6 (3 protons +3 neutrons=6). So the nucleus is Li-6.

Next, I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy given to the particles is the kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes people talk about total energy, which includes the rest mass energy. Oh right, in relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. But when they refer to the energy of the collider, I think they mean the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, sometimes colliders specify the energy as the kinetic energy, but I should double-check the formulas.

The problem states: the energy of RHIC. Wait, what's the typical way RHIC's energy is reported? I think RHIC collides heavy ions like gold nuclei at a certain energy. Oh, but I'm not sure about the exact convention. But in physics, when you're given a speed and asked for the energy, it's usually the total energy, which is gamma * m * c². However, sometimes the kinetic energy is the focus. So I need to clarify what's being asked.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." I'm not exactly sure if they're referring to the kinetic energy or the total energy. But since the speed is given, maybe I can calculate the gamma factor first, and then find the total energy as gamma times the rest mass energy, but I need to be careful.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate gamma (γ) when the speed v is 0.96c.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy. But wait,
