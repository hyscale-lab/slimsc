Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating probabilities and an average value for a given operator.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. Oh right, so for spin-1/2 particles, these are the standard basis states. 

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because the problem says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. So I should compute the normalization factor. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, so to find the normalization constant, I'll compute the inner product of this with itself.

Calculating the inner product: (1+i)*(1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i). Let me compute each term. 

The first term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*1 + 1*(-i) + i*1 + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². Since i² is -1, that becomes 1 + 1 = 2. 

The second term: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2² - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5. 

So adding these, the inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Now, the operator we're considering has a matrix representation A where A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Let me write this for a 2x2 matrix. 

So the matrix would be:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait a second, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because Pauli X is [[0 1],[1 0]], so yeah, that matches. So the operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. 

But wait, sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the operator
