Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about an electron's state and calculating probabilities and an average value of an operator. Hmm. Let's parse the problem.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think means they form the basis for the spin-½ system. So, the state can be written as |alpha> = a(1+i)|up> + a(2-i)|down>, and we need to find 'a' to normalize it since the problem says it's proportional.

Wait, wait, I remember that for normalization, the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients should equal 1. So I need to compute the squared magnitude of each coefficient, add them, set equal to 1, and solve for 'a'.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let me calculate their magnitudes. The magnitude of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²).

For (1 + i): magnitude squared is (1² +1²) = 2.

For (2 - i): magnitude squared is (2² + (-1)²) =4 +1=5.

So the total squared magnitude is (2 +5) |a|² =7|a|². To normalize, set 7|a|²=1 → |a|²=1/7 → a = 1/sqrt(7). But since the state is already given as proportional, the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7). So the state is:

|alpha> = [(1+i)/sqrt(7)] |up> + [(2 -i)/sqrt(7)] |down>.

Now, the next part is about another operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given as hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. For a spin-½ system, the Pauli matrices are 2x2. Let me think: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which has off-diagonal elements 1 and 0 on the diagonal. So if this operator A has A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j and 0 otherwise, its matrix would be:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

But wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so scaling it by hbar/2 would give this operator. So this operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator is (hbar/2) σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator. Wait, but in the problem, we are to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of operator A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenstates of operator A and then compute the probability amplitudes.

What are the eigenstates of σ_x? I remember that σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, and the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis.

The eigenstates can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, actually, I might have to double-check that. Let me recall: the eigenstates of σ_x are such that σ_x |+x> = +|+x> and σ_x |-x> = -|−x>. So, |+x> would be (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), yes, and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) to normalize.

So, the eigenstates of operator A, which is (hbar/2) σ_x, would have eigenvalues ± hbar/2. But since A is proportional to σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x.

So now, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then the square of the coefficients' magnitudes will give the probabilities.

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
Similarly, |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = a (1+i) |up> + a (2 -i) |down> where a=1/sqrt(7).

Wait, no, the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7). So:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

I need to express this as a combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me substitute |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) 
+ [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(14).

So:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ] / sqrt(14)

Let me expand the numerator:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x>

Grouping terms:

[(1+i) + (2 -i)] |+x> + [(1+i) - (2 -i)] |-x>

Compute the coefficients:

Coefficient of |+x>:
(1+i + 2 -i) = (3) → 3

Coefficient of |-x>:
(1+i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i)

So numerator becomes 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x>

So |alpha> is [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, but wait, that is:

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + ( -1 + 2i ) |-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Hmm, but to find the probability of measuring |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients are the amplitudes, so the probabilities are |3|^2 /14 and |(-1+2i)|^2 /14.

Wait, no: because when you express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, the coefficients are (3/sqrt(14)) and [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ].

So the probability for |+x> is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14.

Similarly, the probability for |-x> is | (-1 + 2i) |² /14.

Compute | -1 + 2i |²: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So 5/14.

Wait, wait. 9 +5 =14, so that's correct because 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36).

Hmm, looking at the options, option A gives 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, the operator question is about the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, so the probabilities should be 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So for the probabilities, the first part is 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14≈0.36.

But wait, let me just check the calculations again because sometimes I can make sign mistakes.

Wait, in the expression for |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I had:

(1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) 

Expanding:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2-i)|+x> - (2-i)|-x> 

Which becomes [ (1+i +2 -i) ] |+x> + [ (1+i - (2 -i
