Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see what it's asking. The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which I guess means that the conditions are perfect for the complex to form, and the temperature is 25°C. They also gave the formation constant, KCa-EDTA, which is 5x10^10.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, what's the concentration of calcium ions in that solution. So I'm trying to find [Ca²+], right.

I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction. So for the Ca-EDTA complex, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. And the formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in this problem, they've given the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So that's the concentration of the complex, which is the numerator in the Kf expression. So [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M.

I need to find [Ca²+]. Let's think about the variables. The Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the reaction strongly favors the product (the complex). So the concentrations of the free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- will be very low because almost all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex.

The problem is to find [Ca²+], so let's set up the equation. Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) → [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−]/(Kf * [EDTA^4-]).

But wait, I don't know [EDTA^4-]. Hmm. Maybe I can make an assumption here. Because the formation constant is so large, the concentration of free Ca²+ will be very small. So perhaps
