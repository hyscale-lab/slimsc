Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-.

The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). But wait, in this problem, they're saying the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. That means [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M, right?

So, I think I can rearrange the K equation to solve for [Ca²+]. Let me write that down. [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−] / (K * [EDTA⁴−])

Wait, but wait, wait. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in this case, the complex is already formed. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That implies that the solution has [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M.

But then, EDTA is involved, so I might need to consider the dissociation of EDTA. Wait, no, because the complex is in solution. So, the dissociation is the reverse of the formation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The formation constant K is given. The complex is 0.02 M. So, in solution, the concentration of free Ca²+ and free EDTA will be very low because K is large, meaning the reaction favors the formation of the complex.

So, let's model this. Let me set up the variables.

Let me denote [Ca²+] as x, and [EDTA⁴−] as y. But wait, since the complex is 0.02 M, [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. So, the formation constant equation is:

K = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca
