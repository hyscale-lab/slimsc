Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about transit probabilities. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, that researchers want to observe using the transit method. They have limited time, so they need to choose the one with the higher probability of transiting. 

From what I remember, the transit method detects exoplanets when they pass in front of their host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability that this happens depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit—specifically, the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. 

The problem states that both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period means it's orbiting more quickly, probably in a tighter orbit. 

Wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the mass of the star (M). So, P² ∝ (a³)/(M). Since Planet_1 has a shorter period (P1 = P2 /3), and the host star of Planet_1 is more massive (M1 = 2*M2), we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Let me write that down. 

For Planet_1: P1² = (4π²/G M1) * a1³

For Planet_2: P2² = (4π²/G M2) * a2³

Dividing the two equations: (P1²)/(P2²) = (a1³ M2)/(a2³ M1)

But P1 = P2/3, so ( (P2/3)^2 ) / (P2²) ) = (a1³ M2)/(a2³ M1) )

Calculating the left side: (P2²/9) / P2² = 1/9.

So 1/9 = (a1³ M2)/(a2³ M1)

But M1 is 2 M2, so substituting that in:

1/9 = (a1³ M2) / (a2³ * 2 M2) ) 

Simplify: 1/9 = (a1³)/(2 a2³)

Multiply both sides by 2 a2³:

2 a2³ / 9 = a1³

Take cube roots: a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2

Wait, 2/9 is about 0.222, the cube root of that is approximately 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's, which makes sense since it's closer.

But how does this affect the transit probability?

Transit probability depends on the size of the star and the orbital distance. The formula I recall is:

Probability = (R_star + R_planet) / a 

Wait, no, actually, the geometric probability is roughly (R_star / a)², or is it (R_star / a) multiplied by something else? Or wait, maybe it's (R_star/(a)) multiplied by some function of the impact parameter. Hmm, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_star / a) * (something), but I think the exact formula is more like (R_star / a) multiplied by a factor based on the orbital inclination. But since the planets are already detected via the radial velocity method, which tells us that they have a certain minimum mass and that their orbits are likely edge-on enough for the RV method to detect them. But for the transit probability, the chance that the orbit is aligned such that it transits is a separate factor.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a. But actually, the exact formula is (R_star / a) * (something about the inclination), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)², but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another thought: The transit probability P is approximately (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (e^2/2)) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it's just (R_*/a).

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned to cross our line of sight) is actually (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability based on the orbital distance. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to look it up in my mind.

Oh wait, the transit probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since the planets are Earth-like and the stars' radii are given, but in this problem, the exact R_planet isn't given. Wait, the problem says both host stars have the same radii. Oh, wait
