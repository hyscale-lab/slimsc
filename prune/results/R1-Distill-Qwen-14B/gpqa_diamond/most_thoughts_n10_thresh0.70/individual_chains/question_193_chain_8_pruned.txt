Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. It says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r). So plx = 1/(r), where r is in parsecs, I think. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

Wait, the formula they give is number of stars N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, I can write plx as 1/r. So substituting that into N, it becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 

(1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, so what's the exact wording? It says, "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh, wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. It's asking for the number as a function of distance, not the density. Or perhaps it's about the differential change, like how many stars are there between r and r+dr?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The number of stars as a function of parallax is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N ∝ r^5. But that's if you're considering a certain volume or something. Wait, no—wait, the way the problem is stated, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit volume? Or is it the number in a shell of radius r and thickness dr?

Wait, let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is equal to 1/r (in parsecs), so plx = 1/r. So as r increases, plx decreases. 

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So
