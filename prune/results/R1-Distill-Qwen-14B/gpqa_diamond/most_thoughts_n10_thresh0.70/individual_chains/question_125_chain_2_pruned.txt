Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator, so V(r) = ½ m ω² r². Right, and the force is Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -kr and k would be m ω squared. 

Wait, the question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. So I need to find both the energy value and the degeneracy, which is the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy.

In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. I think the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z for each direction. But wait, in spherical coordinates, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the total quantum number n, which is related to the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, no. Let me think. In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Each direction has its own quantum number, say n_x, n_y, n_z, and each contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω. So the total energy E would be (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes people write it in terms of the total quantum number N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, no, that can't be right because for each direction, the energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω. So summing them, E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3
