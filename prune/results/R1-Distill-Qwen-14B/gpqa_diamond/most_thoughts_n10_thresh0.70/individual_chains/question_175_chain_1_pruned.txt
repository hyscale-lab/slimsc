Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated at a specific angle and the functional form of the power.

The setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they want the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and what form f takes.

I recall that for dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle has a specific dependence on the angle. Dipole radiation has a radiation pattern that depends on cosθ squared, I think. So the power radiated in a particular direction is proportional to (sinθ)^2, but wait, no, maybe it's cos^2θ or something else. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole axis, which is along z in this case. So the power should be maximum at θ=90 degrees, and go to zero at θ=0 and 180.

The formula for the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is something like (p^2)/(something) multiplied by (sinθ)^2, where p is the dipole moment. Or wait, maybe it's proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum occurs when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. So the maximum would be when sinθ is 1, which gives the highest value.

But the problem is asking about the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ=30 degrees. So I need to find f(theta=30)/A.

Wait, what is f(theta) exactly? It's the power per unit solid angle. So f(theta) must be the expression for the power in each direction. Let me think about the formula for the power radiated by an oscillating dipole.

The average power radiated by a dipole is ( (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴ )/(12π c³) ), but that's the total power. The power per unit solid angle, I think, is given by something like (p² ω⁴ / (something)) * (sinθ)^2. Alternatively, the radiation pattern for electric dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So at θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so sin^2θ is 0.25. That would mean that the power per solid angle at 30 degrees is a quarter of the maximum, right? Because the maximum is when θ=90 degrees, sin^2=1.

Wait, but wait. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So if the maximum in the function f is at θ=90 degrees, then f(theta=30) would be (0.5)^2 times the maximum value. So f(theta=30) = (1/2)^2 * f(max) = (1/4) * A. Because A is the maximum power, so the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait again. The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. For a dipole, the total power is constant, so the integral of f(theta) over all angles should equal the total power. But if f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta), then when you integrate sin^2(theta) over theta from 0 to pi and phi from 0 to 2pi, you get 4pi/3. So the total power would be A * (4pi/3) * (some factor), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f(theta) is normalized such that the maximum is A. So f(theta) = A * (sin^2(theta)), but wait, that's probably not right because integrating that over all solid angles would give a certain value. So perhaps the function is f(theta) = A * (sin^2(theta)) / (some factor).

Wait, let me think again. The maximum power per unit solid angle is A. So for a dipole, the radiation pattern is such that the power per unit solid angle is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and varies as sin²θ. So f(theta) = A sin²θ. No, wait, no, because the maximum of f would be A, so when sinθ is 1, f is A. So yes, f(theta) = A sin²θ. But wait, that can't be, because when you integrate f(theta) over all angles, you get the total power.

Wait, the total power P_total is the integral of f(theta) dΩ. Since dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ, so P_total = integral (over phi 0 to 2pi) integral (theta 0 to pi) [f(theta) * sin theta] dtheta dphi.

If f(theta) = A sin^2 theta, then P_total = A * integral (0 to 2pi) dφ integral (0 to pi) sin^3 theta dtheta.

Calculating this:

Integral from 0 to 2pi dφ is 2pi.

Integral of sin^3 theta d theta from 0 to pi is 4/3. Because ∫ sin^3 theta d theta from 0 to pi is 4/3. Let me compute that: Let u = cos theta, du = -sin theta d theta. So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - u^2) sin^2 theta d theta? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute ∫ sin^3 theta d theta.

Wait, sin^3 theta = sin theta (1 - cos^2 theta). So ∫ sin^3 theta d theta from 0 to pi is ∫ sin theta (1 - cos^2 theta) d theta.

Let u = cos theta, du = -sin theta d theta.

So when theta = 0, u=1; theta=pi, u=-1.

So ∫ [ (1 - u^2) (-du) ] from u=1 to u=-1.

Which is ∫ (u^2 - 1) du from -1 to 1.

So,

∫ (u^2 -1) du from -1 to 1 is [ (u^3/3) - u ] from -1 to 1.

At u=1: (1/3 -1) = -2/3.

At u=-1: ( (-1)^3/3 - (-1) ) = (-1/3 +1) = 2/3.

So the difference is (-2/3) - (2/3) )= -4/3.

But because of the substitution, we have:

∫ sin^3 theta d theta from 0 to pi is equal to ∫ (u^2 -1) du from -1 to 1, which is (-4/3). Wait, but the way we set it up:

Original integral is from 0 to pi: ∫ sin^3 theta d theta = ∫ (1 - u^2) (-du) ) from 1 to -1.

Which is the same as ∫ (1 - u^2) du from -1 to 1.

Which is [ u - u^3/3 ] evaluated from -1 to 1.

At 1: 1 - (1/3) = 2/3.

At -1: (-1) - ( (-1)^3 /3 ) = (-1) - (-1/3) = (-1) + 1/3 = -2/3.

So the integral is (2/3) - (-2/3) )= 4/3.

So yes, the integral is 4/3.

So P_total = A * 2pi * (4/3) = (8 pi A)/3.

But the maximum power is A, which is the maximum f(theta). Wait, but the question says that the maximum power is A. So the total power is (8 pi A)/3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Maybe I'm complicating things. Let's get back to the problem.

The function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. The maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees, which is A. So f(theta) = A (sin theta)^2.

So, when theta is 30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so (sin theta)^2 = 0.25. Therefore, f(theta=30) = A * 0.25.

Wait, no, because f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, so the value at theta=30 is 0.25 A.

But wait, the maximum power is A, so the fraction would be 0.25 A / A = 0.25, which is 1/4.

So fraction is 1/4.

Now for the functional form of f. The power per unit solid angle for dipole radiation is proportional to (sin theta)^2, so f is proportional to sin^2(theta). But the question is about the dependence on lambda.

So how does the power per unit solid angle depend on lambda?

Dipole radiation power is given by P = ( (μ₀ p₀^2 ω^4 )/(12 π c^3) ). Wait, but that's the total power. For the power per solid angle, which is f(theta), it
