Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the uncertainty principle. Let's see what the question says. An electron is moving at a speed of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

Wait, the Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least on the order of Planck's constant over 2π. Oh right, the formula is Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is h/(2π). But sometimes people use the approximation that ΔxΔp ≈ ħ, especially for order-of-magnitude estimates.

So, if I can find Δp, I can find ΔE. Because energy is related to momentum. Since the electron is moving at a certain speed, its momentum p is mv. But wait, the problem gives the speed, so I can calculate the momentum. But wait, no, because we're dealing with uncertainties. Oh, right, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. But wait, if the electron's momentum is p = mv, and the speed is given, but I don't know the uncertainty in the speed. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, the question is about the minimum uncertainty in energy. So I think I should use the uncertainty principle to find Δp first, then relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

So, let's compute Δp. Using the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≈ ħ. So Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

But wait, the Planck constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Wait, but for
