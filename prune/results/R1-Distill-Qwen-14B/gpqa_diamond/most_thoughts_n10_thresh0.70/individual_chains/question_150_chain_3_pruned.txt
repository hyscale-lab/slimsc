Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me see if I can think this through step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and there are three reagents used in a reaction sequence. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to try to determine the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, let me think about each peak.

The 9.72 ppm triplet is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's a strong hint that the compound has an aldehyde group. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton next to an aldehyde? Not sure yet.

Looking at the aromatic regions: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets. That often indicates a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons are usually split into doublets. So maybe there are two phenyl groups attached to the molecule. Let me think: the 6.98 ppm might be a proton that's more deshielded, maybe attached to a nitro group or another substituent, but wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the substituents should include a nitro group? Wait, no, wait. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Degree of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. For C8H9NO, the formula is C8H9NO. The general formula is CnH2n+2OxN. For n=8, 2n+2=18. So the actual H is 9, so 18-9=9, divided by 2 gives 4.5. But wait, each N is considered as adding one H. So maybe I should recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So the formula is C8H9NO. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Where X is halogens, but here there are none. So, N is +1. So:

(2*8 + 2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's either five rings, but that's unlikely. More likely a combination of rings and double bonds.

So maybe one ring (like a benzene ring, which is 3 degrees), and two double bonds (like two alkenes or an aldehyde and an alkene), plus maybe another ring or double bond.

Wait, the aldehyde is a double bond (C=O). So that's one. A benzene ring is three. So that's four, so one more. Maybe another double bond, say in an enal structure.

Looking at the NMR again:

At 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H. That could be vinyl protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like an aldehyde. Also, the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That might be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. Wait, but in the starting compound, the formula is C8H9NO, which suggests it might have a nitro group. Alternatively, maybe a hydroxyl group, but then the formula would have an extra O, right?

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So it has one N
