Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

So, the question involves organic chemistry reactions, specifically dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid to form an anhydride, and then a reaction of that anhydride with tetramethylcyclopentadiene to form products. Then, looking at their NMR spectra, particularly the NOESY, to figure out which resonances are connected.

First, I'll break down the information given.

1. **Initial Reaction: Dehydration of Dicarboxylic Acid**
   The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of such acids typically forms an anhydride. Since the alkene is cis, the dehydration would form an anhydride where the two carbonyl groups are positioned in a way that reflects the geometry of the starting alkene. Wait, but wait, when a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-dioic structure is dehydrated, it usually forms a cyclic anhydride. But since the starting material has a cis-alkene, the resulting anhydride might have a certain structure.

2. **The Anhydride's NMR Data**
   The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR. A peak around 7 ppm is usually a proton in an aromatic ring or maybe an alpha proton near carbonyl groups. But since it's a single peak, maybe it's a set of equivalent protons. Wait, for an anhydride, perhaps the protons are on adjacent carbons? Or maybe it's a conjugated system.

   Looking at the 13C NMR, there are two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let's think about typical carbon shifts. 165 ppm is probably a carbonyl carbon, like an ester or anhydride. 137 ppm is around where a carbon next to an oxygen or another electronegative group, maybe a carbonyl, would appear. Perhaps these are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl in the anhydride.

   Let me consider a possible structure. If the anhydride is cyclic, maybe it's a five-membered ring. For example, maleic anhydride has a structure where two carbonyl groups are connected in a ring. The structure is:

       O
       ||
O=C-O-C-O=C
       ||
       O

   Wait, no. That's not right. Maleic anhydride is actually a cyclic structure with two double bonds. Let me visualize it: it's a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The structure is O=C-(C-O)2-C=O, but arranged in a ring. So each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls would be around 137 ppm. The two carbonyls would be at around 165 ppm each, but wait, in 13C NMR, each unique carbon is a separate peak. So in maleic anhydride, there are two carbonyl carbons (each at ~165 ppm) and two carbons adjacent (each at ~137 ppm). But in the data given, the anhydride has only two peaks in 13C. That suggests that maybe each of those carbons is equivalent. So perhaps the anhydride is symmetric, with two carbonyl carbons (but same shift) and two adjacent carbons (same shift). Wait, but maleic anhydride has two different carbons: the two carbons adjacent to the oxygen are each connected to one carbonyl and one oxygen. But in maleic anhydride, the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent because of the symmetry, so their 13C shifts are the same, and the two adjacent carbons are also equivalent. So in that case, the 13C NMR would indeed show two peaks: one at ~165 ppm (the two carbonyls) and another at ~137 ppm (the two adjacent carbons). So that fits.

   So the anhydride is likely maleic anhydride or a similar symmetric anhydride. Then, its 1H NMR would have a peak around 7 ppm, probably due to the protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls. In maleic anhydride, those protons are on the same carbon as the carbonyl and are deshielded. Wait, but in maleic anhydride, the structure is such that the protons are on the same carbon as the carbonyl. Wait, no, wait: the structure has two carbonyl carbons, each connected to an oxygen. The adjacent carbons are each attached to two oxygens. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Maleic anhydride structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds: O=C-(C-O)2-C=O. No, actually, it's more accurately represented as:

        O
        || 
O=C-C-O-C=C
        || 
        O

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, it's a cyclic structure where two carbonyl groups are connected by an oxygen bridge. Maybe better to draw it as:

      O
      ||
C-O-C-O
      ||
      O

But that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

O=C-(CH)2-O-C=O 

Wait, no, that's not cyclic. Maybe the correct structure is a five-membered ring where two carbons are each double-bonded to oxygen. So, the structure is:

O=C-(CH)-O-C-(CH)=C-O

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to look up the structure. Well, I remember that maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride with two double bonds. The structure is such that each of the two carbonyl groups is connected through an oxygen bridge. The protons on the carbons next to the carbonyl are in a cis arrangement. So their 1H NMR would show a peak around 7 ppm, perhaps as a doublet. But in the problem, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the protons of that type are equivalent. So in maleic anhydride, the two protons on each CH2 group are equivalent, so they split into a quartet, but wait, no, in maleic anhydride, each carbon adjacent to the carbonyl has two protons, but in a conjugated system. Wait, perhaps I should look up the 1H NMR of maleic anhydride. From what I remember, the 1H NMR of maleic anhydride shows a peak around 7 ppm as a quartet. But in the problem, the anhydride has a single peak at
