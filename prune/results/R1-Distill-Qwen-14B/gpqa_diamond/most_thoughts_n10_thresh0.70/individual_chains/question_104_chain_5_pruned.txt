Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with similar mass to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the information given is the periodic shift in the spectral line for each star. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. So, the shift in wavelength (which is the milliangstrom value) should be proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some formula. Let me think... I remember the formula K = (v) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between the star and planet.

Wait, the formula I think is K = ( (G * (Mp) ) / ( (Mstar + Mp) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) )) ) ) )^(1/ (something.)) No, maybe I should think about the simplified version because the period is what we need. Oh wait, another approach: the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which in turn is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) ) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) )

But I might be mixing up factors here. Alternatively, another version of the formula I've seen is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, the formula simplifies. Let me get the formula correctly.
