Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, which shifts the spectral lines we observe.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun have planets similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detected spectral line shifts are 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, but the question isn't about the shift itself, but about the orbital periods. I need to find how many times longer planet #2's period is compared to planet #1's.

I think the radial velocity method relates the star's velocity to the planet's orbit. The formula I vaguely recall is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) being proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_star) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) or something like that, but maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the sum of the masses. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, the sum is approximately the star's mass. So P² ∝ a³ / M_star. But here, the stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M is same for both.

But how does the radial velocity shift relate to the period and the mass? Oh, wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by a formula that includes the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the star's mass.

The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than Sun), 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c^3 P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )

Wait, I think a better approach is to consider that the observed Doppler shift (which is the semi-amplitude K) is inversely related to the planet's orbital period for the same planet mass and star mass. Because the star's velocity K depends on the planet's mass and the orbital characteristics.

Alternatively, for the same star mass and planet mass, K is inversely proportional to the orbital period. Because from the formula, K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^{2/3} ) * (1/(P^{1/3})) )

Wait, let me get that straight. The exact formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * (1/c) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Oh, right, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) * (1/(2π)) )

But since e is zero (circular orbit) and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) * (1/(2π c) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the relationship between K and the period. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), so M_p is same for both. So K should be inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because the formula involves K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, let me rephrase. The formula is K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^{2/3}) ) * (1 / (P^{1/3} )) )

Wait, no. Let's think again. The formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1
