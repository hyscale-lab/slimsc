Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm. So the question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds in a detector. The setup is that when particles collide, new particles are produced, and some of these new particles reach the inner walls of the detector. 

The problem says that on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls when the Lorentz factor is around 20. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the walls. The radius of the detector is given as 30 meters.

Wait, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. So particles moving at a high gamma would experience less time, which means their decay time would be shorter in the lab frame. But how does that tie into them reaching the detector walls?

Oh right, the particles are fast-decaying, so their lifetime is important. The proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame) is tau. In the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma times tau. 

But wait, the distance the particles can travel before decaying depends on their velocity and the time they live. So the maximum distance they can go is velocity multiplied by their lifetime. But since they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, maybe we can model it as distance D = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but velocity v is related to gamma as well. Because gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v is approximately c for large gamma. So for ultra-relativistic particles, v ≈ c. So we can approximate D as approximately c * gamma * tau.

But wait, in the problem, the particles are produced at the center of the detector. So the particles move outward, and the detector has a radius R = 30 meters. So if the particle can travel a distance greater than or equal to R before decaying, it would reach the wall. So the fraction that reaches the wall depends on the ratio of D to R.

Wait, no. Because the particles are produced at the center, they have to travel a distance R to reach the wall. So the probability of a particle reaching the wall is the probability that it doesn't decay before traveling R. 

But how is the decay probability connected to the distance? I think it's a
