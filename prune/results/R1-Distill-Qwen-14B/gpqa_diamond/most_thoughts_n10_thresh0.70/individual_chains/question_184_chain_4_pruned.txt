Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize this compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I'm starting with benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 2, 1, and 3 respectively. Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me visualize the structure. Oh right, the numbering goes such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. But wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the directing effects of the substituents. Nitro is a meta-directing group, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group, and the tert-butyl is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group) but it's probably a para director because of its size.

Wait, but the substituents are in specific positions. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's number the positions: the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Wait, does that make sense in
