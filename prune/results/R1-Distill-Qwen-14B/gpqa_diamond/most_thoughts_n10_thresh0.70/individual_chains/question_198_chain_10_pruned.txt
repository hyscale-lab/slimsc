Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stability constants can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. They've given the stability constants (β) for the complexes up to the fourth one. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ ion, right? Because dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The blue one is the one with two SCN- ligands, which would be the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. Is that correct? Or is it another one? I think I've heard that the blue color is for the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So that's the third species, maybe? Or second? Let me think.

Wait, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β usually represents the formation constant, Kf, which is for each step. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So the complexes would be:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN²+ (β1=9)
CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2=40)
Co(SCN)₂²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₃²+ (β3=63)
Co(SCN)₃²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₄²− (β4=16)

So the fourth complex is [Co(SCN)₄]^2−, right? But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)₂]²+ complex. So that's the second complex, but wait, no. Wait, the first complex is monothiocyanato (one SCN), the second is dithiocyanato (two SCN), the third is tri, and the fourth is tetra. So the β2 is 40, which is for the second step. So the β3 is 63 for the third step.

Wait, no.
