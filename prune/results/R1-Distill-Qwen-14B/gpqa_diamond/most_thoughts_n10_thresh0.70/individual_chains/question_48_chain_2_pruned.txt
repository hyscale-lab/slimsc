Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Then, each product is formed through different reagents, and finally, we're supposed to find out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with one ketone group. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1. Bromine in what conditions? I think bromine can undergo different reactions depending on the setup. Oh, wait, cyclohexanone reacting with bromine is likely an addition reaction. So, cyclohexanone has a ketone group, which is a good site for nucleophilic addition. But wait, bromine is more often used for allylic bromination or maybe as an electrophilic addition.

Wait, no, wait. Another possibility: perhaps it's a bromination via enol formation. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. If we treat it with a brominating agent, maybe it adds across the carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. Oh wait, when ketones react with HBr, they form bromohydrins, but that's typically with HBr, not bromine. Alternatively, if it's an addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, but that's usually for aldehydes and ketones, but cyclohexanone's carbonyl is in a ring. So maybe it's a bromine addition to the ring, but that doesn't make much sense because cyclohexanone is a ketone, not aromatic.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction? No, that's with dienes and dienophiles. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a reaction where the ketone is converted into a bromo compound. Let me think again: cyclohexanone plus bromine (Br2) might lead to the addition of Br across the carbonyl. But wait, ketones don't add Br2 in the same way alkenes do. Or wait
