Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in relativity, things get a bit tricky because you can't just add velocities like you normally would. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. And for energy, I think it's the sum of their relativistic energies.

Wait, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, all in the positive x-direction. So I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy.

First, let me tackle the relative speed. I remember that when you add velocities in special relativity, you don't just do a simple addition. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)). But wait, wait. Oh no, wait. Wait, no, that's when you have one frame moving at u relative to another, and an object moving at v in the first frame. The relative speed in the second frame would be that formula. But in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed between them is not just the difference of their speeds. Because the astronauts are moving in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of the slower one (0.5c) would be the faster one minus the slower one, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. Let me clarify. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So in the Earth frame, A is ahead of B because he's moving faster. So from B's perspective, what's the speed of A? Because from B's frame, he's at rest, and A is moving away at some speed. So I need to calculate the relative speed of A as seen from B.

So using the velocity addition formula. The formula for relative velocity u' when observed from a frame moving at speed v relative to the original frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, no. Wait: the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because if the original frame has an object moving at u, and the observer is moving at v relative to the original frame, then the object's speed in the observer's frame is (u - v)/(1
