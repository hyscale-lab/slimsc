Okay, so I have this question about creating a mouse embryonic chimera using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Hmm, let's break this down. The question is about what the first thing I would notice when tracking the iPSCs in the embryo.

Alright, the setup: The iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter. So mRaspberry is a red fluorescent protein, right? And each cell type has its own promoter, which means the red label will only show up in specific cell lineages. They injected these dedifferentiated cells into a 32-cell stage blastocyst, which is the stage just before implantation. Then, they track them over 48 hours, every 12 hours, using TUNEL-FITC staining and confocal microscopy.

Wait, what's TUNEL? TUNEL stands for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. It's a method used to detect DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. So when a cell is undergoing apoptosis, it undergoes DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL can label the nuclei. FITC is a green fluorescent dye, so the TUNEL-positive cells would show up green under the microscope.

The question is about the first observation. So what's happening when the iPSCs are injected into the blastocyst?

In a chimera, the injected cells should integrate into the embryo and start contributing to various tissues, depending on their lineage. Since they're iPSCs, they have the potential to differentiate into various cell types.

Wait, but the iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry under lineage-specific promoters. So each iPSC line will express red in specific cell types. For example, maybe one line is for neurons, another for liver cells, etc. So when the embryo develops, each cell type shows up red based on their lineage.

Now, when they do TUNEL-FITC, which looks for apoptosis. Apoptosis is a normal part of development; cells die at various stages as the embryo develops and organs form.

The question is, what happens when they look under the confocal? Do the red signals (iPSC-derived cells) colocalize with green TUNEL signals (apoptotic cells)?

Hmm, I remember that during embryogenesis, especially in the early stages, there's a lot of cell death. But iPSCs are totipotent or pluripotent, so they can contribute to many tissues. But wait, if the iPSCs are successfully contributing to the embryo, their labeled cells would be in various places. However, during the process of integration, maybe some of these cells are undergoing apoptosis as well.

So when they look at the embryo, they might see green (apoptotic cells) and red (iPSC-derived cells) signals. But what's the first thing they notice? Maybe whether the red and green signals are colocalizing.

Option B says green colocalizes with red. Option C says no green. But why wouldn't there be green?

Wait, the TUNEL is applied every 12 hours. At 48 hours, that's two days after injection. Maybe by that time, some iPSCs have started to differentiate, and some of
