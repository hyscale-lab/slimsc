Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. The problem gives me the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 as about 2.3. Also, the mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1, given that all have the same albedo of 0.3, similar to Earth.

The options are A) ~10.4, B) ~3.2, C) ~4.4, D) ~33.4.

Hmm. I remember that the equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is Te = [ (L / (16πσ)) * (1 - a) / (d^2) ]^0.25, where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, d is the distance, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since all have same albedo, a=0.3, that cancels out when taking ratios.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets is (d1/d2)^-0.5. Because if you take Te1/Te2 = (sqrt(d2/d1)) ), since Te is proportional to (d)^-0.5. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, equilibrium temperature equation is:

Te = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^0.25.

So when comparing two planets, say Planet1 and Planet2, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (d2/d1) )^(0.5), perhaps? Wait, wait, let me do the math.

Te1 / Te2 = [ (L/(16πσ)) (1-a)/(d1²) ) / ( same terms for d2² ) ]^0.25.

So the L, (1-a), and constants all cancel out. So we get (d2²/d1²)^0.25. Which is (d2/d1)^(1/2). So Te1/Te2 = (d2/d1)^0.5. Hmm, because when you take the ratio, (d2²/d1²) is (d2/d1)^2, and the 0.25 power makes it (d2/d1)^(0.5) = sqrt(d2/d1).

Wait, so if Te1/Te2 = sqrt( d2/d1 ), then (Te1/Te2)^2 = d2/d1. So d2 = d1 * (Te1/Te2)^2. 

Wait let me double-check: Let's say I have Te1 = Te for planet 1, Te2 = Te for planet 2.

Te1 = [ ... / d1² ]^0.25
Te2 = [ ... / d2² ]^0.25

Taking the ratio Te1/Te2 = (d2²/d1²)^0.25 = (d2/d1)^(0.5).

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( d2/d1 ) → d2 = d1 * (Te1/Te2)^2.

So yes, that's correct.

In the problem, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So Te1/Te2 = 1.4. So using the formula, d2 = d1 * (1.4)^2.

Wait wait no, wait: Wait, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( d2/d1 ). So if Te1/Te2 is 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt( d2/d1 ) → square both sides: d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 → d2/d1 = 1.96 → d2 = 1.96 * d1.

So Planet2 is about 1.96 times as far from the star as Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Te2/Te3 = 2.3. So Te2/Te3 = sqrt( d3/d2 ). Because Te2 is equilibrium temp of Planet2, Te3 is Planet3.

So,
