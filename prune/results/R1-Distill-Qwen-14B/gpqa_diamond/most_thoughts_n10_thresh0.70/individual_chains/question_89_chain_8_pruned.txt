Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a really rigid cage structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has two bromine atoms attached to adjacent carbons in this structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. Oh wait, KOH is a strong base. When dibromides react with bases, they usually undergo an elimination reaction, like E2. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons, maybe it will eliminate twice, leading to a diene? Or maybe each Br leaves, but wait, that's more likely to form a di-elimination product. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is removed in separate steps.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically eliminate to form alkenes through dehydrohalogenation. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a 1,3-dihalide, maybe it's a similar situation. But wait, 1,3 positions are not adjacent; they're separated by a carbon. So maybe each elimination leads to a double bond each? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the base removes one Br, causing a hydride shift or something else. Hmm, I might need to think about this.

Wait, let me think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid. I recall that when vicinal dihalides (adjacent) eliminate, they form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane's structure might allow for two eliminations to form a conjugated diene. So maybe two E2 reactions happen, each removing a Br and a hydrogen, forming two double bonds next to each other. That would make a diene, perhaps a conjugated diene.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester. Wait, but the product is formed from an elimination with KOH, which usually forms alkenes. But the IR here shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone. Hmm, maybe I mixed up the reaction.

Wait another thought: perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Alternatively, KOH could induce a ring-opening if the adamantane structure has some strain. But I think adamantane is pretty stable. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination followed by some rearrangement. Wait, but the NMR shows a peak around 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a region typical for maybe an -OH group, but wait, after elimination, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, an epoxide's protons are usually around 3.5-4.5, but in a different region. Or maybe it's an ether? Alternatively
