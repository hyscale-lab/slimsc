Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has this diamondoid structure, so maybe it's a cage-like molecule. The first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, right? So probably an elimination reaction is happening here. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo) react with a base, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So from two bromines on adjacent carbons, we lose HBr twice and form a double bond. So the product after KOH would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that? Wait, wait, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, each from adjacent carbons. So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C3? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings in a diamond structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Brs on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When KOH is added, each Br leaves with a base, taking a proton from adjacent C. So the elimination would form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps 1,2-diene? Hmm, maybe I should check the NMR data given.

The 1H NMR for product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Wait, IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group? But I thought it was elimination to form an alkene. Hmm, maybe I got the reaction wrong.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Another possibility is that the reaction is a substitution. KOH could cause a substitution, but with two bromines, it's more likely elimination. But wait, another thought: sometimes with vicinal dihalides, especially when using a strong base like KOH, you can get a diepoxide or perhaps a ketone? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, if the structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe it's a bridge structure, and when treated with a base, each Br is removed, forming a double bond. But then where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Another possibility is that the dihalide undergoes a Hofmann elimination or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a neighboring group participation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. How does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Another angle: perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but instead a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, not a nucleophile. Oh wait, KOH can also act as a nucleophile in substitution reactions, but for that, the leaving group needs to be good, like bromide. But in a vicinal dihalide, if the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, perhaps upon treatment with KOH, each Br leaves, but with a shift in the structure leading to ring contraction or expansion. Alternatively, maybe a pinacol-like elimination? Wait, pinacol is when vicinal diols lose water to form ketones. But here, it's dihalides reacting, so maybe a similar process. Pinacol rearrangement involves diols eliminating water to form a carbonyl. So perhaps the dihalide would eliminate two equivalents of HBr and form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, could lose two HBr molecules, forming a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Wait, perhaps if the initial elimination leads to a structure that undergoes a rearrangement, like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which involves carbocation shifts. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the initial product is a diene, but then another reaction occurs, like oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dihalide upon treatment with KOH undergoes a double elimination to form a ketone. So, for example, each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a carbocation, which then combines. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates, leading to a formation of a carbene or something. Not sure.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data. Product 1's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet for two hydrogens. What could that be? Maybe an -OCH2- group or a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, a ketone adjacent to a CH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 multiplet (10H) suggests perhaps some equivalent methylene or methine protons, perhaps in a bridged structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, considering the IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a diket
