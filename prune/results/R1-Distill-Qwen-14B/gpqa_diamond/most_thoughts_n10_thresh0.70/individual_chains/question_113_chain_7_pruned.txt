Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question says that I've prepared an unknown compound and used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The data from these techniques is given, and I have to choose the correct chemical formula from the options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Alright, I'll start by breaking down each piece of data and see what information I can extract.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Wait, 1700 is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. But since 1700 is more indicative of a carbonyl, maybe it's something like a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is another type of group, like an amide or an aromatic C=C stretch? Hmm, but the presence of both 1700 and 1650 is a bit confusing. Wait, another thought: the 1700 could be an ester or ketone, while the 1650 could be a conjugated C=O, like in a conjugated ester or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in an aromatic C=C stretch, which is usually around 1450-1600. Oh wait, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a carbonyl group that's conjugated, which might lower the wavenumber a bit. For example, conjugated esters or ketones might have lower wavenumbers. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. That makes sense. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups or a conjugated system involving a carbony
