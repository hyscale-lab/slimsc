Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit it. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when a compound has chiral centers, making them non-superimposable mirror images, right? So each of these compounds might have that or not.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. Oh, right, biphenyls can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, we're talking about stereoisomerism due to spatial arrangement. So if the substituents are in positions that allow for E/Z isomerism or maybe some kind of axial chirality. Oh wait, biphenyls can have something called meso compounds or maybe have stereogenic centers. Let me think. Wait, the substituents here are at 2 and 2' positions on each phenyl ring, and the nitro groups are at 6 and 6'. So each ring has two substituents. Are the substituents arranged in a way that creates a chiral center? Hmm, not directly, but wait, the biphenyl linkage itselfâ€”could that lead to axial chirality?

I remember that biphenyl compounds can have what's called a biphenyl axis, and if the substituents are arranged in a non-superimposable way around that axis, then they can be chiral. So if each ring has substituents in positions that make the whole molecule chiral, then it would have optical isomers. So in this case, since the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps the molecule is chiral. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetrical, it might not be chiral. Let me visualize the structure.
