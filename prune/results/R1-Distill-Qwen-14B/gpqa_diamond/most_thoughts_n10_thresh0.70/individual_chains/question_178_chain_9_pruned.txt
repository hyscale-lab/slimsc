Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question gives the Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that γ matrices are part of the Dirac equation, so this must be a fermionic interaction term.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I think the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian must be 4 because the action is dimensionless and we integrate over four spacetime dimensions. Wait, no, wait. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over d^4x, which has dimension -4 in mass units (since each derivative is mass dimension 1, and x is inverse mass), the whole action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in L_int should have dimension 4. Let me break down the components:

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

Let's find the dimension of each part.

1. ψ is the Dirac spinor. I remember that in 4 dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (i γ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so ψ must have dimension 3/2 to make the equation dimensionally consistent.

So ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimensions (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. But wait, σ is a product of gamma matrices and derivatives? Or wait, no. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not operators with derivatives. So σ_{μν} is just a tensor made from the gamma matrices and has no mass dimension on its own. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3.

Wait, but wait. No, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, and each γ is dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is just a tensor, but dimensionless. So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something. F is made from derivatives of the gauge field A. Specifically, F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. Each derivative is dimension 1, so F has dimension 2. Because each A is a gauge field; in four dimensions, the gauge field
