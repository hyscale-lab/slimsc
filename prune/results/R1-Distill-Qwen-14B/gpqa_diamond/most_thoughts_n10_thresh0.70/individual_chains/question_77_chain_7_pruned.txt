Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has two parts, A and B, each resulting from a different reaction. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Oh wait, that's a mouthful. So, breaking it down, it's a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an OCH2 group, right? And the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Let me draw that. Butene is four carbons. The substituent is on carbon 3, so but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2? Wait, but that's four carbons. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, but the substituent is 3-methyl, so the butenyl is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-, but wait, the butenyl is 1 position. So the substituent is on the 1st carbon of the butenyl. So maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CH2-benzene.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure more clearly. The main chain is benzene, attached to OCH2-. The O is connected to a butenyl group: the butenyl is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-, but wait, that's three carbons. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is four carbons, correct? So the structure is:

The group is O-(CH2) connected to a butenyl. The butenyl is CH2-CH2-CH-CH2, but with a double bond between C2
