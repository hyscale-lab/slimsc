Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what I remember and how I can piece this together.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C spectrum. Hmm, what does that tell me about the structure?

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak integrating for a certain number of protons. Since it's a single peak, maybe it's a singlet, and the protons are equivalent. For an anhydride, the carbonyl groups are usually around 165-185 ppm in 13C. So the 165 ppm peak is probably a carbonyl carbon. The 137 ppm is likely a carbon attached to oxygen, maybe an aromatic ring? Or perhaps from an alkene or something else.

Wait, but the starting material was a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride, so maybe it's cyclic? Another possibility is that the anhydride is symmetrical because the 1H NMR has only one peak, which suggests all the hydrogen environments are equivalent. If the anhydride is symmetrical, perhaps it's a structure like succinic anhydride, but wait, no, that's a five-membered ring. Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So, maybe something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond. Wait, no. Wait, the original molecule has a cis-alkene. So, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, the double bond would be between the two CH2s. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2
