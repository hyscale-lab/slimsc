Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup gives me that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h divided by 4π. And S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). 

First, I think I should write down what the matrix Ay looks like. Let me compute that. So c is h/(4π), right? So Ay = (h/4π) * S. Since S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], multiplying by c gives Ay as [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],[i*(h/(4π)), 0]]. Wait, actually, let me compute each element:

For the (1,1) element: 0 * c = 0.
(1,2): -i * c = -i*(h/(4π)).
(2,1): i * c = i*(h/(4π)).
(2,2): 0 * c = 0.

So Ay is a 2x2 matrix with these elements.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Remember, eigenvalues are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. 

Let's set that up. The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a    (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ].

So determinant = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²/(16π²)) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes (1) * (h²/(16π²)).

So determinant is a² - (h²/(16π²)) = 0.

So equation: a² = h²/(16π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, h is Planck's constant, right? So h/(4π) is actually ħ/2 because ħ = h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

But wait, looking at the options, I should check what they say about the eigenvalues. Let me look.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, but our eigenvalues are real, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian. Wait is Ay Hermitian? Let me check. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose.

Ay is:

Row 1: 0, -i (h/(4π))
Row 2: i (h/(4π)), 0

So its conjugate transpose would have row
