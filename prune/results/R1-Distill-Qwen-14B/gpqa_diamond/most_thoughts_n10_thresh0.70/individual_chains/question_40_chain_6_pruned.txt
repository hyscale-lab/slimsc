Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry question. Let's read it again. Hmm, two chemists are talking, and one says his compounds are "on top of each other." The question is what does that mean.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the context. So maybe it's about a lab situation. The first chemist is asking how the work went, and the second says it didn't go well because his compounds are on top of each other. I'm thinking about what that phrase implies.

I remember in some lab settings, when things are on top of each other, it might relate to how substances separate or layer in a mixture. Like during a distillation or when using chromatography. If the compounds are on top of each other, maybe they aren't separating properly. So they're either forming layers or perhaps not moving apart in a column.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's about their physical states. If the compounds have similar boiling points, they might condense together when distilled. So during a distillation process, if two substances have similar boiling points, they might come out as a mixture instead of separate layers. So when you collect the distillate, they're together, not separated.

Alternatively, if the compounds have similar polarities, they might interact more, but that might not directly cause them to be on top of each other. Or perhaps if they have similar optical rotations, that's more about their physical properties but not their separation.

Wait, another angle: maybe the compounds are forming azeotropes if their boiling points are close. That would make
