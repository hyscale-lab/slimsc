Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out how many loops a Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, okay, let me think step by step.

The question mentions that my colleague has a Feynman diagram with a "size estimate" written next to it. The expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that in quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams are used to represent interactions, and the number of loops is related to the complexity of the diagram and, in turn, the order in perturbation theory.

Wait, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of the coupling constant or something like that. Also, loop integrals often come with factors involving pi and powers, maybe from the integration over loop momenta. The denominator in the given expression has (4pi)^6. Oh, right, because in dimensional regularization or other methods, loop integrals can result in factors like (4π)^epsilon, especially in the context of renormalization and loop expansions.

Let me think about the general structure of Feynman diagrams and their contributions. Each loop typically adds a factor proportional to (4π)^something. Wait, but more importantly, the number of loops is linked to the number of vertices and propagators, but perhaps I should think about the superficial degree of divergence or how loop integrals contribute to the overall scaling.

Wait, but the expression given is an estimate of the size, which probably comes from the loop integral. So, the expression likely represents the scaling with various constants. Let me break down each part.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4πε_0 ħ c), but in natural units, it's e^2/(4πħ). So alpha is proportional to e^2/(4π). But in loop integrals, each loop brings in a factor of (4π)^something, maybe?

Let me think about the general form of loop integrals. For a loop diagram with L loops, the integral typically has a dependence like (4π)^{-L} times some factors, because in four dimensions, each loop integral in the perturbation series contributes a factor from the integration over d^4k, which in dimensional regularization becomes (4π)^{d/2 - L} or something like that. Wait, maybe that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps each loop contributes a 1/(4π)^{something} factor, depending on the number of loops.

Wait, considering the given expression: 1/(4pi)^6. So that's (4π)^{-6}. So if each loop contributes a (4π)^{-something}, and here it's (4pi)^-6, then we can maybe find the number of loops from that.

But wait, other factors could also contribute. The (Q/M)^2 term: Q is a momentum scale, M is perhaps a mass scale. So that's a dimensionless ratio. Alpha^3 would be (e^2/(4π))^3, perhaps. G squared is another coupling, maybe a gauge coupling or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall scaling with energy. The general scaling for a loop diagram
