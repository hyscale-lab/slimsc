Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

I think I should first write out what this matrix looks like. The standard basis for qubits is |0⟩ and |1⟩. So |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the bottom-right corner. Adding them together would give a diagonal matrix with 1's on both diagonal elements. Then, multiplying by 1/2 gives 1/2 on the diagonal. So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. That's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal.

I remember that density matrices for qubits can be represented as points in a 3-dimensional space (the Bloch sphere), but wait, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation for pure states, right? Wait, no, actually, the density matrices can be mapped to vectors if they are 2x2. Let me think about that.

The density matrix ρ can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices, maybe? I recall that any 2x2 density matrix can be expressed as (I + r · σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. Oh right, that's the Bloch vector approach. So this would represent a mixed state as a point inside the unit sphere (Bloch ball). For a pure state, r would have length 1, and for a mixed state, it's somewhere inside.

So let's try to express ρ in that form. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute ρ. Each of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors, so adding them gives a matrix with 1's on the diagonal. So ρ is the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2, because I = |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|, so 1/2 I would be [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]] as I thought earlier.

Now, the general form for a density matrix is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So let's set ρ equal to that and see what r is.

So, (I + r·σ)/2 = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Let me compute the right side. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you add r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z, you get a matrix with elements:

- The (1,1) element is r_z.

- The (1,2) element is r_x - i r_y.

- The (2,1) element is r_x + i r_y.

- The (2,2) element is -r_z.

So putting it all together, (I + r·σ)/2 becomes [ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ].

Now, our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Comparing these, let's equate the off-diagonal elements first. The (1,2) element of ρ is 0. So (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. Similarly, the (2,1) element is 0, so (r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0.

Setting r_x - i r_y = 0 and r_x + i r_y = 0. Let me solve these equations. Adding both equations, 2 r_x = 0 → r_x = 0. Substituting r_x=0 into the first equation, -i r_y = 0 → r_y=0. So both r_x and r_y are zero.

Now, the diagonal elements: (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5. So 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0. Similarly, the other diagonal element is (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → same result, r_z=0.

So the vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the 3D space. So the density matrix is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because it's a completely mixed state. A completely mixed state has equal probabilities for both |0⟩ and |1⟩, which is what this density matrix represents.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be written explicitly as:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a qubit, where the probabilities of being in states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) are equal. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch vector representation. Any density matrix for a qubit can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Substituting \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\) into this expression, we find that the off-diagonal terms vanish (\(r_x = 0, r_y = 0\)) and the diagonal terms give \(r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

This result aligns with the fact that the given density matrix represents a completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
