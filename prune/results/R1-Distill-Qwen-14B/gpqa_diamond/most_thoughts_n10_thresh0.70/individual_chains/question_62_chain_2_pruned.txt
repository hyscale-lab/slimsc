Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target compound. So, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, that sounds like a cyclohexane ring attached to a methyl group which is also attached to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane. And then, on the cyclohexane part, there's a carbaldehyde group. So, I imagine the molecule has two cyclohexane rings: one is the main ring, and the other is attached via a methyl group with an OH and another cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. So, the main cyclohexane has a substituent: a methyl group (-CH2-) attached to it. That methyl is connected to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl) and a hydroxyl group (OH). So the methyl is like a bridge between two cyclohexanes and has an OH. Then, on the main cyclohexane, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached.

So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH3 group? Or wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH2 group or something else? Wait, no. Ethynyl is -C≡C- group. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a triple bond substituent, like CH2-C≡CH attached to the ring? Or maybe it's cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH3 substituent? Hmm, I think it's more likely that ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH.

Wait, but ethynyl is an al
