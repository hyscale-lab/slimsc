Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, also known as SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are various combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is built as an effective theory, which means it's constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are organized by their dimension, with each operator being a product of fields and derivatives. The whole idea is that SMEFT should reproduce the Standard Model at low energies but include all possible corrections from new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Now, about symmetries. I recall that for any quantum field theory, certain fundamental symmetries must be satisfied. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so what symmetries are built-in?

Lorentz symmetry: Well, all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. Because, in the Standard Model, all terms respect Lorentz symmetry. Effective operators, being part of the same framework, should also maintain this. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must.

Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Hmm. Wait, I think SMEFT is invariant under the Poincare group because it's a quantum field theory. But wait, the question is whether all operators must respect it. Or maybe Poincare isn't an additional symmetry beyond Lorentz. Because some sources might say that all operators in SMEFT are required to respect Lorentz and gauge symmetries, but Poincare is more about the spacetime symmetries. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if all operators are Lorentz invariant, and the effective theory is built in a way that respects translations (so you can move the origin), then they would respect Poincare. But I think in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in such a way that the theory is Lorentz invariant, but the question is whether Poincare is also required. Alternatively, maybe the effective theory doesn't need to explicitly require Poin
