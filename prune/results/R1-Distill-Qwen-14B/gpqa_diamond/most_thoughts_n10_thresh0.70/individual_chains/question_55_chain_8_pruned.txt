Okay, so I need to figure out which compound this is based on the given NMR data. Let's see, the options are all propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. I remember that the structure of these compounds will affect the NMR signals, especially the splitting patterns.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR signals are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). Hmm, I need to break this down.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet integrating for 3H. That's probably the acetate group's methyl (OAc) since those usually show up around 2 ppm as a singlet. So there's an ester group here.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH group. Wait, since it's a doublet, maybe it's attached to a CH that's part of a double bond or near one.

The 5.5 ppm signal is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). That's a bit tricky. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. High coupling like 16 Hz usually suggests a trans double bond. Wait, in NMR, when you have a doublet with a large coupling constant (like 16 Hz), that's often between two vinylic protons on a double bond. So maybe this is a trans arrangement because the coupling is large.

Let me think about the structures. Both propenyl and butenyl have double bonds. Acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acetate is OAc. So it's R-O-COCH3. So the R group is either propenyl or butenyl, and whether they're cis or trans.

So, for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. But wait, propenyl has three carbons with a double bond. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, considering the configuration, cis would have the substituents on the same side, and trans on opposite.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling between the protons. Let me sketch possible structures.

Assuming butenyl acetate: the R group is CH2CH2CHCH2, but that's butenyl. Wait, butenyl is four carbons, so for example, CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc but with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? Or CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc? Not sure. Wait, butenyl is four carbons, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? Or perhaps the double bond is in a different position. Alternatively, maybe it's more like CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a
