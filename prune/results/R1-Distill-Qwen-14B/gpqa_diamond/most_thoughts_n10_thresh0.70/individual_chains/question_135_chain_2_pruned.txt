Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is about the allowed decays of a boson X at the lowest order. The Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if I need to focus on that. The mass of the boson is 6 GeV. Wait, the options are different decay channels, so I think I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into based on some criteria.

Wait, bosons can decay into fermions if the Lagrangian allows it, right? The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not too familiar with that notation. Let's see, maybe it's a Yukawa interaction term. The standard Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson field. So in this case, the interaction is between the boson X and some fermion fields.

So, the term would mediate interactions where X is emitted or absorbed by fermions. So when X decays, it can decay into pairs of fermions, provided the energy is sufficient.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be at least equal to the sum of the masses of the decay products. Otherwise, the decay isn't kinematically allowed.

Wait, but what about the masses of the possible fermions? For example, b quarks are heavy, so if X's mass is 6 GeV, can it decay into b quarks? Let me think about the masses.

The top quark is the he
