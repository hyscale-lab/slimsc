Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, that looks a bit like a Yukawa interaction, where the boson X couples to fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy, right? So the rest mass of the boson X has to be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into because each fermion pair would require their rest mass energy. So I'll need to look at the masses of possible fermion pairs.

But wait, the fermions in the Lagrangian are ψ_f. What kind of fermions are these? The term λf suggests that f is a fermion field. So the interaction is between X and a particular type of fermion, right? Or perhaps it's a general coupling to all fermions?

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, maybe that's a typo, and it's meant to be something like -λ ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So X is interacting with fermions ψ_f, and the coupling is λ. So the interaction term would allow X to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that's allowed by the interaction term. But wait, whether a decay is kinematically allowed depends on whether the mass of X is enough to produce the pair.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, for a fermion pair, each particle has mass m, so the total mass is 2m. So 2m ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So
