Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

Okay, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii are in a 1.5 times ratio, same with their masses. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and the same goes for the mass. The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm. Oh, wait no, the question says they computed the luminosities assuming black body radiation. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the luminosity calculation here. Or does it? Because when you calculate luminosity from a star's spectrum, you'd account for its velocity via the Doppler shift, right? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength can shift, affecting the flux measurements.

Wait, but the problem says they found the peak wavelengths are the same. So maybe the Doppler effect is already accounted for, which would mean the observed peak wavelengths are the same, implying that the intrinsic temperatures are the same. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rest frame of the stars, so that their temperatures are the same. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.

The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, so their luminosity would depend on their radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth.

But wait, in the question, they calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater
