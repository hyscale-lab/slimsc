Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Then, their radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. And the options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm, so first, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies, which aligns with that formula. So I need to find the ratio of their luminosities, L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² is (1.5)^2 R2², which is 2.25 R2². So that's the R part squared.

But the tricky part is the temperature. The problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Wait, no, no, if λ_max is same, then T is same because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So T1 = T2. So their temperatures are equal.

Wait, does that make sense? Because typically, a larger star could be hotter or not, but in this case, the peak wavelength is the same, which implies same temperature.

So if T1 = T2, then the L ratio would be (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) which is (2.25) * (1) = 2.25 times. So that would make Star_1's luminosity 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait, the options have 2.25 as option A, but option B is 2.32, which is higher. So why is that?

Wait, maybe there's something I'm missing. Oh wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. How does that come into play?

I remember that radial velocity can affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Since Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength might shift. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed peak wavelength, so the actual temperatures might not be the same as they appear.

Wait, no, I think the question states
