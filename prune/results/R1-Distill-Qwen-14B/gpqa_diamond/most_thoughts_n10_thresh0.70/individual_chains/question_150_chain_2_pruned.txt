Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's start by going through the information step by step. 

The compound has a molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2. Let's compute that: (18-9 +1)=10, so 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which accounts for 4) and a double bond or a ring and some other double bonds. 

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm triplet (t, 1H): That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, a triplet? Aldehyde protons are usually singlets. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic proton with a neighboring coupling? Hmm, not sure. Maybe a conjugated aldehyde? Or perhaps an enol tautomer? Not sure yet.
- 6.98 ppm doublet (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted ring. So two protons as a doublet.
- 6.51 ppm doublet (d, 2H): Another aromatic set, maybe ortho or meta, but again, perhaps another para-substituted ring.
- 6.27 ppm broad singlet (bs, 2H): Broad could indicate exchange with protons, like an -OH group or maybe an amine. But wait, the molecular formula has an N, but the NMR doesn't show a peak integrating for it. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO, so there's an O and an N. Wait, the NMR shows a peak at 3.66 ppm, which is a d (doublet, 2H). That could be a methylene group attached to something electronegative. Maybe an OCH2 or NCH2 group. 

Wait, but the initial structure would have to account for all these signals. Let me think. 

So, the aldehyde at 9.72 ppm. Then, two doublets
