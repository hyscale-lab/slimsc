Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have carbonyl groups, so that's a big clue. The ester functional group (C=O) would show a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ usually. Got it.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let me break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm. So, the aromatic protons aren't all equivalent, which makes sense because it's di-substituted. Wait, but in a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would be equivalent and give a single peak. If they're in the ortho or meta positions, the symmetry breaks, leading to two types of aromatic protons. But wait, the compound is di-substituted, so maybe the substituents are such that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring isn't symmetric, causing each proton to be unique. But wait, the NMR shows two signals, so perhaps two sets of aromatic protons, each set being equivalent. So maybe the substituents are in the para position, leading to two types of aromatic Hs (ortho and meta to each substituent?), but perhaps it's a different substitution pattern. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a way that creates two sets of Hs. I'll have to think about that.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, like in an alkene. So, these would be the Hs attached to the carbons of a double bond. The first is a doublet, which suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. The second is a doublet of quartets, which is more complex. Maybe that's a trans coupling or something with more neighbors. Wait, but vinyl groups in different environments can cause different splitting. For example, if the vinyl group is part of an
