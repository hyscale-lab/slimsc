Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming a new bond and creating a resonance-stabilized intermediate, which then maybe loses a leaving group or something.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. So, I think dimethyl malonate is the enolate donor here because it's a good nucleophile. Wait, no, actually wait. In the Michael reaction, the enolate is the nucleophile, right? So the enolate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acceptor).

Wait, so the dimethyl malonate would act as the donor. Let me think. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. When deprotonated, it forms an enolate which is a strong nucleophile. The acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has an alpha-beta unsaturated ester group.

So the structure of the acceptor is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with the E configuration and the substituent at the 3-position being p-tolyl. Wait, no, the structure is more like CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with the substituent (p-tolyl) on the acrylate. Oh wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but in this case, the 3-position is substituted with p-tolyl. So it's something like CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is
