Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question presents three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C. I need to determine the major products for each. The options are given, but I should work through each reaction individually to find the correct products.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. It can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. The E configuration means the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it adds to the beta carbon (the CH2 part of CH2=CH...). That should form a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha of the malonate and the beta of the acrylate.

The product after the Michael addition would be a new compound where the malonate's enolate adds to the acrylate. Then, considering the elimination of the leaving groupâ€”wait, or is it a simple addition? Let's think: Michael addition is a conjugate addition, so the product is a beta-substituted product.

So, after the addition, the structure would have the p-tolyl group connected via a chain. The new compound would have three carbons: the p-tolyl group, then the added part from malonate, and the ester groups from dimethyl malonate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. When it loses one equivalent of COOCH3 as the leaving group? No, wait. The Michael addition leads to a new carbon-carbon bond, and then the alpha hydrogens would be abstracted again. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing steps here.

Alternatively, perhaps once the enolate attacks, the product forms a new six-membered ring intermediate, but I think for this reaction, it's a simple addition followed by protonation or something else.

Wait, another approach: the product should be a triester. Because dimethyl malonate has two methyl esters and a central CH that gets added to the acrylate. When it adds, the two ester groups would remain, and the new group would add a third ester? Or wait, no, the acrylate is methyl, so the product would have three ester groups.

Wait, no. Let me sketch it out mentally.
