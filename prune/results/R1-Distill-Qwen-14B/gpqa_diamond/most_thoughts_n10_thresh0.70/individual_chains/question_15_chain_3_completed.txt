Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which one has a higher probability of transiting. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

They both have circular orbits, which I think simplifies the calculations a bit because eccentricity isn't a factor here.

Now, the host stars. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, same size but different masses. I know that more massive stars are usually larger, but in this case, their radii are equal. Maybe they're similar in size but one is more massive, perhaps a younger star or something.

The question is about the probability of transit. I recall that the probability (P) is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (a * sin i)), but wait, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Oh, right, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet and star, and the alignment of the orbit. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that term drops out. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * sin i)), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for the transit probability. The probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star and the inclination of the orbit. The formula I think is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since e=0, that's just (R_p / R_s)^2. Wait, no—that's not quite right. Another factor is the impact parameter 'b', which relates to the alignment. The probability is actually the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The probability of a transit occurrence is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2, but that's not the whole story. The other factor involves the orbital distance. Hmm.

I remember the formula for the transit probability (assuming circular orbits) is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (sin i), where i is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But wait, no, that's not correct because sin i is part of the geometric probability. Oh, wait, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The geometric probability is (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a)^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the formula. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh right, the geometric probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough to cause a transit) is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - (R_p / R_s)^2))^(1/2). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the transit probability (the chance of a transit happening in a given orbit) is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (a * sin i)) ) but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the key factors here are the planet-to-star size ratio and the orbital distance. Because a planet that's closer to the star would have a smaller orbit, making transits more probable? No, wait, the transit probability is about the alignment. The closer the planet, the higher the chance that its orbital plane is aligned with ours, because the orbital plane's orientation is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, no. The transit probability is more about whether the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The actual distance from the star affects the orbital speed and the RV method, but for transit probability, it's about the geometry.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the formula again. The transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - e^2)) )^(1/2) × (1 / (a sin i)) ) but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no. Another approach: the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance in the plane of the sky. The impact parameter b is the distance of the planet's path from the center of the star. For a transit to occur, b must be less than R_p + R_s.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think that the probability of a transit is the ratio of the area where the planet's path would cause a transit to the total possible area. The area where the planet would transit is a circle with radius R_p + R_s. The total possible area is the area of the sky where the planet could be, which depends on the star's position. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the key factors are the planet's orbital distance (a) and the star's radius (R_s). The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a^2). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a sin i)) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this from the transit probability formula. The probability P that a planet transits is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2))

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by 1/(a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but that can't be right because the units don't match.

Alternatively, I remember that for a circular orbit, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (a sin i)), but again, not confident.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of orbital parameters. The probability is higher for planets that are closer to their stars because their orbital plane is more likely to be aligned with our line of sight. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The orbital distance affects the RV method (higher mass signal for closer-in planets), but for transit probability, it's about the inclination.

Wait, maybe the key is the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the star's radius. Because the transit depends on the alignment. The more edge-on the orbit is, the higher the probability. But since both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods and different host stars, we need to compute their semi-major axes.

Wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass and the period. The RV method doesn't give the inclination, but gives the mass based on the velocity semi-amplitude. But in this question, we're only concerned with the transit probability, which depends on the inclination.

Wait, but for transit probability, it's the probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits. The probability of a random inclination causing a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_p/a)^2))^(1/2) ). Wait, not sure.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × [ (a / sqrt(a² - R_s²)) ) ]^{-1} ), but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, I recall that the geometric probability (the chance that the planet transits) is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2))^(1/2)

Wait, I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (a sin i)) ), but this is getting me stuck.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about Kepler's third law. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P and the mass of the star (M_s). The formula is:

P² = (4 π² / G(M_s + M_p)) ) a³

But since M_p << M_s, we can approximate it as P² ≈ (4 π² / (G M_s)) a³

So, a³ = (G M_s P²) / (4 π²)

Therefore, a is proportional to (M_s P²)^(1/3)

So, for Planet_1, P1 = P2 / 3. M_s1 = 2 M_s2.

So, a1^3 = (G * 2 M_s2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

Similarly, a2^3 = (G M_s2 * P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

Dividing a1³ by a2³: (2 * (P2²/9)) ) / (M_s2 P2²) ) = (2/9) ) / 1 = 2/9.

Wait no, wait:

a1³ = (2 M_s2) * (P2/3)^2 * G / (4 π² )

a2³ = (M_s2) * P2^2 * G / (4 π² )

So a1³ / a2³ = [2 * (P2/3)^2 ] / [ M_s2 P2^2 ] * [ same denominator ]

Wait, actually, looking at the ratio:

a1³ / a2³ = [ (2 M_s2) * (P2/3)^2 ] / [ M_s2 * P2^2 ] ) = [ 2 * (P2²/9) ) ] / P2² = (2/9).

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) → (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = (2^(1/3)) / (3^(2/3)) )

But 9^(1/3) is 3^(2/3), right.

So a1 = a2 * (2^(1/3)) / (3^(2/3)) )

Wait, let me compute the numerical value:

(2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) ) ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605. So a1 is about 0.605 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Because the transit probability depends more on the planet's size relative to the star and how edge-on the orbit is, which depends on a and the star's radius.

Wait, but for the transit probability, I think the formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (a sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2)) )) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the transit occurrence probability: it's the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on enough for the transit. The formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / a) × ... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I think the key factors are:

- The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, because a larger planet or smaller star increases the chance of a transit.

- The probability is also inversely proportional to the orbital distance a. Because planets orbiting closer have a higher chance of transiting, perhaps? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no. The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit. The more distant the planet, the less likely the alignment. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, no, the transit probability is independent of a. Because it's about the alignment. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of an example. Suppose a planet is very close to the star—say, a is small. Then, the planet's orbit is a circle with a small radius. The chance that our line of sight intersects that circle is higher because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on when the planet is closer. No, wait, not necessarily. The probability is more about the angle between our line of sight and the orbital plane. 

Oh wait, the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle of our line of sight. The formula for the probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (a sin i)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the basic transit probability formula. From what I remember, the transit probability (the chance that the planet transits) is given by:

P = (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2) )

But wait, that can't be right because the units don't match. Let me think again.

Ah, here's the correct formula: The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the region where the planet can transit (a circle with radius R_p + R_s) to the area of the star's disk (π R_s²). So the probability is ( (R_p + R_s)^2 ) / ( (a)^2 ) ), but I'm not sure because the units don't make sense. Alternatively, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a sin i)), but I can't remember.

Wait, no. Another approach: The probability that a planet transits is the probability that the inclination is such that the planet passes in front of the star. The probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2)) )^(1/2).

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2))^(1/2) )

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of a simpler approach. Both planets have the same mass, but they orbit different stars. Let's denote:

For Planet_1:

- Star mass M1 = 2 M2

- Star radius R1 = R2 (same as Planet_2's host)

- Orbital period P1 = P2 / 3

We need to find the transit probability for each.

Transit probability depends on:

1. How often the planet is in front of the star. So it's a function of the planet's size relative to the star and how edge-on the orbit is.

But wait, in reality, the transit probability is a geometric probability. It is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. The formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2))^(1/2)

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. Alternatively, I think it's (R_p / R_s)^2 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2) )^(1/2).

Wait, according to the transit probability formula, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)) × (something else). Wait, maybe I can find an alternative approach.

Another way: the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough. The formula is:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a 

But that doesn't make sense because units don't match. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)² / (1 - (R_p / a)^2) )^(1/2).

I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - e^2)) )^(1/2) × (1 / (a sin i) )

But since e=0, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (a sin i) )

But sin i varies between 0 and 1, so the probability depends on whether i is 90 degrees (edge-on) or not. But for a random distribution of inclinations, the average sin i is 1/2, so the probability would be (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1/(a)) × 2.

Wait, perhaps. Because the average value of sin i for a random distribution of inclinations is 1/2. So when you average over all possible i, the probability would be (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1/(a)) × (1/ (1/2) ) ) → (R_p / R_s)^2 × 2/(a) )

But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, maybe it's best to compare the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2 based on their semi-major axes and other parameters.

Given that:

The mass of Planet_1's star is 2 M2 (M1 = 2 M2)

The orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = P2 / 3

So using Kepler's third law:

P² ∝ a³ / M_s

So for Planet_1:

a1³ = (G (M1) P1² ) / (4 π² )

= (G (2 M2) (P2^2 / 9) ) / (4 π² )

= (2/9) * (G M2 P2^2) / (4 π² )

Which is (2/9) a2³, because a2³ = (G M2 P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * (0.605)

So a1 is about 0.605 a2.

So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is.

Now, transit probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2 and the alignment. But since both planets have the same mass, but the question doesn't specify their radii. Oh wait, but the question doesn't give any information about the planet radii, so perhaps we can assume they're the same? Or perhaps it's irrelevant because the question is about the transit probability based on their host stars and orbital periods.

Wait, the question states that both planets have the same mass. But for the transit probability, we need the planet's radius. Since it's not given, maybe they're assuming that the planet's radius is the same. Alternatively, since the transit probability depends on R_p, and if R_p is same for both, then we can proceed.

So, assuming R_p1 = R_p2 = R_p.

The transit probability for each planet would be:

P1 = (R_p / R_s1)^2 * (function of a1 and R_s1)

P2 = (R_p / R_s2)^2 * (function of a2 and R_s2)

But since R_s1 = R_s2 (given), (R_p / R_s) is the same for both.

So, the transit probability would depend on the function involving a.

But what is that function? Let's think again.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is higher for planets that are closer to their stars because the orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on. Alternatively, it's the other way around. Hmm.

Wait, no. The probability is the same regardless of the distance if the stars are the same size. Because it's a geometric probability based on the alignment. But in reality, it's more complicated because the actual path of the planet's orbit depends on a.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the formula for the transit probability as a function of the semi-major axis.

The transit probability P is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2))^(1/2) )

But since both planets have the same R_p and R_s (since R_s1 = R_s2), this part is the same for both.

Thus, the only variable is (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2))^(1/2).

But since a is smaller for Planet_1 (a1 ≈ 0.605 a2), R_p / a1 is larger than R_p / a2. So (1 - (R_p/a)^2) would be smaller for Planet_1, so (1/(1 - (R_p/a)^2))^(1/2) would be larger.

Wait, let's compute this factor for both planets.

Let me define x = R_p / a.

For Planet_1, x1 = R_p / a1.

For Planet_2, x2 = R_p / a2.

Since a1 < a2, x1 > x2.

So the factor for Planet_1 is (1/(1 - x1²))^(1/2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - x1²)

Similarly for Planet_2: 1 / sqrt(1 - x2²)

But since x1 > x2, sqrt(1 - x1²) < sqrt(1 - x2²), so 1/sqrt(...) is larger for Planet_1.

Wait, but that would suggest that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but if a is smaller, then R_p/a is larger, so (R_p/a)^2 is larger, so 1 - (R_p/a)^2 is smaller, so 1/sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 is larger. So yes, P is higher for Planet_1.

But wait, if a is smaller, R_p/a is larger. So (R_p/a)^2 is larger. So if (R_p/a)^2 approaches 1, the denominator (1 - x²) approaches zero, making the entire factor blow up. But that can't be right because if a is too small, the planet would be inside the star.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in this approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the term (1 - (R_p/a)^2)^(1/2) in the denominator. If a is smaller, this term becomes smaller, making the entire factor larger.

So for Planet_1, because a1 is smaller, (R_p/a1) is larger, so (1 - (R_p/a1)^2) is smaller, so the factor is larger, leading to higher P.

So, the transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

Wait, but I thought transit probability was higher when the planet is farther out. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to recall the actual formula.

The transit probability for a circular orbit is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_s / a)^2))^(1/2) )

Wait, that's different. So here, R_s is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis.

So, in that case, the factor is (1/(1 - (R_s/a)^2))^(1/2).

Since R_s is the same for both stars, and a for Planet_1 is smaller, R_s / a1 is larger than R_s / a2.

So (1 - (R_s/a1)^2) is smaller than (1 - (R_s/a2)^2), so 1/sqrt(1 - (R_s/a)^2) is larger for Planet_1.

Therefore, the transit probability is higher for Planet_1.

But wait, if a is smaller, (R_s/a) is larger. So 1 - (R_s/a)^2 could be negative if R_s > a, but that's impossible because a is the semi-major axis, which must be larger than R_s for the planet to orbit. So, R_s < a, so (R_s/a)^2 < 1. So 1 - ... is positive.

So, for Planet_1:

Factor = 1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a1)^2 )

Similarly for Planet_2.

So, since a1 = a2 * 0.605, R_s/a1 = R_s/(0.605 a2) ≈ (R_s/a2) / 0.605 ≈ (R_s/a2) * 1.653.

So, (R_s/a1)^2 = (R_s/a2)^2 * (1.653)^2 ≈ (R_s/a2)^2 * 2.73.

So the factor for Planet_1 is 1 / sqrt(1 - 2.73*(R_s/a2)^2 )

And for Planet_2, it's 1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s/a2)^2 )

Let me denote (R_s/a2)^2 as x. So x = (R_s/a2)^2.

Then, for Planet_2:

Factor = 1/sqrt(1 - x )

For Planet_1:

Factor = 1/sqrt(1 - 2.73 x )

Now, the transit probability for each is:

P1 = (R_p/R_s)^2 * [ 1 / sqrt(1 - 2.73 x) ]

P2 = (R_p/R_s)^2 * [ 1 / sqrt(1 - x) ]

So the ratio P1/P2 = [1/sqrt(1 -2.73 x)] / [1/sqrt(1 - x) ] = sqrt( (1 - x) / (1 - 2.73 x) )

But this depends on x, which is (R_s/a2)^2. Do we know anything about x?

Wait, the star's radius is given, but we don't have the actual value. However, perhaps we can assume that for both planets, the semi-major axis is much larger than the star's radius, so x is small. So, we can approximate using a Taylor expansion.

Assume x is small. Then, 1 - x ≈ 1, and 1 - 2.73 x ≈ 1.

But then, the ratio becomes sqrt(1/1) = 1. That would imply that P1 and P2 have the same probability, which can't be right.

Wait, but without knowing x, how can I proceed? Maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, in reality, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the star and the planet's orbit. Let's think about the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis.

If a is much larger than R_s, then (R_s/a) is small, and the factor becomes approximately 1, making the transit probability roughly (R_p/R_s)^2, which is the same for both planets if R_p is the same.

But if a is not much larger than R_s, then the factor becomes significant.

But in this question, we don't have the actual values of a and R_s. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the RV method gives us the minimum mass, which is m sin i. But we don't have the inclination i, which complicates things. But the question is about transit probability, which depends on the actual inclination. But since the inclinations are random, we can model the average.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the same as the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on, which is (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (1 - (R_p / a)^2 ))^(1/2) )

But again, without knowing a or R_p, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the question's given options. The options are comparing the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2.

The options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So, the question is, which one has a higher probability.

From earlier, I thought that the transit probability might be higher for Planet_1 because a1 is smaller, making (R_s/a1) larger, which would increase the factor, leading to higher P.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the RV method. The RV method's sensitivity depends on the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. But that's not directly relevant to the transit probability.

Wait, another angle: the probability that a planet transits is higher when the star is smaller because it's easier for the planet to pass in front. But in this case, the stars have the same radius.

So, (R_p/R_s) is the same for both.

The other factor is a, the semi-major axis. How does a affect the transit probability?

Wait, for the same star radius, a planet that is closer (smaller a) would have a higher chance of transiting because the orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on.

Wait, no. The transit probability is a geometric probability and is independent of a. Because it's about the planet's path relative to our line of sight. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × (1 / (a sin i)) ), but again, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is the same regardless of a, as it's a matter of alignment. But that doesn't make sense because if a is larger, the planet's orbit is a bigger circle, making the chance of alignment lower.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the ratio of their probabilities.

Let me denote the transit probability as P ∝ (R_p/R_s)^2 × (1 / (a)) )

Wait, if that's the case, then:

P1/P2 ∝ ( (R_p1/R_s1)^2 / a1 ) / ( (R_p2/R_s2)^2 / a2 )

But R_p1 = R_p2, R_s1 = R_s2.

So, P1/P2 ∝ (1/a1) / (1/a2 ) = a2/a1

Since a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.605 a2.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.605 ≈ 1.653.

Thus, P1/P2 ≈ 1.653.

So, Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability than Planet_2.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, according to this, the ratio is approximately 1.65, so option C.

But wait, my assumption was that P ∝ 1/a, which I'm not sure is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_p/R_s)^2 × (1/(a)).

In that case, the ratio would be (a2 / a1) = 1/0.605 ≈ 1.65.

So, the probability is higher for Planet_1, and it is 1.65 times higher.

So, the correct answer would be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters and their implications for transit probability. Transit probability depends on the geometric alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight and the relative sizes of the planet and the star. The formula for transit probability is approximately:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \times \frac{1}{a}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets have the same mass and the stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), the comparison hinges on the semi-major axis \(a\).

### Step 1: Calculate the semi-major axes
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the star's mass \(M_s\):

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_s}
\]

For Planet_1:
- Orbital period \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\)
- Star mass \(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\)

For Planet_2:
- Orbital period \(P_2\)
- Star mass \(M_{s2}\)

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{s1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

This means \(a_1 \approx 0.605a_2\), or equivalently, \(a_2 \approx 1.65a_1\).

### Step 2: Compare transit probabilities
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\(P \propto 1/a\)). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1.65a_1}{a_1} = 1.65
\]

This indicates that Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability difference is not 2.25 times.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability difference is not 1.5 times.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and its transit probability is approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The probability difference is not 2.7 times.

### Final Answer:
Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting.
