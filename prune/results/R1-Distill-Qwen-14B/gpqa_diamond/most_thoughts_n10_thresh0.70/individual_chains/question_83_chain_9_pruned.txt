Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

First, the problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, okay, so the initial solution is diluted. Let me compute the concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we add water, it will dilute, so the concentration will decrease. 

The initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). 

Using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2. So, C2 = (C1 * V1) / V2. 

C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. V2 is 0.04 L.

So C2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.05 * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Then, divided by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, during titration with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the equivalence point calculation.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially. 

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles = Molarity * Volume. So, volume V = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So, equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but for the 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's tackle each part.

First, the pH at 25% titration. At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let's compute the moles.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.
