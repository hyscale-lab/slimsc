Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should produce the acetate ion.

The problem says we start by diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh, and the Ka is given as 1.85x10^-5.

First, I think I need to find the initial concentration after dilution. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be halved. Let me calculate that. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Got it, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So every mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. 

At 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? Well, the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence can be calculated. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.025 M * 0.04 L (40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles. So the equivalence point requires 0.001 moles of NaOH. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is (0.001 mol) / 0.1 M = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Oh, right, because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So when diluted to 40 cm³, as I said, it's 0.025 M. But moles are same, 0.001.

So the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So 25% titration is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

Now, for the pH at 25% titration. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles reacted = 0.001 * 0.25 = 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the solution is now a buffer solution because we have both the weak acid and its conjugate base. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

What's pKa? Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = approximately 4.74 (since log(1.85e-5)= -4.736, so pKa is 4.74 would be correct).

So the concentrations of A^- and HA in the solution. Let me think about the total volume at this point. Original solution was 40 cm³. Added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). So the concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L, and the concentration of acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the ratio [A^-]/[HA] instead. Because when I take the ratio, the volumes will cancel out. So the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is negative, since 1/3 is less than 1. Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263. So approximately 4.26. 

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D is 4.57; that's higher, so maybe I made a mistake?

Wait, wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation uses the ratio of concentrations, not moles. But because the same volume is present for both (since they're in the same solution), the ratio of moles is the same as the ratio of concentrations. So my approach was correct.

So 1/3 ratio gives pH of about 4.26. So that's the first part.

Now, the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the hydrolysis of acetate. The concentration of acetate at equivalence point can be calculated. 

First, the moles of acetate at equivalence point are 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ (25% is 2.5 cm³, but equivalency is 10 cm³) of NaOH added. So 50 cm³ total, 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait no. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb is 1e-14 /
