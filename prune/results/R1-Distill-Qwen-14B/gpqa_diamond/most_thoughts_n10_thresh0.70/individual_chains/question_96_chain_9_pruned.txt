Okay, so I have this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, which is related to their area. Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. The formula is S = (A * k * c^3) / (4 * ħ * G), where A is the area of the event horizon, k is Boltzmann's constant, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant.

Wait, the question gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, R, right? Because the area A is 4πR².

The angular size θ is very small—10^-17 degrees. I think I should convert that to radians because the formula for angular size uses radians. To convert degrees to radians, I multiply by π/180. So θ in radians would be approximately (10^-17 degrees) * (π/180) ≈ (10^-17) * (3.1416/180) radians. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 3.1416/180 is roughly 0.01745. So 10^-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Is that right? That seems correct.

The formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d, assuming that R is much smaller than d (which it is, since d is 1e10 parsecs). So R ≈ θ * d. But wait, I need to make sure about the units. D is given in parsecs, so I should convert that to meters, since all other constants in the formula are in SI units.

1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = θ * d = (1.745e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) ≈ let's calculate that.

Multiplying 1.745e-19 by 3.086e26. Let's see: 1.745 * 3.086 is approx 5.38, and the exponents are 1e7 (since 10^-19 * 10^26 = 10^7). So R ≈ 5.38e7 meters. Wait, 5.38e7 meters is 5.38e4 kilometers, right? That's about 53,800 km. Wait, but wait, supermassive black holes can have much larger event horizons. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1e10 parsecs is 10^10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m. Correct. θ is 1e-17 degrees, which is θ ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So R=θ*d = 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 *3.086) * 1e( -19 +26) ) = 5.38 * 1e7 = 5.38e7 meters. Yes, that's 5.38e7 m, which is 5.38e4 km. Hmm, but supermassive black holes have event horizons much larger than that. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents? Let me recheck.

Wait, 3.086e26 m is correct for 1e10 parsecs. 1e-17 degrees is a very tiny angle, so R is about 5e7 meters. Wait, but that's about 5e4 km. Hmm, our Sun's Schwarzschild radius is about 3 km, so a supermassive black hole would have a much larger radius. Oh wait, but wait—the calculation is correct, perhaps. Let me think. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2GM/c². For a supermassive black hole, like say 1e8 solar masses. The Sun's mass is ~2e30 kg. So 1e8 solar masses is 2e38 kg. Then R_s = 2 * G * M / c².

G is 6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²), c is 3e8 m
