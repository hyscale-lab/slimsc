Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think. Oh right, Stephen Hawking and all that—so the entropy formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, but I need to find the entropy, so I probably need to calculate the area first. The question gives me the angular size θ and the distance d, so maybe I can find the diameter of the event horizon using those. Oh right, θ is in radians when I use the small angle approximation. But wait, the given θ is in degrees. Oh, right, I should convert that to radians first.

So, the formula for the angular size is θ (in radians) ≈ diameter / distance. Or wait, more accurately, the formula is θ = (diameter) / (distance). But wait, diameter would be 2r, so θ = (2r)/(d). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (linear size) / (distance), but only when the angle is small, which it is here since θ is 1e-17 degrees, which is super tiny. So, yeah, θ ≈ s / d, where s is the linear size. So s ≈ θ * d.

But wait, I need to calculate the radius of the event horizon, which is
