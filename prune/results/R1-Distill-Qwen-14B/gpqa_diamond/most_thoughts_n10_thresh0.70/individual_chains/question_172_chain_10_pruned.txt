Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and the photospheres are in LTE, so that must mean Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. 

Right, LTE implies that the distribution of particles in energy states follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The excitation here depends on temperature. So for each energy level, the occupation number is given by the Boltzmann factor. 

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like n_i = n_0 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. 

Wait, but the question says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of their populations. Let me think. 

Let me denote the ratio as n1/n2 = 2. So n1 is twice n2. So according to the Boltzmann equation, for each star, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). But wait, in this case, star_1 has higher excitation, so I think the energy difference is positive for higher energy. 

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say the upper level has energy E, and the lower level is E - ΔE. So the ratio n_upper / n_lower would be proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). 

But in our case, the question says the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So for each star, the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) compared to the ground state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. 

So for star_1: n1 = n0_1 * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2: n2 = n0_2 * exp( -Δ
