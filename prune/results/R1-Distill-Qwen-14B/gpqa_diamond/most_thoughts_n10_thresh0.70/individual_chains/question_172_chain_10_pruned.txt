Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so star_1 has higher excitation? But wait, it's the energy difference between the levels that's given: 1.38e-23 J. 

So, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), right? Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor is for the probability of a particle being in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. 

So if level E2 is higher than E1 by ΔE, the ratio N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). But wait, in this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. So for star 1, N1 is twice N2 for that energy level. Wait no, wait. The question says "twice as excited" in a specific energy level. So I think that refers to the number of atoms in that higher energy level. So let's say the ground state is E1 and the excited state is E2, which is higher. 

So for star 1, N2_1 is twice N2_2 (N2_2 being the number in star 2). So N2_1 / N2_2 = 2. 

Using Boltzmann, N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for each star, we can write N2/(N1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). 

Wait, but wait, the ratio N2/N1 for each star would be exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So let's denote for star_1, (N2_1)/(N1_1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, (N2_2)/(N1_2) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But wait, the question says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice those in star_2. So N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. But wait, I'm not sure if that's
