Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying a final product after a series of reactions based on NMR data. Alright, let me break this down.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. That doesn't immediately ring a bell, but I'll think about it. The NMR data is given, so that should help determine the structure.

Looking at the NMR:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm, probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes usually are around 9-10. But wait, sometimes other deshielded protons like amines or something else could be high. Hmm, but more likely an aldehyde.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those are doublets each integrating for 2H. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling between them suggests they're adjacent on the ring. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, the coupling would be between protons on adjacent carbons, but wait, maybe it's a meta coupling? No, wait, the splitting for aromatic protons depends on the substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet. 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like OH protons. But wait, it's a singlet, so maybe it's two protons that are not split by neighboring Hs. Could it be a vinyl proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that deshield it, but I'm not sure.

3.66 (d, 2H) – doublet, integrating for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something, like an oxygen. Maybe OCH2, or maybe part of an amide or ester. Alternatively, if it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl, that could be possible.

Wait, putting this together. Let me think about the possible structures. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8
