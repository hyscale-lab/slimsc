Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, probably it's assumed to be normalized. Or maybe I need to normalize it first. Hmm, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must have a norm of 1. So let me check that.

The state vector is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Oh right, because when you compute the inner product, you need the vector to be normalized.

So the actual state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, we have the operators P and Q. The matrix for P is given. Let me write that out.

P matrix:
First row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

And Q matrix is diagonal:
First row: [1, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -1]

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. So measuring Q can give 1, 0, or -1, with probabilities depending on the state.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. But wait, no, the measurements are in sequence: first P, then Q. Wait no, the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Wait the wording is a bit confusing. Oh no, no: the question says if someone measures Q just after measuring P. Wait, no, the question says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Wait, no: the question says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." Wait, no, the question is, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?"

Wait no, no, the measurements are in the order P first and then Q. Because the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the process is: measure P, then measure Q.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the question is about measuring P first, and then measuring Q. So the measurement of P affects the state, which then is measured for Q. So the state after the first measurement (P) is a state that is an eigenstate of P, and then Q is measured on that state.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P, the state becomes one of
