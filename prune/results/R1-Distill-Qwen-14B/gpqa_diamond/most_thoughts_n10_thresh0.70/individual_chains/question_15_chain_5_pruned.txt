Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the sizes of the star and planet, and the planet's orbital distance.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter periodâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since the orbital period relates to the distance through Kepler's laws. 

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but for transit probability, I think the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance are key. Oh, right, the probability that a planet transits is roughly proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the orbital separation. Because a planet must be near the line of sight, so a smaller a (closer orbit) increases the chance.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii are similar, so maybe R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the probability is roughly R_star / a. But wait, a is in astronomical units? No, wait, the actual formula I think is R_star divided by (a), multiplied by something else. Or wait, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (something else?)) Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me recall. The probability for a planet to transit is given by (R*)/(a (1 - e^2)^0.5), but assuming circular orbits (e=0), so it's just R*/a. But wait, that's not the whole story. Because the planet's orbital plane must be aligned with our line of sight. The actual probability depends on the geometry, and the formula is (R_*)/(a) multiplied by (1) divided by (something else?).

Wait, no, I think the correct approximate formula is (R_*) / a multiplied by (1 / sin i), but since i is the inclination, which is 90 degrees (edge-on) for a transit, that term is 1. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_star
