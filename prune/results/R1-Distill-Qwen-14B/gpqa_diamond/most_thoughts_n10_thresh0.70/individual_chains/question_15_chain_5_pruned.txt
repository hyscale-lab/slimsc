Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of detecting a transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But for transiting, other factors come into play. Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, that means Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter period implies a smaller orbit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. If two stars have the same radius but different masses, the more massive star must be hotter or perhaps in a different evolutionary stage. But here, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which might mean it's a subgiant or something, but same radius as Planet_1's star.

I think the probability of transit is calculated as the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit. Or wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_s / a), where R_s is the star's radius and a is the orbital semi-major axis. Because the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the inclination. 

The formula for transit probability is R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the orbital separation. So if a planet is closer (smaller a), the probability increases because a is in the denominator.

Wait, let me get this right. The probability P is approximately (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both have circular orbits, e=0, so it's (R_*/a). So P is proportional to (R*/a).

But wait, a is the semi-major axis. For planets with the same period, a would be determined by Kepler's third law. But in this case, the periods are different. Let's see: the period P is related to a via P² = (4π²/G(M+M*)) a³. But since M* is the mass of the star, and the planets' masses are much smaller, M+M* ≈ M*. So a³ is proportional to P² * (M*)/(4π² G), but wait, G and the constants can be ignored. So a³ = (G M* P²)/(4 π²). But for Kepler's law, a³ is proportional to (P² * M*). So a = [ (G M* P²/(4π²) ) ]^(1/3). 

Wait, but I'm trying to find a in terms of P and M*. Alternatively, for a given star mass, a is proportional to (P)^(2/3). Because a^3 ∝ P² * M* → a ∝ P^(2/3) * M*^(1/3). Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the formula a = [ (G M* P² )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3). 

So for Planet_1, P1 = P, Planet_2 has P2 = 3P. So a1 is [ (G M1 (P)^2 )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3). For Planet_2, a2 is [ (G M2 (3P)^2 )/(4 π²) ]^(1/3).

Given that M1 = 2 M2, since Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's.

So let me compute a1 and a2.

a1 ∝ (M1 * P1^2 )^(1/3) → (2 M2 * P² )^(1/3) → (2)^(1/3) * (M2)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

a2 ∝ (M2 * (3P)^2 )^(1/3) → (M2 *9 P² )^(1/3) → (9)^(1/3) * (M2)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

So the ratio a1/a2 is [2^(1/3) / 9^(1/3)] → (2/9)^(1/3). Let's compute that. 2 is 2, 9 is 3². So (2/9)^(1/3) is (2)^(1/3) / (3^(2/3)). Alternatively, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 3^(2/3) is about 2.08. So ratio a1/a2 is approx 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So a2 is larger than a1.

But the transit probability is (R*/a). Both stars have same R*, so P1 = (R*/a1), P2 = (R*/a2). So the ratio P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

From earlier, a2 is about 1/0.606 times a1. So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So P1/P2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

Wait, wait. Because a1 is smaller than a2, R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So which planet has a higher probability? Planet_1, because a1 is smaller. So since R* is same, R*/a is higher when a is smaller.

Wait, but the question says both have same R*. So:

P1 = R*/a1

P2 = R*/a2

Since a1 < a2, then P1 > P2.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

But let me think about the options. The options are about which is preferred and by how much.

The options are:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred
