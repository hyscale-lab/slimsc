Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 8, H is9, N is1, O is1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees. That could mean a benzene ring (3 double bonds, so 3 degrees) plus a double bond or a ring and a triple bond or something else. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (which is another double bond). 

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and are split into triplets if adjacent to another CH2 group. Hmm.

Another peak at 6.98 ppm, a doublet (d) with 2H. Then 6.51 ppm, another doublet with 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest two separate pairs, which could be two substituents on the benzene, perhaps. 

Then 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet with 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group nearby, but 2H in a singlet. Wait, but aromatic protons are usually around 6.5-8.5. So perhaps this is a conjugated diene? Or maybe it's an enol or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2- group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a hemiacetal or something, but that seems less likely.

The peak at 3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H. This seems like maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative atom like oxygen.

Putting this together: Maybe the structure has
