Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what each spectrograph can observe.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—brighter means lower magnitudes. So a star with V mag less than 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. And HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag less than 16. So any star that is brighter than V=16 can be seen by both? Or wait, no—if a star is brighter than V=17 for ESPRESSO, and brighter than V=16 for HIRES, then a star that is brighter than 16 can be seen by both. Because 16 is brighter than 17.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, wait. Because apparent magnitude scales are inverted. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a star with an apparent V magnitude of 17 is dimmer than one with 16. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, which would be up to 17 mag. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, which would be up to 16 mag. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be seen by both. Because if a star is 15, it's brighter than 16 and 17, so both can see it. If a star is between 16 and 17, like 16.5, then only ESPRESSO can see it, because HIRES requires brighter than 16 (so up to 16 mag? Or wait, the question says "brighter than 16 V mag can be observed" with HIRES. So stars with V mag less than 16 can be observed. So any star with V mag ≤16 is observable by HIRES, and any with V mag ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO.

So the stars that can be observed by both must have V mag ≤16.

Now, let's look at each star and calculate their apparent V magnitudes.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5. Distance is 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M +5 +5 log10(d) where d is in parsecs. So m = 15.5 +5 +5*log(10). Wait, log(10) is 1, so 5*1 =5. So 15.5 +5 +5 =25.5? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is m - M =5 log10(d) -5. So m = M + 5 log10(d) -5 +5? No, wait, let's get the formula right. The distance modulus is m - M =5 log1
