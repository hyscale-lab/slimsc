Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, waitâ€”I think it's brighter than 17, so apparent V magnitude less than 17. Because higher magnitudes are dimmer, right? So stars with V mag <= 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V mag <=16 for HIRES.

So the star needs to be bright enough (apparent V mag <=16) to be seen by HIRES and also bright enough (<=17) to be seen by ESPRESSO. Wait, but since HIRES requires brighter (lower mag) stars, the limiting factor is HIRES. So any star that is visible by HIRES will automatically be visible by ESPRESSO, because ESPRESSO goes up to 17. Wait no, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. If a star is brighter than 16 mag in V, then it's observed by HIRES, and because 16 is less than 17, it's also observed by ESPRESSO. So any star with V mag <=16 can be observed by both. But wait, the question is asking which stars can
