Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that both these spectrographs are used for high-resolution spectroscopy, often for exoplanet research and measuring stellar velocities. The key here is that each has different magnitude limits. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, and HIRES can observe up to 16. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait: generally, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because, like, a magnitude of 6 is brighter than 7. So if a star's V magnitude is brighter than 17, that would be V <17.

Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V magnitude <16.

So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 (because HIRES can't go beyond 16) and ≤17 (ESPRESSO can go up to 17). Wait no, no. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", which would be V < 17. Similarly, with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed (V <16). So the star must be brighter than both 17 and 16? No, wait, that can't be right. Because a star can be brighter than 17 (i.e., V <17), which is less restrictive than being brighter than 16 (V<16). Wait, no: if a star has V=15, it's brighter than both. If a star has V=17, then it's not observable by HIRES, because HIRES only goes up to V=16. So to be observable by both, the star's V must be ≤16, because HIRES can only go up to 16. So the apparent magnitude has to be less than 16.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So brighter than 17 mag means V < 17. Similarly, with HIRES, brighter than 16, so V <16. So the star must be V <17 for ESPRESSO and V <16 for HIRES. So the star must satisfy both, so V <16. Because if it's V=16.5, it can't be observed by HIRES, but ESPRESSO can. So to be observed by both, the apparent V must be ≤16.

So now, for each star, I need to compute their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (dust reddening), and then check if it's ≤16. Because only then both telescopes can see it.

Wait, but wait: some of the stars have absolute magnitudes, and some have apparent. So I need to calculate apparent magnitude for those that only have absolute.

Wait, let's go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude of 15.5, distance 10 pc. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10, so log(10/10)=0. So m =15.5 + 0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5,
