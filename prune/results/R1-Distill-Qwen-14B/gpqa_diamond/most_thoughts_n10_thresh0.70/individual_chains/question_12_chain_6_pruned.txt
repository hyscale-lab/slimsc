Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. Pi(+) is at rest, right?

So, the rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the mu(+) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos have very little mass, so I guess I can treat their mass as negligible. Or maybe for this problem, they just ignore it? Because in particle physics, neutrinos are considered massless sometimes, especially in problems like this.

Wait, but in reality, neutrinos do have mass. Oh, but the problem doesn't give any mass for the neutrino, so I think I should proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's mass is zero. So, m_nu = 0.

The goal is to find the kinetic energies of the mu(+) and the neutrino. Since Pi(+) is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|, and their directions are opposite. So, p_nu = -p_mu.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinetic energies, right? So, I think
