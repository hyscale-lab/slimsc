Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance and their periods are in a ratio. So I need to find the ratio of their temperatures, specifically Planet_4 to Planet_2.

The periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the five planets. So Planet_2 has a period twice that of Planet_1. Planet_4 has a period 3.5 times Planet_1. But wait, I think the equilibrium temperature formula is based on the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), but wait, no, I think it's more like T = T_eff * (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4). Or maybe another approach. Oh, right! The equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/4) * (1/(sqrt(a)) ). But since the question says all planets have the same albedo and presumably negligible eccentricity (because the orbits are circular), the albedo and e terms are the same for all. So the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes, a.

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right. Equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_eff * ( (1 - A)
