Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember the RV method involves looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a Neptune-mass planet. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these, and the shifts in their spectral lines are given: planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I got that backwards. Oh, no, the question says Planet #1 has a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 has a 7. So which one is moving more? But I'm not sure yet.

The question is asking about the ratio of their orbital periods. So, how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star's wobble. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (P * (2Ï€))^(1/3) * sqrt(a) )) )

Wait, that might be more complicated than I need. I think for circular orbits (e=0), and when the planet mass is much smaller than the star (which is the case here, Neptune is way less than Sun), the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*)^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) * (1/(1 - e^2))^something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) which is the velocity
