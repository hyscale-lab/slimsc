Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene, which has a structure similar to pinene but with a different arrangement. (R)-Limonene is a chiral molecule, right? So its structure is a bicyclic monoterpene, maybe something like a cyclohexene ring with substituents.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. I think this is a hydrogenation reaction. Hydrogenation of alkenes usually adds hydrogen across the double bond. So limonene, which has double bonds, would undergo hydrogenation. But wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, like a bicyclic structure. So if we hydrogenate it, the double bonds would become single bonds. Let me think about the structure of limonene. Limonene has a structure with two rings, maybe a cyclohexene ring fused with another ring. So when hydrogenated, the double bond would saturate. So for example, if limonene is something like 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene, hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, making it a cyclohexane with substituents.

But wait, actually, the structure of limonene is more like a bicyclic structure, maybe a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something similar? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recall: limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, and it's actually a bicyclic molecule with a structure that includes a cyclohexene ring. So upon hydrogenation, the double bond in the ring would be saturated. 

Wait, the problem says that after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as the major product. So maybe it's a partial hydrogenation? Or perhaps it's a hydrogenation of a specific double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the limonene has another double bond besides the ring one. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the structure of limonene, so maybe I should look that up mentally. 

Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene
