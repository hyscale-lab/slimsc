Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the Sun's neutrino production and what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton (pp) chains.

Wait, the pp-III branch... I think the pp chain has different branches. The main pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing helium-4. Then there's the pp-II branch, which I think leads to boron and contributes to the neutrino emission. The pp-III branch might be a minor part of the process, maybe involving higher energy reactions or different paths.

So, the question says the pp-III branch stops about 8.5 minutes ago. That's the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, stopping the pp-III branch would mean that the neutrinos from that process won't reach us anymore. But what's the effect on the neutrino flux?

Neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges based on the reactions. The pp-I branch mainly produces low-energy neutrinos, while the pp-II and pp-III branches might produce higher-energy ones. Oh wait, but I'm a bit confused here. I think the dominant neutrino emission comes from the pp-I branch, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

Wait, the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, we need to compare the flux in these two bands after the pp-III branch stops.

If the pp-III branch produces a lot of neutrinos in a certain energy range, stopping it would reduce the flux in that range. Let's think about the energy distribution of neutrinos from the different branches.

I remember that the pp-I process produces neutrinos with energies up to about a few hundred keV. The higher branches, like pp-II and pp-III, might produce higher energy neutrinos. So, pp-III is probably responsible for some of the higher energy neutrinos.

So, if pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop. But how does that affect the specific bands given?

Suppose the pp-III neutrinos are mostly in the 800-900 keV range. Then, if that branch stops, the flux in band 2 would drop significantly. The flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) might be less affected because it's possibly dominated by another process, maybe the pp-II branch or pp-I.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy ranges. Let me try to recall or think through. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with energies up to about 200 keV or so. The pp-II branch produces higher energy neutrinos, maybe around 500-800 keV? And the pp-III would be even higher, like 800-900 keV or more?

Alternatively, maybe the main neutrino flux from the pp-I process has a certain peak. The pp-II and pp-III might contribute to the higher energy neutrinos.

In the solar neutrino spectrum, the majority of the neutrinos are from the pp-I process and are in lower energy ranges. The higher energy neutrinos are a smaller fraction.

So, if pp-III is stopped, the high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would decrease. But what's the original contribution of pp-III to band 1 and band 2?

If pp-III mainly contributes to band 2 (800-900), then before stopping, the flux in band 2 would have more contribution from pp-III. So, after stopping, the flux in band 2 would drop, but band 1 might not be as affected.

Assuming that the flux ratio is (Flux band1)/(Flux band2). Originally, let's say band 2 had a higher flux because of pp-III. After stopping, band2's flux drops, so the ratio would go up. Or wait, maybe the opposite.

Wait, let's think numerically. Let's say before stopping, the flux
