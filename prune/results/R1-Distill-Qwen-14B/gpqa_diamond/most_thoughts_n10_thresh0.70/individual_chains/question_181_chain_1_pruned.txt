Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me think this through.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy. The pp-III branch is probably one of the steps in that chain.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of these reactions. Oh right, the main neutrino types from the Sun are from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces electron neutrinos (Î½e) and some others, I think.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? The pp-III must be a specific part of the proton-proton cycle. Let me recall: the proton-proton chain has several branches. The main one, pp-I, leads to the production of deuterium. Then, sometimes it's said that there are other branches, like pp-II and pp-III, which maybe involve higher energy states or different intermediates.

Wait, the dominant neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp-I branch, specifically the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus decays into lithium-7 and emits a neutrino. But I'm not sure about the details of each branch's neutrino contribution.

If the pp-III branch stops, that means that whatever neutrinos were produced in that branch are no longer being made. But I'm trying to figure out how this affects the flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

I think the neutrino energies depend on the specific reactions. Each reaction in the chain emits a neutrino with a certain energy. For example, the main neutrino line from the Sun is around 1.4 MeV. But wait, that's from the boron-8 decay. So, if the pp-III branch is involved in producing neutrinos of a certain energy, stopping it would reduce their flux.

Wait, but neutrinos with lower energies than the main line might come from other reactions. Like maybe the pep branch emits lower energy neutrinos, such as around 1 MeV or less. But I'm not certain about the exact energies.

Alternatively, maybe the
