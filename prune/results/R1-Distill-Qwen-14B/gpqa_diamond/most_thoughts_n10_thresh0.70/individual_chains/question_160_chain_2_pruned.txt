Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Hmm, it's about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining on it, and I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Oh right, and when N is infinitely large. Also, I can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ. 

Wait, okay, so first I should probably recall what an apothem is. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So in this case, all apothems are length a. That probably means that each side is a certain distance from the center, but since it's a regular polygon, all sides are equal.

Wait, but when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So maybe this problem is about a circular aperture when N approaches infinity. But wait, no, because a circle's apothem would be the same as its radius. Wait, no, wait: for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem would be equal to the radius. So in that case, a is the radius of the circular aperture. 

Wait, but the problem says the apothems are of the same length a. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is a, and when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius a. So the setup is similar to a circular aperture, so the far field diffraction pattern would be the familiar single-slit diffraction pattern.

Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is different. But wait, the question is about an N-sided polygon with N approaching infinity, so the shape becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to a circular aperture's diffraction pattern. But wait, the options given don't look like the standard single slit results. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the far field diffraction pattern (Fraunhofer diffraction) has a central bright
