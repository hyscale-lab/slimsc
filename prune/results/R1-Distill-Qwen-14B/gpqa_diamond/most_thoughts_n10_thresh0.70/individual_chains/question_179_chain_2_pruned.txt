Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices are used to represent various things like states, operators, and so on. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, let's look at the matrices given:

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1 -i

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z is:
3   2i   5
-2i -2  -4i
5   4i   4

The question is about properties of these matrices and which statement is correct among the options A to D.

Option A says: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, e^X is the matrix exponential of X. If X is a Hermitian matrix, then e^X would be unitary because Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues, and the exponential of a Hermitian is unitary. But if X is not Hermitian, then e^X might not be unitary. The norm change would depend on whether e^X is unitary. Because for a unitary matrix U, ||Uv|| = ||v|| for any vector v. So if e^X is unitary, the norm doesn't change. If not, it does.

So I need to check if X is Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix equals its conjugate transpose. Let's compute X's conjugate transpose.

X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate transpose (X†) would have entries where each element is the complex conjugate of the transpose. Let's compute X†:

Original X:

a11 = i →† will be a11* = -i
a12 = -1 → a21 = -1
a13 = 2i → a31 = -2i
a21 = 1 → a12 = 1
a22 = 0 → a22 =0
a23 =1 → a32=1
a31 =2i → a13= -2i? Wait, no, I think I might have gotten confused here. Let's do this properly.

The conjugate transpose (X†) is computed by first transposing the matrix and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.

So X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Transposing X swaps rows and columns:

First row of X becomes first column of X†:
i, 1, 2i → column 1.

Second row → column 2:
-1, 0, -1 → column 2.

Wait, wait, let me write the transpose correctly.

Wait, matrix X is:

Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [2i, -1, -i]

The transpose, X^T, would be:

Column 1: i, 1, 2i → becomes row 1: [i, 1, 2i]
Column 2: -1, 0, -1 → row 2: [-1, 0, -1]
Column 3: 2i, 1, -i → row 3: [2i, 1, -i]

Then, the conjugate transpose X† is the complex conjugate of
