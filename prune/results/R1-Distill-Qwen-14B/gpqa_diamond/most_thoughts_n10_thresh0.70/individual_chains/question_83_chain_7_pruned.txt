Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. They start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then they dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, they titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking what the pH will be at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So first, I need to find out the new concentration after diluting the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and its dissociation is being affected by the dilution.

Wait, so the initial volume is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. When you add 20 mL of water, the volume becomes 40 mL. So the concentration will be halved because the volume doubles. Let me calculate that.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. But wait, volume in liters. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 40 mL (0.04 L), so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me think: the moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, the initial moles were 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001, and after dilution, that's still 0.001 moles. So when titrated, the NaOH will neutralize that.

To find the equivalence point volume, moles NaOH = moles acetic acid. So 0.001 moles = 0.1 M × V. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL. But wait, the initial solution was 40 mL, and adding 10 mL of NaOH would make the total volume 50 mL. But the question isn't asking for the equivalence point volume; it's asking about the pH at the equivalence point. 

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions (CH3COO^-). So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic. The pH can be calculated using the Kb of acetate.

Wait, how's that done? The Kb is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb would be 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point is the moles divided by the total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 moles (same as the original acetic acid). The total volume is 40 mL + 10 mL = 50 mL = 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So the acetate solution is 0.02 M. Using
