Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized and also the pH at the equivalence point.

First, I should probably start by figuring out the concentrations after dilution and then consider the titration process.

So, acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH, and NaOH is a strong base. The reaction between them should produce the acetate ion, CH3COO⁻, and water. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution.**
   The volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02000 L. Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so moles = M * V.
   So, moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

2. **Dilution with water.**
   We add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04000 L). The concentration after dilution will be moles / total volume.
   So, new concentration (C1) = 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait. Wait, wait. Because 0.02 L is 20 cm³, adding another 20 cm³ makes 40, so 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 is 0.025 M. Got it.

3. **Titrating with NaOH.**
   The NaOH is 0.1 M. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na+ + H2O.

   At 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, let's find out how much NaOH is added at this point.

   First, let's find the moles of acetic acid present. Initially, after dilution, there's 0.001 moles. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles have reacted.

   Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
   Moles of CH3COO⁻ formed: 0.00025 moles.

   But wait, when we add NaOH, it's a strong base, so it will also dilute the solution. Hmm, I think I need to find the new concentrations in the solution after adding the NaOH.

   Wait, but how much NaOH is added? Let me calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% titration.

   The moles of NaOH added is equal to the moles of CH3COOH neutralized, which is 0.00025 moles. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume (V) is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L → 2.5 mL.

   So, the total volume after adding NaOH is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.

   Now, the concentrations after this addition:

   [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.
   [CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

   But wait, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

   The equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).

   The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(
