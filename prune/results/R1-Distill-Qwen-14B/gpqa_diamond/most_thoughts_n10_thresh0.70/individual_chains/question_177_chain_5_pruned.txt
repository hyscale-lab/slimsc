Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same with the mass—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. Interesting, but I'm not sure yet how that mass relates to luminosity. Hmm, I remember that for stars, luminosity is connected to their radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of emission for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Both stars have the same peak wavelength, which implies the same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Now, the luminosities of these two stars would be based on their radii and temperatures. Since both have the same T, but different radii, then L is proportional to R². So let me think: L1 = 4πσ R1² T^4, L2 = 4πσ R2² T^4. Since T is the same for both, the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1²) / (R2²).

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So (R1/R2)^2 is (1.5)^2=2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2.

Wait, but the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of which option? The options have A) ~2.25, which would be the straightforward answer if all other factors are equal.

But wait, the problem also gives the radial velocities. The radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, and Star_2
