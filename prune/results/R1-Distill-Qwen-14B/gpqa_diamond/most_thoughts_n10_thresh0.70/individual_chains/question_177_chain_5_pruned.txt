Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through. Let's read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses; Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the brightest wavelength is the peak emission, right? So that's probably due to their temperatures. Oh, right, because blackbody radiation peaks at a wavelength given by Wien's Law. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because Wien's Law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T. So same lambda_max means same T.

Next, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Not sure how that ties in yet, but maybe it's about Doppler shift or affecting the observed wavelength? Wait, but the problem says they computed the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest. Oh, wait, but the question says that the astronomers found the same wavelengths for both stars' maxima. So perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh! So maybe we have to correct for that. Because if a star is moving, its emitted wavelengths could be shifted, but the question says their observed maxima are the same. So perhaps we need to find the intrinsic temperature, considering any Doppler shifts.

Wait, but Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0. So its light isn't Doppler shifted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So for Star_2, the observed wavelength would be different from the emitted one. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So maybe Star_2's observed peak is the same as Star_1's, which is not shifted because Star_1 isn't moving. Therefore, Star_2's actual emitted peak must be shifted to match Star_1's. But wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocities affect other factors. But wait, the problem says that the astronomers calculated the lumin
