Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with toluene. The process goes through three steps, and I need to find the molecular symmetry group of the final product. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a different symmetry group.

First, I need to outline each step:

1. Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid to form product 1.
2. Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to form product 2.
3. Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3.

Finally, I need to determine the symmetry group of product 3.

Let me break down each reaction step by step.

Step 1: Toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitric acid in sulfuric acid is a typical nitrating mixture. Toluene undergoes nitration. The nitration of toluene occurs in the para position because the methyl group is an activating group, and the nitro group is a meta-directing group. Wait, wait, no. Toluene has a methyl group which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Nitration would typically occur at the para position, but could also be at ortho. However, in reality, para is the major product. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, but sometimes, when the substituents are such that ortho is not possible, maybe the product is only para. So yeah, product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Step 2: Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially under acidic conditions. I recall that in the oxidation of nitrotoluenes, the amine group (if present) would be oxidized, but wait, nitrotoluene is an aromatic compound with a nitro group. Oh wait, no, toluene is methylbenzene. So nitrotoluene has a NO2 group and a CH3 group attached to the benzene.

Wait, no. Wait, toluene is benzene with a methyl group. When we nitrate it, we
