Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin 1/2 particle and the oscillation of its magnetic moment after a change in the magnetic field direction. Alright, I need to recall what I know about spin systems and magnetic moments.

So the setup is this: the particle has a magnetic moment mu = gamma * S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is switched off and turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, wait. Let me think about spin in a magnetic field. I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque which causes it to precess. For a spin-½ particle, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator.

In the initial state, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is aligned along +Z. That would be the ground state, I suppose. The energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect. The energy is E = -mu · B, so for spin up in Z direction, E = -gamma * B * (1/2), maybe? Wait, spin 1/2, so S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So mu_z = gamma * (ħ/2) for spin up. So E = - mu_z * B = - gamma * (ħ/2) * B. But maybe the exact value of energy isn't needed for this problem.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off. Wait, no, the field is turned off and then turned on along +Y. Oh, so initially, it's along Z, then switched to Y. So the field is changing direction.

Wait, the question says the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So we're looking at <mu_z> over time.

Hmm, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The initial state is probably the eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian (along Z), but after the change, it's no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian (along Y). So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's say it's spin-up along Z. After the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B'. Since the field is along Y, B' = B
