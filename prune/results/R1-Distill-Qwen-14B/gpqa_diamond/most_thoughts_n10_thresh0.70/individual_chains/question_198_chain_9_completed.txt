Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of equilibrium questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt(II) complex in solution. The setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants... right, they're the equilibrium constants for the formation of complexes. So, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN⁻ ions attached.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. So that would be the species with two SCN⁻ ions, which is n=2. So we need to find the fraction of Co²+ that's in the form of Co(SCN)₂²+.

Hmm, but wait, the problem mentions "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN⁻ groups. So the species we're interested in is the one with two SCN⁻ ligands. So that's the second complex, Co(SCN)₂²+.

I remember that for such calculations, we often use the concept of the distribution of metal ions among different complexes. The idea is that the concentrations of each complex are related by the stability constants, and the total concentration of the metal is the sum of all the species present.

Let me recall the general approach. The metal ion can form complexes with different numbers of ligands. The stability constants (β) increase up to a certain point and then may decrease, depending on the ligand's behavior. But in this case, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, β4 is lower than β3. That might be important because it suggests that the most stable complex is the one with three SCN⁻ ions, as β3 is the highest.

But the question is specifically about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 species. So we need to find [Co(SCN)₂²+] divided by the total cobalt species.

The approach is probably using the stability constants and the ligand concentration to find the distribution of each species.

I think the way to do this is to use the concept of the formation of each complex step-wise. The formation of each complex depends on the previous one. So for each step, you can write the formation equation.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to model this using the fraction of each species. The fraction of each species depends on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Let me think about the general formula for the fraction of each complex. For a metal ion M and ligand L, the fraction of the complex MLn is given by (βn [L]^n) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1β2...βn [L]^n).

Wait, alternatively, the fraction of each species can be determined by considering the step-wise formation constants. The step-wise formation constant is the constant for adding one more ligand. So for the first ligand, β1 is the step-wise constant. For the second, β2=K2 = β1β2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the overall βn is the product of the step-wise K's. So for a complex with n ligands, βn = K1 * K2 * ... * Kn.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the β's are given as the overall stability constants, not the step-wise. So the β1 is the formation constant for CoSCN⁺, β2 is for Co(SCN)₂²+, etc.

So the general approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on the overall βn and the ligand concentration.

The formula for the fraction of each species is (βn [SCN⁻]^n) / sum from i=0 to 4 (βi [SCN⁻]^i), where i=0 is the free Co²+ ion.

Wait, but wait, no. Because each βi represents the formation of the complex with i SCN⁻ ions. So the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all species: [Co²+] + [CoSCN⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂²+] + [Co(SCN)3³+] + [Co(SCN)4^4+].

But the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all these species.

But when considering the distribution, we can model the fraction of each species as (βi [SCN⁻]^i) divided by the sum of all such terms from i=0 to 4.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think. The fraction of the nth complex is (βn [L]^n) divided by the sum from k=0 to n of βk [L]^k.

But wait, the stability constants are the overall constants, not step-wise. So to calculate the fractions, we can use the following formula:

For each species CoL_k where k is the number of ligands (ranging from 0 to 4), the fraction f_k is (β_k [L]^k) / Σ (from m=0 to 4) (β_m [L]^m )

Wait, but β_0 is 1, since [Co²+] (k=0) is β0=1. Because the formation constant for the complex with 0 ligands is 1. So in our case, β0 is 1, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So the denominator is sum_{k=0 to 4} βk [L]^k.

So the fraction f_2 (for k=2) is (β2 [L]^2) / (sum from k=0 to4 βk [L]^k )

But wait, [L] is the concentration of free ligand. But in this problem, the [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. Hmm, but wait, when the ligand concentration is high, the metal tends to form higher complexes. But in this case, since the solution has a fixed [SCN⁻], we can treat it as a constant (since the concentration is given and the volume is presumably large enough that the ligand isn't depleted by complex formation).

Wait, but is that a valid assumption? Because when calculating the fraction, the ligand's concentration is considered, but when the ligand is in excess, the [L] can be approximated as the initial concentration.

So in this problem, [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, so we can proceed with that.

So the denominator becomes 1 + β1 [L] + β2 [L]^2 + β3 [L]^3 + β4 [L]^4.

Plugging in the numbers:

[L] = 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term:

Term0: β0 [L]^0 = 1 * 1 = 1

Term1: β1 [L]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2: β2 [L]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4

Term3: β3 [L]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

Term4: β4 [L]^4=16 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001=0.0016

Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = Let's calculate that.

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 + 0.4=2.3

2.3 + 0.063=2.363

2.363 + 0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is approximately 2.3646.

The term for f_2 is term2=0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that. 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ ?

Well, 2.3646 is approximately 2.365.

0.4 ÷ 2.365.

Let me compute 0.4 / 2.365.

2.365 × 0.169 ≈ 0.4 (since 2.365 × 0.169 ≈ 0.4).

Wait, 2.365 × 0.169: 2.365 * 0.16 is 0.3784, and 0.009*2.365=0.021285. So total is approximately 0.3997, which is about 0.4.

So 0.4 / 2.365 ≈ 0.169, so f_2 is approximately 16.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. And the calculation gives about 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes these things can be tricky.

Let me recompute the denominator:

Term0: 1 → 1

Term1: 9 * 0.1=0.9 → sum is 1+0.9=1.9

Term2:40*(0.1)^2=40 * 0.01=0.4 → sum 1.9+0.4=2.3

Term3:63 * 0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363

Term4:16*(0.1)^4 =16*0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

Then the term for k=2 is 0.4.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.4 divided by 2.3646.

Calculating 2.3646 × 0.169 = ?

0.169 × 2 = 0.338

0.169 × 0.3646 ≈ 0.0617

So 0.338 + 0.0617 = 0.3997, which is approximately 0.4.

So 0.169 times 2.3646 is about 0.4.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.169, or 16.9%.

But wait, why is the fraction so low even though β3 is the highest? Because β3 is 63, which is higher than β2=40, so the fraction for k=3 should be higher than k=2. Similarly, k=4 has β4=16, which is lower than β3 but higher than β2.

Wait, so perhaps the fraction for k=3 is higher than k=2. Let me check the fractions for all:

f_0: 1/(2.3646) ≈ 0.422 → 42.2%

f_1: 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.38 → 38%

f_2: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈16.9%

f_3: 0.063 /2.3646 ≈ 2.66%

f_4: 0.0016 /2.3646≈ 0.067%

So the largest fraction is f_0 (42.2%)? That can't be right because β3 is the highest. Wait, but why?

Wait, maybe the ligand concentration affects this more than the β's. Because the ligand is 0.1 M, which is relatively low. So perhaps the higher complexes aren't that populated.

Wait, but if the ligand is more abundant, higher complexes form more. So here, with [SCN−] = 0.1 M, which is 0.1, perhaps the complexes don't form as much. So most of the cobalt remains as Co²+ (free ion) because the ligand isn't very concentrated.

Wait, but in this case, the total Co is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M. So the ligand is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher than the Co concentration.

Hmm, but stability constants are large, so even with ligand at 0.1 M, perhaps higher complexes form.

Wait, but the way the fractions are calculated, the denominator is sum of all βk [L]^k terms. So when the ligand is high, the βk [L]^k terms for higher k may dominate.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator with [L]=0.1.

Wait, with [L] =0.1, the terms are:

Term0: 1

Term1: 9 *0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9

Term2:40*(0.01)=0.4 → sum 2.3

Term3:63*0.001=0.063 → sum 2.363

Term4:16*0.0001=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

So the fraction for k=3 is 0.063 / 2.3646 ≈0.0266, or about 2.66%.

So the highest fraction is k=0, which is 42.2%, then k=1 (38%), then k=2 (16.9%), and the rest are much smaller.

Wait, but if β3 is 63, which is the highest, why is the fraction for k=3 so low? Because even though β3 is high, [L]^3 is low since [L] is 0.1.

Wait, let's see: [L]^3 is 0.1^3 = 0.001. So β3 [L]^3 is 63 * 0.001=0.063.

Compare that to β2 [L]^2:40 *0.01=0.4.

So β3 [L]^3 is 0.063, which is less than β2 [L]^2.

So even though β3 is higher, because [L] is lower, the product is less than β2's product.

So the fraction for k=2 is higher than k=3.

Hmm, so the dithiocyanato complex (k=2) has a higher fraction than the trithiocyanato (k=3) in this case.

So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the options are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So the answer would be D.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, earlier I thought the dithiocyanato is k=2, which is 16.9%. But wait, what if the blue complex is another species?

Wait, no, the question states 'blue dithiocyanato' which is the one with two SCN⁻ groups. So the calculation seems correct.

But wait, let me think again. Did I correctly model the fractions? Because sometimes, when the ligand concentration is high, higher complexes form more, but in this case, with [SCN⁻]=0.1 M, perhaps the ligand is not very high.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator should be the sum of all possible species, including the higher complexes beyond n=4, but the problem states the stability constants up to β4, so perhaps n=4 is the maximum.

So I think my approach is correct, and the answer is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex (Co(SCN)₂²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the ligand concentration. The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate (SCN⁻) concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:

\[
f_k = \frac{\beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

Here, \( f_2 \) corresponds to the fraction of Co(SCN)₂²⁺. The denominator is the sum of all terms \(\beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k\) for \(k = 0\) to \(k = 4\). The calculations for each term are as follows:

- Term₀: \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1\)
- Term₁: \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9\)
- Term₂: \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4\)
- Term₃: \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063\)
- Term₄: \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

The denominator is the sum of these terms:

\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\(f_2\)) is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is:

\[
f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

This corresponds to option D. The other options are inconsistent with the calculated fraction.

Answer: D
