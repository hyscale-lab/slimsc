Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The problem states that because of these spots, when the star rotates, we observe periodic brightness variations. The situation is similar to what an exoplanet would cause when it transits in front of the star. But the question is, if there were no spots, what would be the radius of a planet needed to produce the same brightness variation?

Hmm. So the key here is to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar, where Rpl is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. The amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip in light) depends on the size of the blocking object relative to the star.

Wait, right. When a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is roughly equal to the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk. Because area is proportional to the square of the radius, the formula is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So when the spots rotate into and out of view, it affects the brightness. The problem says that the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, but only one hemisphere is spotty. So how does that affect the observed brightness variation?

Let me think. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the side facing us (the near side), they make the star appear a bit dimmer. When the star rotates and the spots are on the far side, more of the hotter (unspotted) surface is visible, making the star brighter. Wait, no, actually, when a spot is facing us, it's a cooler region, so the star's brightness would dip a little, but when the spot is on the far side, the other side (with the same amount of spots) would be visible, but wait, no, because only one hemisphere is spotty.

Wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered in spots, with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots take up 20% of that hemisphere. So the hemisphere without spots is spot-free, and the other is
