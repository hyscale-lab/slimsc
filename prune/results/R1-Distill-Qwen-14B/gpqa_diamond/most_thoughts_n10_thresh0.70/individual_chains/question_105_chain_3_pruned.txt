Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could mimic an exoplanet transit. But the question is, if instead, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness dip, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star?

Hmm, wait. So the problem is about photometric variations—so it's about the change in brightness. When a planet transits in front of a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. But wait, in this case, the star has spots which themselves cause a variation in brightness, so we need to compare the amplitude of that variation to what a planet would cause.

Wait, but the question says that the situation with the spots can closely resemble an exoplanet. So without the spots, what would the exoplanet's radius have to be to produce the same amplitude in brightness changes.

Wait, but the spots are causing a dip in brightness when they're facing us. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, making the star appear dimmer. The amount of dimming depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

So the key here is to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, then determine the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

Let me think about how the brightness variation works.

When a star has spots, the total brightness we observe depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the rest of the star. So the spots are darker, so they contribute less light.

The formula for the brightness variation would be related to the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when parts of the star are cooler, the total observed luminosity is less.

The filling factor (f) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Here, it's 20%, so f=0.2. But wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered," so does that mean the filling factor is 0.2 for that hemisphere? Or is the total area of spots 0.2 times the entire star's area?

Wait, the problem says the star's radius is equal to the Sun's, but one hemisphere has dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²/2) )= 0.2 * π R². Wait, because a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So total area of spots is 0.2 * (π R²) = 0.2 π R².

Wait, let me clarify. The star's total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR²
