Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about heating a mixture of salts and then some reactions happening through different tubes. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total weight is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200Â°C without air, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three tubes.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent, I think. Then tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution, so that's probably for absorbing CO2 or something acidic. Tube 3 has red-hot copper, so that's likely for reacting with something like sulfur dioxide or maybe another gas.

The results: Tube 1 gains 3.60 grams. Tube 3 gains 0.80 grams, and tube 2 doesn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure (which is 22.4 L/mol, so maybe 0.1 mol?).

Let me think about what each tube does. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, so it absorbs water. So if the gas from the salts has water vapor, tube 1 would gain that. So the 3.60g increase is probably water. So that's 3.60g H2O. Let me calculate moles: H2O has molar mass 18g/mol. 3.6 / 18 = 0.2 moles of H2O.

Then tube 3 is red-hot copper. I remember that CO2 doesn't react with copper, but maybe SO3 or something else would. Wait, no, CO2 won't react with red-hot copper. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with H2S? No, I'm getting confused. Another possibility is that the gas is SO2. Because when SO2 is passed over hot copper, it might be oxidized. Wait, SO2 can be oxidized to SO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a sulfur-containing gas.

Wait, let's think again. The tube 3's weight increases by 0.80g. So whatever reacts here produces some solid. Since Cu is red-hot, perhaps it's oxidizing a gas. For example, CO would react with Cu to form CO2 and CuO? Wait, no, that's not right. Or maybe the gas is H2S, but I don't think that's likely. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with another gas like NH3, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, another approach: the reaction in tube 3 produces CuO. So the gas must be something that can oxidize Cu. But Cu is in the +2 oxidation state in CuO, so the gas might be a reducing agent. Like H2, which would reduce CuO to Cu and form H2O. But in that case, the product would be water, which would go to tube 1, not tube 3. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the gas is SO2. When SO2 is passed over red-hot copper, it might react to form CuS or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with O2, but that's not likely. Another thought: maybe the gas is a halogen, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is CO2, but that wouldn't react with copper. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with another gas. Wait, another angle: the gases after tube 1 and 2 go into tube 3, so the gas that reacts in tube 3 is whatever is left after the previous tubes. Let's think: tube 1 absorbs water, tube 2 would absorb CO2, perhaps. So if the original gas mixture has H2O, CO2, and another gas, then tube 1 takes H2
