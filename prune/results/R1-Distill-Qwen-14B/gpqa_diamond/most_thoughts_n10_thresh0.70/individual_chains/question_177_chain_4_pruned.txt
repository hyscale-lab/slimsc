Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. And the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The task is to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4πR²σT^4, right? Where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L depends on R squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem mentions radial velocities. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight, which causes a Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards us or away from us, its observed wavelength changes. The star with a higher radial velocity is moving faster relative to us. But how does that affect the observed wavelength where they appear brightest?

Oh, right. The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the stars have the same observed peak wavelength, that must mean their temperatures (as observed) are the same. But wait, no—because if the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted due to the Doppler effect. So the actual temperature of each star might be different, but their observed peak wavelengths are the same.

So we need to correct for the Doppler shift. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength is λ = λ0 (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity. But wait, I think the formula is different depending on whether the star is moving towards or away. Oh right, the full formula is λ = λ0 * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, no, I think it's λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for relativistic speeds, but maybe for smaller velocities, we can approximate it. But wait, 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light (c is ~3e5 km/s). So maybe the approximation is okay.

Alternatively, the Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds is λ ≈ λ0 (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think: when a star is moving away, the wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the observed λ is λ0*(1 + v/c). Wait, but in the case where the star is moving towards us, v is negative, so the observed λ is shorter (blue shifted).

Wait, but in the problem
