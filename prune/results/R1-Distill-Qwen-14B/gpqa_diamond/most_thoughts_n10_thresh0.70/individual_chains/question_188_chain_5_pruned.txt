Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and calculating the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let me think this through.

So, the crystal is rhombohedral, which I remember is a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system. Oh wait, no, I think it's a separate system. Anyway, the key thing is that all the edges are equal, and the angles between them are the same. In this case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms.

Wait, interatomic distance... so the lattice parameter, a, is 10 Angstroms. Because in a rhombohedral lattice, all edges are the same length. So a = 10.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (2hk cos alpha + 2hk cos beta + 2hl cos gamma) ) ). Wait, is that right? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, no. Alternatively, I think the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos γ + 2kl cos β ), but wait, in a rhombohedral
