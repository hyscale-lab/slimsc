Okay, let's try to figure this problem out step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A (C3H6) and going through several transformations to end up with compound H. We have to identify the incorrect statement about the products.

First, I'll try to break down each step and figure out the structures of each compound.

1. **Compound A is C3H6.** What could that be? Well, the molecular formula C3H6 has a degree of unsaturation of (2*3 +2 -6)/2 = (8-6)/2=1. So, one ring or one double bond. But C3H6 can be either propene (an alkene) or cyclopropane (a ring). But in the context of bromination with CCl4, I think it's more likely propene because cyclopropane is more strained and less reactive for addition reactions. So, A is propene.

2. **Bromination of propene in CCl4.** Propene (CH2=CH2CH3) undergoes bromination via an addition reaction. The bromine (Br2) in CCl4 adds across the double bond. So, the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3), which is compound B.

3. **Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH.** Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, B is a dibromide. When a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Br atoms) reacts with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes elimination. The reaction is dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, the elimination would form propene again. Wait, but wait—actually, the structure of B would have Br on carbons 1 and 2. Upon elimination, we lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond. The possible alkenes are 1-propene or 2-propene (but that's the same as propene since it's a three-carbon chain). So, compound C is propene again. Wait, but propene is a gas, so D says C is a flammable gas. That would make sense because propene is a gas at room temperature.

4. **Passing C through a red-hot iron tube.** Red-hot iron usually causes decomposition or possibly a rearrangement. Alternatively, it could be a dehydrogenation reaction. Wait, propene (CH2=CH2CH3) when passed over hot iron might undergo a reaction. Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but no, C is propene. Alternatively, propene might undergo some isomerization? Wait, another thought: Maybe when propene is passed over red-hot iron, it could form something like acetylene. Because heating with a catalyst might cause further elimination. Wait, propene has one double bond. To form acetylene (C3H4), we need two double bonds. So, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but wait, C is just propene. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. If C is propene (CH2=CHCH3), and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of hydrogenation, but that would require H2 and a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation. Wait, propene (CH2=CHCH3) upon heating with iron might form something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a thermal decomposition. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration, but that's not applicable here since C is already an alkene.

Wait, another approach: What happens when propene is heated with a metal like iron. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) would be the product if we lose H2. But the formula would change. Let's check the molecular formula. Propene is C3H6. To form propyne (C3H4), two Hs are lost. So, maybe that's what's happening. So, compound D would be propyne (prop-1-yne), which is an alkyne.

5. **Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids.** Hmm, two strong acids—could be sulfuric and nitric acid, which is a mixture for nitrating. But wait, another possibility is H2SO4 and HNO3 for nitration. Alternatively, perhaps it's reacting with H2SO4 and another acid for some other reaction. Let's think about the reaction of an alkyne with strong acids. Maybe it's a hydration reaction. Oh wait, but with strong acids, perhaps sulfuric acid is used as a catalyst in hydration. When an alkyne is treated with H2O in the presence of H2SO4, it can form ketones or carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) upon hydration (with HgSO4 and H2SO4) would form acetone (propan-2-one, (CH3)2CO). Alternatively, under different conditions, perhaps it adds H2O across the triple bond, giving a ketone.

Wait, but the question says a mixture of two strong acids. Maybe it's H2SO4 and HNO3. Wait, another possibility is that D is reacting with concentrated sulfuric acid and another acid for some kind of nitration or sulfonation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation but that's more for alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe D is being subjected to hydrohalogenation. But D is an alkyne, so adding HX. But the question says a mixture of two strong acids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diaddition reaction. Wait, if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), and it's treated with H2SO4 and HNO3, which could be a nitrating mixture. But alkyne nitration is possible. Let's see: Propyne (HC≡CCH3) can undergo nitration to form propionyl nitrate, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne adds two nitro groups.

Wait, maybe I should think about the next steps. Compound E is formed when D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. Then, E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Let's think about what E could be.

Wait, if D is propyne, and when it reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it undergoes hydration to form acetone. Then E would be acetone. Then, when E is treated with iron and HCl, perhaps it's a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So, acetone would become propane (CH3CH2CH3). But then, propane is an alkane, but would it react with nitrous acid? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Let me re-examine step 4.

Wait, after step 3, compound C is propene. When it passes through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a hydrogenation to form propane. But propene is CH2=CH2CH3; adding H2 would make it CH2CH2CH3, but that's propane. But I don't think that's the case because the question says 'red-hot iron tube'—maybe it's a catalyst for something else. Alternatively, perhaps the propene is being dehydrohalogenated further, but it already is an alkene, so perhaps it's a di-elimination. Wait, but propene is CH2=CHCH3, so another elimination would require more HX groups, which it doesn't have. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps step 4 is a dehydrogenation reaction. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) has one double bond. To form an alkyne, it would need to lose another H. So, maybe when heated with Fe, it forms propyne (HC≡CCH3) by losing H2. So D is propyne.

Then, step 5: D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids to form E. Let's think about propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacting with H2SO4 and HNO3. Alternatively, maybe it's H2SO4 and HCl. Wait, in presence of H2SO4, maybe propyne undergoes hydration to form a ketone. The hydration of terminal alkynes like propyne can form ketones. Propyne + H2O (catalyzed by HgSO4) would form acetone (propan-2-one). So E is acetone.

Then, step 6: E reacts with iron scrap and HCl to form F. Iron and HCl would provide H+ and Cl- ions. Iron in presence of HCl can act as a reducing agent. Wait, for the Clemmensen reduction, you have Zn(Hg) and HCl, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But here, it's iron scrap and HCl. Maybe it's a similar reaction. So acetone (a ketone) would be reduced to propane (CH3CH2CH3). But then F would be propane, which is an alkane. But then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid (HNO2) typically reacts with alkanes? No, more likely with alkenes or alkynes. Wait, but F is an alkane here, so maybe I'm wrong.

Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach for step 5.

Alternatively, maybe D is propene (from step 3), and step 4 is a process that doesn't change it. Wait, but step 4 says passing through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but C is already propene. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe compound A is not propene but cyclopropane. But cyclopropane would be more strained and less reactive for bromination. Also, bromination of cyclopropane would be more likely to be substitution, but typically, cyclopropane is unreactive towards addition reactions because the ring is too strained. So perhaps A is indeed propene.

So, back to step 5. If E is acetone, then F would be propane, which is an alkane, and then reacting with nitrous acid wouldn't do much. So perhaps I'm missing something. Another possibility is that in step 5, the strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and the reaction is a nitration.

Wait, propyne (HC≡CCH3) can undergo nitration to form a nitropropyne. But I'm not sure about the specific product. Maybe the triple bond undergoes nitration to form a nitro group. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydration, but I'm stuck.

Wait, let me think about the next step. Compound E, when treated with iron and HCl, forms F. So if E is a ketone (like acetone), then F would be propane after Clemmensen reduction. Then, F is propane (C3H8). But propane doesn't react with nitrous acid (HNO2), which typically reacts with amines, alcohols, or possibly alkenes. Wait, but HNO2 is a strong acid and can be a source of NO+ which may react with certain compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Let me think of another possibility. Step 5: D is propyne reacting with two strong acids. Maybe H2SO4 and H2SO4? No, that's not two. Alternatively, H2SO4 and HNO3. Maybe it's sulfonation—propyne doesn't typically undergo sulfonation. Or perhaps the alkyne is protonated and then undergoes some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps E is an acid derivative. Wait, another thought: Maybe D is propyne, and when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid and another acid, it's a hydration to form a carbonyl. So E would be acetone. Then F would be propane after reduction.

But then, F is propane (C3H8), which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me reevaluate step 4.

Wait, another possibility: After step 3, compound C is propene. Then, in step 4, when passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, which would add H2 to the double bond, making propane. So D would be propane (C3H8). Then, step 5: D (propane) reacts with two strong acids. Hmm, what reaction would that be? Maybe it's a sulfonation, but alkanes don't react with strong acids. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 acting as a nitrating agent, but alkanes don't nitrate easily. So this doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps step 4 is a dehydrogenation, converting propene into something else. Wait, perhaps D is propene, and then in step 5, it undergoes hydration to form propane-2-ol? But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me consider the next steps, as sometimes looking ahead can help.

After step 5, E is formed, then reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. Then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If F is an amine, perhaps, then G could be a diazonium salt, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps E is a nitrated compound, like a nitroalkane. Then, when F is treated with iron and HCl, perhaps it undergoes reduction. For example, nitropropane (CH2CH2CH3NO2) could be reduced to propane amine (CH2CH2CH3NH2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diacid, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should start by listing all the options and see which one is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
Option B) H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride.
Option C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR.
Option D) C is a flammable gas.

Let me go through each option.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is indeed a gas at room temperature and highly flammable. So D is correct. So the statement is correct, which means the incorrect option isn't D.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propyne, which is HC≡CCH3, the structure would have two sets of protons. The terminal H is a triple bond, so it's a singlet. The methyl group (CH3) is attached to the carbon next to the triple bond. The CH3 would be a singlet as well because all three Hs are equivalent and have no neighboring Hs. So the NMR would show two singlets. Hence, statement C is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride reacts with SCN- to form a yellow precipitate. So H must be a thiocyanate or have an SCN group. If G is a thiocyanate, then when H is formed by reaction with NaOH, perhaps it's an elimination product. Alternatively, maybe H is a nitrile. Wait, let me think.

Let me go back to step 7: G is formed when F reacts with nitrous acid. If F is a primary amine, then nitrous acid would convert it to a diazonium salt, which upon heating would form a nitrile or a nitro compound. Alternatively, if F is a secondary amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps F is an alkane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should retrace the steps again more carefully.

Alternative approach:

A is propene (C3H6).

Step 1: Bromination → 1,2-dibromopropane (B).

Step 2: B + alcoholic KOH → elimination to form propene (C) again.

So C is propene, a gas, so statement D is correct.

Step 3: C passes through red-hot iron tube → forms D. If it's catalytic hydrogenation, D would be propane. If it's dehydrogenation to form an alkyne, D is propyne.

Assuming D is propyne.

Step 4: D reacts with two strong acids → forms E. If E is acetone (from hydration), then step 5: E treated with Fe and HCl → propane (F).

Then F is propane, which is an alkane.

Step 6: F reacts with nitrous acid → but alkanes don't react with HNO2. So this suggests that my assumption about D is incorrect, and perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alternative possibility for D: Maybe D is propane (C3H8) after hydrogenation. Then, step 5: D reacts with two strong acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the reaction in step 4 isn't hydrogenation but something else. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but C is propene, which doesn't have halogens. Alternatively, maybe it's a rearrangement. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe step 4 is a dehydration, but that doesn't make sense because C is already an alkene.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I'm not correctly identifying D. Let me think about what comes after step 5.

If D is propene, perhaps E is something else. Let me consider another possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps step 4 is an oxidation. Propene (C) could be oxidized to form something else. For example, using a hot iron catalyst, perhaps it's oxidized to form a diol or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 4 is a dehydrohalogenation again, but from where? Oh, wait, maybe C is not propene but a different compound. Let me re-examine step 2.

Wait, step 2: B is 1,2-dibromopropane, which when treated with alcoholic KOH undergoes elimination. The product could be propene. But wait, the structure of B is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Upon elimination, two Br and two H are removed. The possible products are 1-propene or 2-propene, but in a three-carbon chain, they're the same, so C is propene.

So, moving forward, perhaps the next step (step 4) is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Maybe D is propylene oxide, but I don't see how that would form from propene via a red-hot iron tube.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible reactions more thoroughly.

Another approach: Let's list the structures again.

A: C3H6 → propene.

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3).

C: propene (CH2=CHCH3).

D: ?

In step 4, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Maybe it's a hydrogenation catalyst, so D is propane.

Then, step 5: D (propane) reacts with two strong acids to form E. But what could that be? Maybe it's a sulfonation. But alkanes don't get sulfonated easily. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitration, but alkanes are not typically nitrated under normal conditions. So perhaps I'm wrong about D.

Alternative possibility: Maybe step 4 is a dehydrohalogenation, but propene doesn't have halogens, so that can't be. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form a triple bond. So D is propyne.

Then, step 5: D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Reacting with a mixture of two strong acids.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's H2SO4 and HNO3. Maybe D undergoes a nitration. Propyne could undergo nitration to form a nitropropyne, but I'm not certain about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is hydration to form a ketone. So E would be acetone.

Then, step 6: E (acetone) reacts with iron and HCl. This sounds like a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3).

Step 7: F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2). But alkanes don't react with HNO2. So perhaps I'm wrong about F.

Alternatively, perhaps F is not propane but something else. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step 5. If D is propyne, maybe the reaction with two strong acids isn't hydration. Maybe it's an addition of acid to the triple bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, and the reaction is a hydrohalogenation. But propyne is a terminal alkyne, so it would react with HCl to form CH2Cl-C≡CH, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps D isn't propyne but something else. Maybe I should think about step 4 again. If D is propane, as in hydrogenation, then step 5 would have to be a reaction that forms something else, but I'm stuck.

Let me try to think about the final steps. Suppose F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So that can't be right.

Alternative approach: Maybe E is something else. Let's think about another possibility.

Wait, after step 3, C is propene. Step 4: passing through red-hot iron tube. Perhaps it's a dehydrogenation to form acetylene. So D is propyne (HC≡CCH3).

Step 5: D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids. Maybe it's a hydration to form acetone (E is acetone).

Step 6: E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl → F is propane (CH3CH2CH3).

Step 7: F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid → no reaction. So, this suggests that perhaps I'm wrong about F.

Alternatively, perhaps F is not propane. Maybe step 6 is a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E isn't a ketone. Maybe D is propene, and step 5 is a different reaction. Let me think about what happens when propene reacts with two strong acids.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and step 5 is an oxidation. Propane can be oxidized to propanol or further, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a mixture of two carboxylic acids? No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option B states that H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. This suggests that H has a thiocyanate group (SCN-), as FeCl3 reacts with SCN- to give a red-brown color, but wait, the option says yellow. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Alternatively, if H is a nitrile, but nitriles don't react with FeCl3.

Alternatively, H could be a phenol derivative, but that's not part of the current sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a nitro compound, but nitro compounds don't react with FeCl3 to give color.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure of H.

If G is a nitrile, perhaps H is a sodium salt of a nitrile. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again.

Another Approach:

Let me try to outline the entire reaction sequence with the structures I think.

A: propene (CH2=CHCH3)

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)

C: propene (CH2=CHCH3) after elimination.

D: propyne (HC≡CCH3) after dehydrogenation.

E: acetone (CH3COCH3) after hydration.

F: propane (CH3CH2CH3) after reduction.

G: perhaps some reaction of propane with HNO2, but I don't know.

Wait, but F is propane, which is inert. So perhaps I'm wrong about E.

Alternative possibility for E: Maybe E is a diacid, but I don't see how that would form.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a nitrile. If D is propyne, and E is a nitrile, but how?

Wait, perhaps D is propyne, and in step 5, it reacts with H2SO4 and HNO3 to form a nitrile. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propyne, and in step 5, it's treated with a mixture of H2SO4 and H2O, leading to a ketone.

So, E is acetone.

Then, F would be propane after reduction.

But F doesn't react with HNO2.

So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another possibility: Maybe F is an amine. So, if E is a nitrated compound, perhaps F is an amine.

Wait, perhaps E is a nitropropane (CH2CH2CH3NO2).

Wait, how would that form? If D is propene, and step 5 is a nitration, but propene is hard to nitrate. Alternatively, if D is propane, which is hard to nitrate.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that H is a nitro compound, but that doesn't fit with the FeCl3 test.

Alternatively, perhaps H has a phenolic group, but that doesn't fit the steps.

Wait, let's think about each statement.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, then this would be incorrect because propane is a gas and not used for dyes. Alternatively, if F is a different compound, like ethylene glycol or something else, maybe.

But in my earlier steps, F is propane, so statement A would be incorrect. But I'm not completely sure.

Wait, but let's go back to the options.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is a thiocyanate, but I don't see where thiocyanate would come from in this sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a nitro compound, but nitro compounds don't react with FeCl3 to give color.

Alternatively, perhaps H contains an aromatic ring, but I don't see that happening in the given steps.

Another possibility is that H is a ketone, which would show a yellow color, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a phenol, which would give a color with FeCl3, but I don't see a phenol in the steps.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), the H on the triple bond is a singlet (no neighboring H), and the CH3 group is also a singlet (all three H are equivalent and no neighboring H). So NMR would show two singlets. So option C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. Yes, propene is a gas and flammable. So D is correct.

So, the incorrect statement would be either A or B.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, that's not true. Propane is a fuel, not used in dye synthesis. So statement A would be incorrect.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is option B or A. Wait, but I thought H might be a nitro compound or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps again.

Let me try to proceed.

Assuming F is propane, and when it reacts with nitrous acid, perhaps nothing happens, so G would be propane, and H would be the same as G. But the steps require H to react with NaOH. Propane doesn't react with NaOH, so this suggests that my assumption about F is wrong.

Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Alternative approach:

Perhaps step 4 produces a different compound.

Wait, perhaps D is cyclopropane. But I don't see how propene would form cyclopropane upon passing through a red-hot iron tube.

Alternatively, perhaps step 4 is a dehydrohalogenation again, but I don't see the source of halogens.

Wait, maybe step 4 is a polymerization reaction, but that's unlikely under those conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propene again, and step 5 is a different reaction.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

If the incorrect statement is option B, then H doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a nitro compound, which doesn't react with FeCl3, making option B incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a nitrile, which doesn't react with FeCl3, so option B is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps H is an alkyne, which doesn't react with FeCl3, making option B incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps H is an alkane, which also doesn't react with FeCl3, making option B incorrect.

But I'm not certain.

Another approach: Let's think about each compound's structure and the options.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propyne (HC≡C-CH3), the NMR would have two singlets: the H on the triple bond (no adjacent H) and the CH3 group. So option C is correct.

Option A: F is used for dye synthesis. If F is propane, this is incorrect. So option A is incorrect.

So the incorrect statement is option A.

But wait, another possibility: Maybe F is something else. Let's retrace.

If E is a nitrile, then F could be a primary amine after reduction. But I don't see how E would be a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a ketone, and F is an amine. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about F again.

E is acetone (from propyne's hydration). F is propane after Clemmensen reduction. Propane is a gas, but not used for dyes.

So option A would be incorrect.

Thus, the incorrect statement is option B.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option again.

Option A: F is used for dye synthesis. If F is propane, this is wrong. So option A is incorrect.

But wait, another possibility: Maybe F is ethylene, which is used in some dye syntheses. But I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe F is something else, like an amine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sequence.

Alternative possibility:

After step 4, D is propyne. Step 5: D reacts with two strong acids, let's say H2SO4 and HNO3, leading to the formation of propionyl nitrate (a nitro compound). Then, step 6: E (propionyl nitrate) reacts with Fe and HCl. Maybe the nitrate group is reduced to an amine. So F would be propylamine (CH2CH2CH2NH2). Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt, which upon heating would form a nitrile (G is CH2CH2C≡N). Then, G reacts with NaOH. Nitriles hydrolyze in basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. So H would be CH2CH2COOH (propanoic acid).

Now, checking the options:

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. Propanoic acid is a carboxylic acid. FeCl3 reacts with thiocyanate, not with carboxylic acids. So H doesn't give a color with FeCl3. So option B would be incorrect.

Option A: F is propylamine, which is used in some dye syntheses. So option A is correct.

Option C: D is propyne, which gives two singlets in NMR. Correct.

Option D: C is propene, a flammable gas. Correct.

So the incorrect statement would be option B.

But wait, in this scenario, H is propanoic acid, which doesn't give a color with FeCl3, so option B is incorrect.

But earlier steps would have to support this. Let me verify.

So, step by step:

A: propene.

B: 1,2-dibromopropane.

C: propene again.

D: propyne.

E: propionyl nitrate (if nitrated).

F: propylamine (after reduction with Fe and HCl).

G: upon reaction with nitrous acid, forms diazonium salt, which upon heating forms propionitrile.

H: propionitrile hydrolyzes with NaOH to form propanoic acid.

So H is propanoic acid, which doesn't react with FeCl3 to give a color. So option B is incorrect.

So the incorrect statement is option B.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃). Bromination of propene in the presence of CCl₄ adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination of two molecules of HBr, regenerating propene (C), which is a flammable gas. 

When propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH₃), an alkyne (D). Propyne (D) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids (likely H₂SO₄ and H₂O) to undergo hydration, forming acetone (CH₃COCH₃), which is compound E. Acetone (E) is then reduced with iron scrap and HCl (Clemmensen reduction) to form propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃), which is compound F. Propane (F) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), but alkanes do not typically react with nitrous acid, suggesting a potential issue in this step. 

Finally, compound G is formed, and when G reacts with NaOH, it forms compound H. Based on the sequence, H is likely a carboxylic acid (e.g., propanoic acid), which does not react with FeCl₃ to give a yellow color. 

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.  
   If F is propane, this statement is incorrect because propane is a gas and not used for dye synthesis. However, if F were a different compound (e.g., an amine or nitrile), this statement could be correct.  

2. **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.  
   H is likely a carboxylic acid (e.g., propanoic acid), which does not react with FeCl₃ to give a yellow color. This statement is incorrect.  

3. **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra.  
   If D is propyne (HC≡CCH₃), the terminal H on the triple bond and the CH₃ group are both singlets. This statement is correct.  

4. **Option D**: C is a flammable gas.  
   C is propene, which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.  

### Conclusion:
The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as H does not give a yellow color with ferric chloride.
