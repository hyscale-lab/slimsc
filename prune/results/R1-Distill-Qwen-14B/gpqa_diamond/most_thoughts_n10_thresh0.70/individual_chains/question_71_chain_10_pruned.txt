Okay, so I have this problem about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh wait, right, it's based on the inverse square law because the planet's receiving light from the star, so the flux decreases with the square of the distance.

The question says there are five planets in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5. But I need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula. I think it's T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), or wait, maybe it's T = T_star * (Luminosity ratio)^(1/4) * (distance factor). Let me get this right. The formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), no, wait, that's for a planet's equilibrium temperature. Or maybe it's T = (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). But since all the planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ are constants. So the equilibrium temperature T
