Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I need to figure out what the problem is asking. The energy of the collider... Oh right, that's usually the kinetic energy, though sometimes people get confused between total energy and kinetic. But wait, in particle accelerators, the energy they refer to is often the kinetic energy. Or wait, no, sometimes it's the total energy. I think I need to be clear on that.

The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is Lithium. The atomic number for Lithium is 3, meaning it has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is 3 + 3 =6. So the nucleus is Li-6, right? So the mass of the nucleus would be 6 times the mass of a proton, but wait, actually, I should calculate the actual mass using the atomic masses or perhaps approximate using the proton mass. Wait, but wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses, but for heavy ions, perhaps we can approximate the mass as A times the mass of a proton. Or maybe better to use the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the mass of Li-6. But since I'm just a student, I might not have exact values on hand. Alternatively, I can use the formula that
