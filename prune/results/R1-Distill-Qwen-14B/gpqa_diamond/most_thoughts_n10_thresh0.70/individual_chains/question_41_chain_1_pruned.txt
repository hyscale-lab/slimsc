Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The options are given, and c is taken as 1.

Wait, so I remember that when dealing with light in different media, the index of refraction comes into play. The speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right?

But in this case, the glass is moving. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them at velocity v. So I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, perhaps using the relativistic Doppler effect or something like that. Or maybe it's about the velocity transformation between frames.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So light's speed is always c in any inertial frame, right? But that's in vacuum. Wait, no, because in this problem, the light is moving through a medium (glass) which has its own index of refraction. So how does the glass's motion affect the speed measured by the observer?

Wait, so normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the
