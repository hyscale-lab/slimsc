Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass is moving too. So I need to consider both the medium's motion and the light's speed within that medium.

The problem states that the glass has an index of refraction n. In a stationary medium, the speed of light v_light would be c divided by n, right? Since c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which here is given as 1. So normally, v_light = 1/n.

But the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me reread the question.

Oh wait, the light beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. But the glass is moving toward the observer? Wait, no, the entire setup is in a lab frame. So the glass is moving, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, maybe the observer is in the lab, which is different from the glass's frame. So the glass is moving
