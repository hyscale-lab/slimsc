Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember it's related to semiconductors and current-voltage behavior. The question is about when the equation is valid. Let me think.

The Mott-Gurney equation is used in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. I think that means when the device's operation is limited by the accumulation of charge, so the electric field is created by the space charge itself rather than an external voltage. Right, in this regime, the current isn't just due to the applied voltage anymore because the charge builds up.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). I remember that in the SCLC regime, the current is proportional to the square of the voltage. But wait, what conditions does this equation hold under?

Looking at the options, each talks about different device characteristics. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Ohmic contact implies that the work function is matched, so there's no barrier for carriers. Single-carrier means only electrons or holes contribute. Trap-free suggests that once carriers are in the conduction band, they don't get stuck. Negligible drift current—wait, but in SCLC, I thought drift is important. Or maybe in another regime, like when there's no space charge, drift is the main thing. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Or perhaps in SCLC, the current is due to the space charge's electric field, which is different from the usual drift driven by an external field.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. No carrier injection barrier would imply Ohmic contact, similar to A. No traps, so carriers move freely. Negligible diffusion current—so drift dominates. Wait, in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, which implies that the injection is the rate-limiting step. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: Single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contact has a barrier. So the carriers have to overcome this barrier. But in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, so the contact type might influence the conditions. But if it's a Schottky contact, there's a barrier, so maybe it's more about injection or extraction. Wait, but Mott-Gurney is more about when the space charge dominates, so maybe the contact type affects how the current is established. Also, if it's a single-carrier, then it's either electrons or holes, but I'm not sure how the contact type affects the validity of the equation.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion. Two-carrier implies both electrons and holes are involved. But I thought Mott-Gurney applies to single-carrier devices. Or wait, no—maybe in some cases two-carrier devices can be modeled similarly. Or perhaps Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier. I think so. Because the equation seems to be for a one-dimensional case, assuming only one type of carrier contributes.

So let's think about the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation. From what I recall, it's applicable when the current is limited by the space charge, which is the case when the electric field is determined by the space charge itself. This occurs when the injection is such that the space charge's influence is significant. So for this, the device is typically single-carrier because otherwise, the presence of both electrons and holes might complicate things, especially in terms of charge neutrality.

Ohmic contacts would imply that there's no significant barrier for the carriers. So that the carriers can move freely without needing to overcome a large potential barrier. That would fit with the SCLC model because the charge injection isn't hindered, so the space charge builds up as current increases.

Wait, what about drift vs diffusion currents? In the SCLC regime, I think the current is due to the electric
