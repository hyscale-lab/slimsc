Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reactions with mCPBA and what products form, then their chromatography results. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think step by step.

First, the question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene each treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Both go to completion. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”standard (achiral) and chiral.

Wait, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? I remember it's used in epoxidation reactions. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But the stereochemistry must matter here because the starting alkenes are E and Z.

So, for each reaction, the starting material is a diene. Reaction 1 is E-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 is Z-oct-4-ene. Let me think about how the epoxidation proceeds.

Epoxidation with mCPBA typically proceeds via an electrocyclic opening. Oh wait, no, wait. mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The mechanism is a peracid adding across the double bond, followed by some steps to form the epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, right? So the geometry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, actually, the addition of the peracid (like mCPBA) to the double bond occurs in a way that the oxygen adds across the double bond with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. Because the peracid adds endo, the initial addition forms an intermediate which then forms the epoxide. So for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide would form with a certain configuration, and for a cis (Z) alkene, another configuration.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the transition state. The peracid adds to the alkene in a way that the new oxygen atoms are added with the same geometry. So if the starting alkene is trans (E), the two new single bonds would be on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide? Or is the epoxide always a certain configuration?

Wait, no, I think that the epoxidation with mCPBA tends to form the trans-dihydroxy intermediate, but wait, that's when considering the ring opening. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me get this straight.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The key here is that the addition is stereospecific. So if the starting alkene is E, the two oxygens in the epoxide will be on opposite faces. For a Z starting alkene, the oxygens will be on the same face. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let's think about it: the peracid adds in a cyclic transition state,
