Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined and their energy levels are quantized. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, but I need to figure out the correct one.

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so they are fermions, right? Because electrons, for example, have spin-1/2 and are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, that means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. So each particle must have a unique combination of quantum numbers, considering spin as well.

The well is one-dimensional, so each particle has a quantum number n, which is a positive integer. The energy levels are given by E_n = (n²)E, where E is the base energy unit defined as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So for each n, the energy is proportional to n squared.

But wait, since we have four particles, each with spin, each can have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states for each particle. So the total number of states available for each n is two.

But since the particles are identical fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So let me think about how the four particles fill up the energy levels.

In the ground state, we want the lowest possible energies. The first energy level is n=1, which can hold two particles (since spin up and down). The next is n=2, which can also hold two. But wait, with four particles, we can fill up n=1 and n=2 completely. No, wait, because each n can hold two particles (two spin states), so putting two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. But wait, that's four particles. So the ground state would have each particle in either n=1 or n=2, each with their spin states.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For n=1, two particles (spin up and down). For n=2, two more particles. So four particles total. Each in a unique state. So the ground state is when the particles are in n=1 and n=2
