Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain potential. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. I remember that in polar coordinates, the potential often separates into radial and angular parts. So maybe I can treat this as a two-dimensional problem with some kind of separation.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's factor out r². So, V(r,θ) = [1/2 + (3/2)cos²θ] * k r². Hmm, that looks like a combination of terms. Maybe I can rewrite this as something that resembles a harmonic oscillator potential but with an angular component.

I think I remember that when the potential has terms involving cos²θ, it suggests that the angular part might be related to a quantum harmonic oscillator. So perhaps the potential can be separated into radial and angular parts. Let me try to write V(r,θ) as something like (A r²) + (B r² cos²θ). Oh wait, that's exactly what's given. So the first term is (1/2)k r², and the second is (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Wait, but when working in polar coordinates, sometimes it's easier to express everything in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me think. Oh, right! Because in two dimensions, r² cos²θ is actually x². Because x = r cosθ, so x² = r² cos²θ. So the potential can be rewritten as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Since r² is x² + y². So let me substitute that.

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let's combine these terms. The x² terms are (1/2)k x² + (3/2)k x² = 2k x². And the y² term is (1/2)k y². So the potential becomes V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, so now the potential is a sum of two different harmonic potentials along x and y directions. So that would imply that the problem is separable into x and y parts. Because the Hamiltonian would be H = p_x²/(2m) + p_y²/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So each direction can be treated as a harmonic oscillator.

Wait, but the standard harmonic oscillator in one dimension has a potential (1/2) m ω² x², and the energy levels are (n + 1/2)ℏω. So in each direction, the potential coefficients would determine the angular frequency.

So for the x direction: potential is 2k x². Let me write this as (1/2) m ω_x² x². Comparing 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x², so 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly for the y direction: (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y². So (1/2)k = (1/2) m ω_y² → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So each direction is a harmonic oscillator. The energy levels will be the sum of the energies in each direction. So the total energy E is E_x + E_y.

E_x is (n_x + 1/2)ℏ ω_x. E_y is (n_y + 1/2)ℏ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x and ω_y:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) → 2(n_x + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)
E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

So total energy E = 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y +1/2) multiplied by ℏ sqrt(k/m). Let me compute the constants:

E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m)
Wait, 2(n_x + 1/2) is 2n_x +1, and (n_y +1/2) is n_y +1/2. So adding them gives 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). Looking at the options, option C is E=(2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches.

Wait, let me double-check. The potential in x is 2k x^2, so (1/2)mω_x^2 = 2k. So ω_x^2 = (4k)/m → ω_x= 2 sqrt(k/m). So E_x= (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x → (n_x +1/2) * 2 sqrt(k/m) * ℏ → 2(n_x +1/2) sqrt(k/m) ℏ.

Similarly, E_y: (n_y +1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

Adding them: [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, let me compute 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) = 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So the answer should be C.


The potential is given as \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \frac{3}{2} k r^2 \cos^2\theta \). By expressing \( r^2 \cos^2\theta \) as \( x^2 \) (where \( x = r \cos\theta \)), the potential can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates as \( V(x, y) = 2k x^2 + \frac{1}{2}k y^2 \). This separates the problem into two independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

For the \( x \)-direction, the potential is \( 2k x^2 \), which corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels for this direction are \( E_x = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), where \( n_x \) is a non-negative integer.

For the \( y \)-direction, the potential is \( \frac{1}{2}k y^2 \), corresponding to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels for this direction are \( E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), where \( n_y \) is a non-negative integer.

The total energy is the sum of the energies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:

\[
E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Combining terms:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches option C.
