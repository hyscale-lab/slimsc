Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. We need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, pent-1-ene means there are five carbons with a double bond starting at the first carbon. The substituents on the double bond would be on the 1st and 2nd carbons. Wait, the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me count the carbons:

Pent-1-ene: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and a methyl group is on C3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, wait, no. Let me number the carbons correctly.

Carbon 1: CH₂=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: C(CH3)
Wait, maybe it's: CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would have a branch on the third carbon. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or is that right? Wait, no. Wait, the double bond is between 1 and 2, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)? No, that doesn't add up because pent would have five carbons total.

Wait, wait. Let's think of the structure. The molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. The parent chain is pentene, with the double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because then it would be pent-1-ene with a methyl on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the third in the chain. Let me
