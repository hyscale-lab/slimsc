Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about creating a mouse embryonic chimera using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Hmm, let me think step by step.

The setup is that they're using iPSCs from various somatic tissues. Each of these cells has a mRaspberry label under a lineage-specific promoter. So, mRaspberry is a fluorescent marker, probably red since it's a type of fluorescent protein. The idea is that each cell type (like maybe neurons, muscle cells, etc.) will express mRaspberry because the promoter is specific to their lineage.

They inject these dedifferentiated cells into a 32-cell stage blastocyst. Wait, no, wait. The blastocyst is the early embryo at that stage. So, the iPSCs are being introduced into the blastocyst to create a chimera. Chimeras are organisms with cells from two or more different genetic sources. So the injected cells would contribute to various tissues in the developing embryo.

They're tracking the fate of these iPSCs over 48 hours, and every 12 hours they prepare embryos with TUNEL-FITC staining. TUNEL is a method used to detect apoptosis. FITC is a green fluorescent dye, so the cells undergoing apoptosis would show a green signal. They're looking at this under a confocal microscope, which is good for imaging in thick tissues and seeing colocalization.

The question is asking what the first thing you notice would be. So what do we expect when looking at the embryo after injection?

I remember that in the early embryo, cells are migrating and differentiating. The iPSCs, once injected, should start to integrate into the embryo and differentiate into various cell types. The mRaspberry is under lineage-specific promoters, so each cell type's color would indicate which lineage they're in.

But wait, what about apoptosis? During embryonic development, there's a lot of cell death. For example, in the mouse embryo, around the time of implantation and organogenesis, apoptosis is quite active. So if they're looking for TUNEL (apoptotic cells), they should see some green signals.

But when they inject the iPSCs, which are presumably healthy and viable, why would they undergo apoptosis right away? Or maybe when they start differentiating, they might undergo apoptosis as part of normal development.

Wait, but the first observation after injection... Let's think about the timing. They inject at the 32-cell stage and track over 48 hours, taking samples every 12 hours. So the first observation would be around 12 hours, then 24, 36, 48.

At the 12-hour mark, what's happening? The blastocyst is developing, and the cells are starting to differentiate. So the injected iPSCs would be integrating into the embryo and perhaps beginning to differentiate. But do they start dying quickly?

Or maybe the iPSCs, being pluripotent, are dividing and migrating, but perhaps not undergoing apoptosis yet. Alternatively, the host embryo's own cells might be undergoing apoptosis, but that's not directly related to the injected cells.

Wait, the question is about the iPSCs fate and their co
