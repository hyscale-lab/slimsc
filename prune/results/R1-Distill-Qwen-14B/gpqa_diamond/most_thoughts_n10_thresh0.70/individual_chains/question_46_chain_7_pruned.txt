Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A) 4, B) 8, C) 6, D) 2.

Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs catalyst is specifically a transition metal catalyst, like for ring-closing metathesis or maybe cross metathesis.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me count again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, the compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me see:

Pent is five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on C3. So carbon chain is like:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, is it 3-methylpent-1-ene? So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. The 3-methyl would be the third carbon from the double bond. Let me number. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH-... Then C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 and C5 follow. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternative approach: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Adding a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure becomes CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, but wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-
