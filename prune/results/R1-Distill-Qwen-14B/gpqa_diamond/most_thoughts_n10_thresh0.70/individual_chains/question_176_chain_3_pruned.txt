Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The problem is about measuring observables P and Q in a system and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes.

First, let me read the problem again. The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, no, that's probably a vector. So it's a 3-dimensional vector with components -1, 2, 1. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? Hmm, I should check if this vector is normalized. The norm would be the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, but maybe the problem already gave the normalized state. Or perhaps I should consider it as a non-normalized vector and account for that later.

Then there are two operators, P and Q, given as matrices. The operator P's matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And operator Q's matrix is diagonal:

First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question asks: If someone measures Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q? Wait, no—wait, the order is the other way around. It says measuring Q just after P, so the measurements are first P, then Q. Or is it the other way? Let me read again. "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P"—so the sequence is measure P first, then Q. So the first measurement is P, then Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the order matters because after the first measurement, the state collapses, which affects the second measurement. So I need to find the state after measuring P and then the probability of measuring -1 in Q on that new state.

Wait, but the problem says the probability of
