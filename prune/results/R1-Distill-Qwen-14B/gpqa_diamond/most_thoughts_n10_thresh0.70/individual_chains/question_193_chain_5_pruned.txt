Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the power of 5. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, with different exponents of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So like, plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, no, wait. Parallax is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is d = 1/plx. Right, because the parallax formula is d = 1/plx. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But we want to relate this to distance. Since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. So substituting this into the equation for N gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5. So 1/(plx^5) becomes 1/( (1/d)^5 ) which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Oh, wait, that's interesting.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, I think it's asking about the number of stars per unit distance (like, density). Or is it about the total number in a range of distances? Hmm.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem states, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit range. So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance interval, like a differential change.

Wait, but N is proportional to d^5. So if I think of N as a function of distance, N(d) = k * d^5, where k is some constant. But when considering how many stars are present as you go from distance r to r + dr, it's the differential number dN. So dN/dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, no, N is the total number up to distance r. Because the number of stars within a certain distance could be cumulative. So maybe N is the cumulative number up to distance r, which is proportional to r^5. Then, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r. So dN/dr = 5r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N is proportional to the volume of space within a certain distance, but that's when the number density is uniform. Wait, but this might not be the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused
