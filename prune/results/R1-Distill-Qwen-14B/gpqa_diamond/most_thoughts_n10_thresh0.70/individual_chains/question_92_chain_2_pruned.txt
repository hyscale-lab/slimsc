Okay, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit of a mouthful. So, I guess I need to figure out the structure and then determine how many bonds are formed and broken when this compound is formed from its elements.

Wait, enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Oh right, and it's usually calculated using bond energies. So the approach is to calculate the total energy used to break all the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds form in the products.

But wait, the problem gives me the bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. Oh, and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element and turn it into atoms. For carbon, which is in graphite or another standard state, it's 1000 kJ/mol to atomize it.

So, for the formation enthalpy, I probably need to consider each element’s atoms, calculate the bonds broken in the reactants (like the elements as they are), and then subtract the bonds formed in the product molecule.

Wait, no. Wait, the formation enthalpy is calculated using the bond energies. The formula is: ΔH_f° = [sum of bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds]. Oh, no, wait, is it the other way around? Because if you're forming bonds, that's exothermic, so the product bonds are subtracted.

Wait, no, the correct formula is enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the reactants minus the sum of bond energies in the products. Or is it the reverse? Wait, I might get confused.

Wait, bond energies are energies required to break bonds. So when you form bonds, you release energy. So the enthalpy of formation would be the
