Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So, the system has three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right, so I need to consider all possible configurations of the spins and calculate the energy for each, then sum the exponentials.

Each spin can be +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Manually listing them might help, but maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can group the states based on their energies.

Let me think about the possible values of the energy term. The energy E is proportional to the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Since each S is ±1, each product S_i S_j is ±1. So each term contributes either +1 or -1.

Wait, the sum inside the brackets can be any integer from -3 to +3, depending on how many pairs are aligned versus anti-aligned. Oh wait wait, each S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same and -1 if different. So the sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) can vary.

But E is -J multiplied by that sum. So E = -J * (sum). So, when sum is positive, E is negative, which is lower energy. Since J is probably positive (ferromagnetic coupling), but I don't know, but the problem doesn't specify. But for now, I'll proceed.

Let me find the possible values of (sum). For three spins, the number of +1 and -1 in the products depends on how the spins are arranged.

Wait, another approach: for each possible state (each possible combination of S1, S2, S3), calculate the value of the sum, then compute E, then sum exp(-β E) for all states.

So there are 8 states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
