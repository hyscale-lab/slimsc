Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, hold on. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, and they must be normalized. So the first thing I should check is whether this state vector is normalized. To do that, I need to calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component and see if it equals 1.

So the vector is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute each component squared:
(-1)^2 = 1,
2^2 =4,
1^2=1.
Adding them together: 1 +4 +1 =6. Hmm, that's 6, not 1. So the vector isn't normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, state vectors must have a norm of 1. So I think I need to normalize it before proceeding.

To normalize it, I have to divide each component by the square root of the sum. So the normalization factor is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector would be:

(-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Wait, the question just gives the state as (-1,2,1). Does that mean that I need to normalize it before using it for calculations? Probably, because otherwise, the probabilities might not add up to 1.

But wait, the problem statement says it's a column matrix, but doesn't mention whether it's normalized. Hmm, maybe I should proceed by assuming that the given vector is the actual state vector, but it's not normalized. So in any case, I'll use it as is, but perhaps when I compute the probabilities, I need to normalize it first. Alternatively, perhaps it's already given as a normalized vector, but that doesn't seem to be the case here because (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2=6. So definitely not normalized.

Wait, but maybe the problem is written in a way that the vector is already normalized, but I might have miscalculated. Let me double-check: (-1)^2 is 1,
