Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let me read the question again.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. Their orbits are circular, and they were discovered using the TTV method. I remember TTV stands for transit timing variations, which is a method used to detect planets by looking at the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here; maybe the method just tells us about their existence.

The problem gives me the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, the temperature ratio T1/T2 is 1.4, and T2/T3 is 2.3. Let me write that down:

T1/T2 = 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 * T2

T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3

So, T3 is about 0.4348 times T2.

Also, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35.

M1/M2 = 1.15 → M1 = 1.15 * M2

M2/M3 = 1.35 → M3 = M2 / 1.35 ≈ 0.7407 * M2

So, M3 is about 0.74 times M2.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Specifically, by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo is the measure of how much light that hits a planet is reflected. So, since it's the same for all, that shouldn't affect the calculation in a way that complicates things.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming radiation from its star and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [(L/(16πσ))*( (1 - a) ) / (a_orb^2)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the orbital distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But since all three planets are orbiting the same star, the L would be the same for each planet. So, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the albedo. But in this problem, the albedos are all the same, so the temperature ratio can be used to find the ratio of their orbital distances.

Let me write the formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming a circular orbit and ignoring greenhouse effects, etc. because it's the equilibrium temperature):

T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ a_orb^2) ) ]^(1/4)

But since all have the same a (albedo=0.3), and same L, the T should be inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. So, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a_orb).

Wait, let me think again. If T is proportional to [ (1 - a) / a_orb² ]^(1/4 ), then:

T ∝ (1/a_orb² )^(1/4 ) = 1/(a_orb)^(0.5) → T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a_orb)

So, higher T means closer to the star. So, the ratio of temperatures can give the ratio of the inverse square roots of their orbital distances.

So, T1 / T2 = (sqrt(a2 / a1)) ) → because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1)

Wait, no, let's correct that:

If T1 = [ (1 - a)/(a1^2) ]^(1/4) * C, where C is a constant, then:

T1 / T2 = ( (1 - a)/(a1^2) )^(1/4) / ( (1 - a)/(a2^2) )^(1/4) )

Since (1 - a) is the same for all, it cancels out. So,

T1/T2 = [ (a2^2) / (a1^2) ) ]^(1/4 ) = (a2/a1)^(1/2) ) → (a2/a1)^(1/2) = T1/T2.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1 )

Wait, so let me rearrange that.

T1 = T2 * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So, if T1 is larger than T2, that would imply that a2 is larger than a1. Because if the planet is farther out, it's colder. Wait, but if a2 is larger, then 1/sqrt(a2) is smaller, so T would be lower. Hmm, maybe I should think about it again.

Wait, let me actually write the formula:

T1 = T_eq = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ a1^2) ]^(1/4 )

T2 = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ a2^2) ]^(1/4 )

Taking the ratio T1/T2:

= [ (a2^2 / a1^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

= (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, wait. So, if a2 > a1, then sqrt(a2/a1) >1, so T1 > T2.

Wait, that can't be right because being farther out (a2 >a1) would make the planet colder, so T2 should be less than T1. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me correct. Let's think about the formula again.

The equilibrium temperature equation is given by:

T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d^2) ]^(1/4 )

where d is the distance from the star (orbital radius). So, T is proportional to (1/d^2 )^(1/4 ) = 1/d^(0.5) → T = k / sqrt(d), where k is a constant.

So, T ∝ 1/ sqrt(d )

So, if planet 1 is at distance d1, planet 2 at d2, then:

T1 = k / sqrt(d1 )

T2 = k / sqrt(d2 )

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

Because (k/sqrt(d1 )) / (k/sqrt(d2 )) ) = sqrt( d2 ) / sqrt( d1 ) ) = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

Thus, T1/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

So, if T1 is larger than T2, then d2 must be larger than d1. Because sqrt(d2/d1) >1 → d2/d1 >1 → d2 >d1.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if planet 1 has a higher temperature than planet 2, planet 2 must be farther away. Because being farther from the star reduces the temperature.

So, let's apply that to the given data.

Given: T1/T2 ≈1.4 → so sqrt( d2/d1 ) = 1.4 → d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → d2 = 1.96 * d1.

So, Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3 → so sqrt( d3 / d2 ) = T2/T3 → 2.3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

Wait, let me check:

T2 = k / sqrt(d2 )

T3 = k / sqrt(d3 )

So, T2 / T3 = (k/sqrt(d2 )) / (k/sqrt(d3 )) ) = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

So, T2/T3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

Given T2/T3 =2.3 → sqrt( d3/d2 ) =2.3 → d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 =5.29 → d3=5.29 * d2.

Now, since d2 =1.96 *d1, then d3=5.29*1.96*d1 = let's compute that.

5.29 *1.96 → Let me compute 5 *1.96=9.8, 0.29*1.96≈0.5684 → total ≈10.3684.

So, d3= ~10.3684 *d1.

So, the orbital distance for Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

But the question is about the orbital period. Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (orbital radius) divided by the mass of the star. But wait, in reality, the exact form is:

P^2 = (4π²/(G(M + m))) * a^3

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass, we can approximate M + m ≈ M (the mass of the star). So,

P² ∝ a³ / M

But wait, looking at the problem, we are given the masses of the planets, M1, M2, M3, but not the mass of the star. Hmm. So, perhaps I need to think about another approach.

Wait, the problem gives the masses of the planets, but I don't have the star's mass. So, perhaps the star's mass is the same for all planets, so it's a factor that can be canceled out when taking ratios. Let me think.

The orbital period P depends on the mass of the star and the orbital radius. The formula is:

P² = (4π² * a³) / (G(M_star + M_planet))

But since the planet masses are much smaller, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So, the period is:

P ≈ ( (4 π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

So, P ∝ a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_star )

But in this problem, the star's mass is the same for all three planets. So, if we take the ratio of periods of Planet3 to Planet1, the M_star will cancel out.

So,

P3 / P1 = (a3^3 / a1^3 )^(1/2 )

Because P ∝ a^(3/2 )

Wait, let me write it properly.

P3 = ( (4 π² a3^3) / (G M_star) )^(1/2 )

Similarly,

P1 = ( (4 π² a1^3 ) / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

So,

P3 / P1 = [ (a3^3 ) / (a1^3 ) ]^(1/2 ) = (a3/a1 )^(3/2 )

But from earlier calculation, a3 is about 10.37 * a1.

So,

P3/P1 = (10.37 )^(3/2 )

Wait, 10.37 to the power of 3/2.

Let me compute that.

First, sqrt(10.37) is approximately sqrt(10) is 3.162, sqrt(10.24)=3.2 (since 3.2^2=10.24). 10.37 is a bit more, so let's compute sqrt(10.37):

3.2^2 =10.24 → 10.37 is 0.13 above that.

So, the square root of 10.37 ≈ 3.2 + (0.13)/(2*3.2) ) → 3.2 + 0.13/(6.4) ≈ 3.2 + 0.0203 ≈ 3.2203.

So, sqrt(10.37) ≈3.2203.

Then, (10.37)^(3/2) = (sqrt(10.37))^3 = (3.2203)^3.

Let's compute 3.2^3 =32.768.

But 3.2203 is a bit more than 3.2. Let me compute 3.22^3.

3.22 *3.22 = ?

3.22 *3.22 → (3.2 *3.2 ) + (0.02*3.2*2) + (0.02^2)

Wait, 3.2 *3.2 =10.24

0.02 *3.2 *2 =0.128

0.02^2=0.0004 → So, 10.24 +0.128=10.368 +0.0004=10.3684.

So, (3.22)^2 =10.3684.

Then, 3.22 * 10.3684 → let's compute:

10.3684 *3 =31.1052

10.3684 *0.22 =2.280.

Adding together: 31.1052 + 2.280 =33.3852.

So, 3.22^3 ≈33.3852.

So, (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ 33.385.

So, P3/P1≈33.385 → approximately 33.4.

Wait, but wait a second. The options given are:

A) ~ 10.4

B) ~ 3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So, option D is 33.4, which would match this.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation steps because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, earlier I found that d3 = a3 =10.37 *a1.

So, a3/a1 =10.37.

Then, P3/P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2 ) = (10.37 )^(1.5 )

Which is what I computed as about 33.4.

But let me make sure all the steps are correct.

Wait, another approach: Since the equilibrium temperature ratio gives the distance ratio, and then Kepler's law relates the period to the distance.

So, the steps are:

1. Find the ratio of the distances a3/a1.

From T ratios:

T1/T2 =1.4 → sqrt( d2/d1 )=1.4 → d2=1.96 d1.

T2/T3=2.3 → sqrt( d3/d2 )=2.3 → d3=5.29 d2.

So, d3=5.29 *1.96 d1 = (5.29 *1.96) d1.

Calculating 5.29 *1.96:

5 *1.96=9.8, 0.29*1.96=0.5684. Total=10.3684.

So, d3=10.3684 d1.

Then, Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ / M_star.

So, P3² / P1² = (a3³ / a1³ ) → (a3/a1 )^3.

So, (P3/P1 )^2 = (10.3684 )^3 → P3/P1 = sqrt( (10.3684 )^3 )

Compute (10.3684 )^3:

10.3684^3 = (10 + 0.3684 )^3.

But perhaps I can approximate it as 10.3684^3 ≈ (10.37 )^3.

But 10.37^3 = (10 +0.37 )^3 = 10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.37 + 3*(10)*(0.37)^2 + (0.37)^3.

= 1000 + 3*100*0.37 + 3*10*(0.1369) + 0.050653.

=1000 + 111 + 4.107 + 0.050653 → 1000 + 111=1111, +4.107=1115.107, +0.05=1115.157.

So, (10.37)^3≈1115.16.

So, (P3/P1 )^2 =1115.16 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1115.16 )

What's sqrt(1115.16 )?

Well, 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156. So, 33^2=1089, 33.4^2= (33 +0.4 )^2=33^2 + 2*33*0.4 +0.4^2=1089 +26.4 +0.16=1115.56.

Wait, 33.4^2 =1115.56.

But our value is 1115.16, which is just a bit less than that.

So, sqrt(1115.16 ) is just a bit less than 33.4.

So, 33.4^2= 1115.56 → 1115.56 -1115.16=0.4 → so, 33.4^2 is 0.4 higher than our target.

So, let's compute how much less than 33.4 is needed.

Let x = 33.4 - delta.

We have (33.4 - delta)^2 =1115.16 → approximately.

Expanding (33.4 - delta)^2 ≈33.4^2 - 2*33.4 * delta + delta^2.

We can ignore delta^2 since delta is small.

So, 1115.56 - 66.8 delta ≈ 1115.16 → 66.8 delta ≈0.4 → delta ≈0.4 /66.8 ≈0.00599.

So, delta ≈0.006.

So, 33.4 - 0.006≈33.394.

So, sqrt(1115.16 )≈33.394.

So, P3/P1≈33.394, which is approximately 33.4. So, option D is ~33.4.

But wait, the mass of the star is the same for all planets, so when I applied Kepler's law, I used M_star as the same for both, and it cancels out. So, that's correct.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in applying Kepler's law. Let me double-check.

Kepler's third law can be written as:

P² = (4 π² G M_star )^{-1} * a^3

So, P² ∝ a^3 / M_star.

Therefore, when you take P3/P1, it's sqrt( (a3³)/(a1³) ) * sqrt( M_star / M_star ) → so the M_star cancels, so our calculation holds.

Another thing to think about: the mass of the planets. The problem gives the masses of the planets as M1, M2, M3. But in Kepler's law, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So, the mass of the planet doesn't affect the period much. So, our calculation is correct in not considering planet masses.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the mass ratios between the planets, but not the star. So, perhaps the star's mass is the same for all planets, so M_star is the same in all cases.

So, the period only depends on a and M_star.

Therefore, our approach is correct.

So, the answer should be D) ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply the relationships between equilibrium temperature, orbital distance, and Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Relating Temperature Ratios to Orbital Distances
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance:
\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]
Given the temperature ratios:
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)

We can write:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_2 = a_1 \cdot (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \cdot a_1
\]
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_3 = a_2 \cdot (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \cdot a_2
\]

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 \cdot a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 \cdot a_2 \):
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \cdot a_1 = 10.3684 \cdot a_1
\]

Thus, the orbital distance of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.37 \times \) that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Applying Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states:
\[
P^2 \propto a^3
\]
Taking the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]
Substituting \( a_3 / a_1 = 10.37 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( (10.37)^{3/2} \)
First, compute \( \sqrt{10.37} \):
\[
\sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22
\]
Then, cube the result:
\[
(3.22)^3 \approx 33.4
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \( 33.4 \times \) that of Planet1.

### Final Answer
The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately **33.4**.

Answer: D
