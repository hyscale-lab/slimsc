Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a conducting sphere. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given, so I can check against them once I figure out the solution.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, charges can move on its surface. But wait, since it's a conductor, the charges will reside on the surface. Also, the sphere being grounded means that any induced charges can leave the sphere, right? Or wait, no—grounding allows the sphere to maintain neutral by providing a path for charges to go in or out. So, when we have an external charge, the conductor's charges might rearrange but since it's grounded, it will remain neutral overall.

Wait, no. If the charge q is outside, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the sphere's inner surface has an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have some induced charge. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can flow to the ground. Oh, wait, but the initial sphere is neutral? The problem says it's a grounded conducting sphere, but it doesn't say if it's initially charged. I think the sphere is neutral to start with because it's just grounded and the problem doesn't mention any initial charge.

So, when I place a charge q outside, the induced charges on the sphere's inner surface must be -q, to mimic the effect of a capacitor. But wait, wait, no. Because the sphere is a conductor, the charges on the inner surface are induced to be opposite to the external charge. So the inner surface would have a charge of -q. But then, the outer surface must have a charge to balance. But since the sphere is neutral, the outer surface must have +q? Because the total charge on the sphere is zero? Let me think again.

The conducting sphere is initially neutral. When we bring a charge q close, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q (because the charge q induces opposite charges on the inner surface). Since the sphere is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. But wait, the sphere is grounded. So any excess charge on the outer surface would go to the ground. Oh wait, no. Because the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges on the outer surface would actually leave the sphere, right? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. When a conductor is grounded, it means that any excess charge can flow to the Earth. So, for a conducting sphere that's neutral, when you place a charge q near it, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have a charge +q. But because the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface would flow into the ground, leaving the sphere with no net charge. So, in this case, the sphere's inner surface is -q, but the outer surface is zero because it's grounded. Wait, that makes sense because the sphere was initially neutral.

Wait no, no. Wait, the initial sphere is neutral. So, when you bring a charge q near, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q. Then, the outer surface will have a charge of +q (because the sphere's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer must be +q). But since the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface can flow to the ground, leaving the sphere with no net charge. So, the sphere's net charge after grounding is zero, but the inner surface has -q and the outer surface has 0. So, the induced charge on the sphere is -q on the inside and +q on the outside, but the +q leaves, so the sphere remains neutral.

Wait, but that's confusing. So, the sphere's total charge is zero. So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance. But if the outer surface can conduct, then that +q would go to ground. So the sphere ends up with inner surface -q and outer surface 0, but that's only possible if the outer surface is +q and then it's conducted away.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of image charges. For a conducting sphere, when you place a charge q outside, the conducting sphere can be considered as having an image charge at the center. The method of images says that the potential inside the conductor is constant, so the image charge would be such that the potential due to the external charge and the image charge is the same as the conductor's potential.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this differently. The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q into the vicinity of the sphere. Alternatively, it's the sum of the potential energies of each part.

Wait, the system consists of the charge q and the conducting sphere. The potential energy would be the work done in assembling these charges. But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps some of the charges are at zero potential.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the system as two parts: the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. The potential energy would be the energy stored in the system due to the interaction between q and the induced charges, plus any energy in the induced charges themselves.

But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges on the outer surface (if any) are at zero potential, so the potential energy of those charges would be zero. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, let's think about the potential at the surface of the sphere. Since it's grounded, its potential is zero. So any charges on the outer surface are at zero potential, meaning no potential energy. So, the only potential energy comes from the charge q and the induced charges on the inner surface.

So, the induced charge on the inner surface is -q. So, the potential energy between q and this induced charge.

Wait, but the induced charge is part of the sphere. So, the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a point distance d from the center of the sphere. But the sphere is conducting, so it's like a spherical capacitor.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's potential energy is the same as the energy stored in the capacitor formed by the charge q and the sphere.

Wait, the setup is similar to a point charge and a conducting sphere. The potential energy can be found by considering the charge q and the induced charges.

Wait, another approach: the potential at the location of the charge q due to the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, its potential is zero. The charge q creates an electric field, which induces a charge on the sphere.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should recall the formula for the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere.

I remember that the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a point d away. But because the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential at infinity is the same as the sphere's surface (since it's grounded, V=0). So, the potential energy is the work done against the electric field.

Wait, but another way: the potential energy U is equal to the charge times the potential at its location. But the potential at the location of q is due to all sources, including the sphere.

But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. So the potential at q's position is just the potential due to q itself and any other sources. Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, the charge on the sphere can't create a potential difference because it's at ground level.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done by bringing q to that point, considering the induced charges.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy U of the system is the sum of the potential energies of the individual charges. So, the potential energy due to the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere.

But wait, the sphere is neutral overall, so the sum of the induced charges is zero. The inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q, but since the sphere is grounded, the outer +q flows away, leaving the sphere with inner -q and outer 0. So, the sphere's net charge is zero, but there's an induced charge of -q on the inner surface.

So, the potential energy would be the interaction between the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere. Since the sphere's inner surface has -q, the potential energy U is equal to the work done to bring charge q from infinity to distance d, considering the potential due to the induced -q.

Wait, but the induced -q is part of the sphere. So, the potential energy can be thought of as the work done by bringing the charge q into the field of the induced charge on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a point charge and a spherical shell with induced charges.

Wait, the induced charge on the sphere is -q, located at the center. So, the sphere acts as a conductor, so the induced charge is at the center. So, the potential due to the sphere's induced charge at the location of q (distance d from center) is the same as if the -q were at the center.

So, the potential at the location of q is due to this image charge -q. The potential V at that point is V = k(-q)/d. But wait, potential energy U is q times the potential at that point. Wait no, the potential energy of a charge in a potential is U = q * V, where V is the potential at the location of the charge due to other charges.

Wait, in this case, the sphere's induced charge is -q. So, the potential at the location of q (distance d) is V = k*(-q)/d. So, the potential energy U is (q) * V. So, U = q * ( -k q / d ) = -k q² / d.

But wait, none of the options match that. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some factor.

Wait, maybe I should consider the energy stored in the system. The charge q and the induced charge -q on the sphere. The potential energy is then the work done to bring the charge q into the potential field of the induced charge, which is -q/(4πε₀ d) * q. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of capacitance.

The capacitance of a point charge near a sphere can be thought of as a spherical capacitor. Wait, no, the setup is a point charge outside a conducting sphere. The capacitance of a sphere is usually C = 4πε₀ R, but in this case, the sphere is connected to ground.

Wait, perhaps the sphere and the charge form a capacitor. The charge on the sphere is -q (on the inner surface), but when the sphere is grounded, the outer surface charge leaves, so the only induced charge is -q on the inner surface, right?

So, the sphere's inner surface is -q, and the charge q is outside. The potential energy between them would be the energy stored in the capacitor formed between the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere's induced charge is -q, so the system has charge +q and -q separated by some distance.

Wait, maybe the capacitance approach would work. The capacitance C between the charge q and the sphere is C = (4πε₀) * (d)/(d - R), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the capacitance is C = (4πε₀) * (d) / (d + R), but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy can be found using the formula U = (1/2) * q * V, where V is the potential at the point where q is placed due to the sphere.

Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. The potential at the location of q is due to the induced charge on the sphere. The induced charge is -q at the center, so the potential at d would be V = k*(-q)/d.

Wait, but then U would be (1/2) * q * V, because when you bring the charge q from infinity, the work done is against the potential. Hmm, no, maybe the correct formula is U = q * V, where V is the potential at the point due to all sources except q.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it step by step.

1. The conducting sphere is initially neutral and grounded, so any induced charges on the outer surface can flow to ground.

2. When a charge q is placed at a distance d from the sphere's center, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q. But since the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface flows to the ground, leaving the sphere with inner surface -q and outer surface 0. So, the net charge on the sphere is zero.

3. The induced charge on the inner surface is -q, which can be considered as a point charge at the center of the sphere.

4. The potential at the location of q (distance d from center) due to the induced charge is V = k*(-q)/d.

5. The potential energy U of the system is then the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to that point. But since the sphere is conducting, the potential at the sphere's surface is zero (because it's grounded). So, the potential energy is the charge multiplied by the potential at that point.

Wait, but q is the charge being moved. The potential at its position is V = (k*(-q))/d. So, the potential energy U = q * V = q * ( -k q / d ) = -k q² / d.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: U=−(1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²)
Option B: U=−k q² d/(d² − R²)
Option C: U=−(1/2) k q² R²/(d² − R²)
Option D: U=− (1/2) *k q² R/(d² − R²)

Hmm, my initial thought gave U = -k q² /d, which doesn't match any. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the induced charge is -q on the sphere's inner surface, and the potential energy is the work done to bring that induced charge onto the sphere. Because the sphere is conducting, the induced charge is at R distance from q.

Wait, no, the induced charge is at the center of the sphere. So, bringing a charge -q to the center from infinity would involve moving it in the field of q. The work done would be the integral of F·dl from infinity to the center.

The electric field at the center due to q is E = k q / d², directed towards the charge (since q is positive, the field points towards the sphere). Wait, but if q is positive, the induced charge on the sphere's inner surface is -q, so the field at the center due to the external charge is E = k q / d² radially outward? Or inward? Let me think: the external charge is positive, so the electric field it produces at the sphere's center is directed towards the charge, which is at distance d. So, E = k q / d² pointing towards q.

Wait, but how does this affect the work done in moving the induced charge? Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the potential energy as the energy stored in the system, which would be the same as the potential energy of a point charge and its image charge in a spherical conductor.

Wait, I recall that for a point charge q outside a conducting sphere, the image charge method says that the sphere can be replaced by a charge -q at the center. So, the system would have two charges: +q at distance d from the sphere's center, and -q at the center.

The potential energy between them is U = (1/4πε₀) * (q * (-q)) / (d - R') where R' is the distance between them. Wait, but in this case, the image charge is at the center, so the distance is d - 0 = d. So, U = - (k q²) / d. But again, none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that the image charge method accounts for the energy in the system as the sum of the energies between the original charge and image charge, but also considering the work done in assembling the induced charges.

Another thought: when you bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's induced charge is -q. The work done in assembling this induced charge on the sphere would also contribute to the potential energy.

Wait, the energy stored in the capacitor formed by the charge q and the sphere. The capacitance C between the charge q (treated as a point charge) and the sphere (radius R) would be C = 4πε₀ ( (d) / (d - R) )? Or maybe it's 4πε₀ ( (d) / (d + R) )? Hmm, I'm not sure.

The formula for capacitance when a point charge is near a sphere is something I need to recall. Alternatively, maybe the capacitance is C = (4πε₀) * (d) / (d - R), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think of the sphere as a conductor. The potential on the sphere's surface is zero (grounded). The charge induced on the inner surface is -q, so the potential at the center is V = k (-q) / R. But the sphere is conducting, so the potential is the same throughout the conductor. Wait, but the sphere's surface is at zero potential, so the potential inside must be zero as well? No, that can't be right because the charge is external.

Wait, perhaps the potential at the center is the same as the potential on the sphere's surface, which is zero because it's grounded. So, the potential on the sphere is zero. Then, the potential at the point where q is located is due to the induced charge. So, V = k (-q) / d. 

Then, the potential energy U is the work done to bring charge q from infinity to that point, which would be U = q * V = q * ( -k q / d ) = -k q² / d.

But this doesn't match any of the options. So, perhaps I'm missing something in this approach.

Another angle: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So, the original charge q, the induced charge -q on the sphere's inner surface, and any other charges. But since the sphere is neutral, the outer surface has no charge, so the only other charge is -q on the inner surface.

So, the potential energy is the energy between q and the induced -q. The distance between them is d (since the sphere's radius is R, but the charge q is at distance d from the center, so the distance between q and the induced charge is d - 0 = d).

Wait, the induced charge is at the center, so the distance between q and the induced charge is d.

So, the potential energy U is the electrostatic potential energy between two charges, which is U = (k q (-q)) / d = -k q² / d.

Again, not matching any options. So, perhaps the problem is more complex than I thought.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the sphere has a self-capacitance, and the potential energy is due to the charge placed on the sphere and the external charge.

The sphere's self-capacitance C is 4πε₀ R. So, when a charge q' is induced on the sphere, the potential on the sphere would be V = q' / C. But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. So, any charge on the sphere must be zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the sphere is neutral, and when q is placed near, the sphere's inner surface has -q, but the outer surface has +q, which flows to ground. So, the sphere remains neutral, but the inner surface has -q.

But the self-capacitance is for the sphere itself. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: The potential energy stored in the system when a charge q is placed near the sphere is equal to the work done in assembling the charge and the induced charges.

The induced charge on the sphere is -q at a distance R from the charge q. So, the potential energy would be the energy to bring the charge q from infinity to d, and the energy to bring the induced -q from infinity to R.

Wait, but the induced charge isn't actually moved; it's induced by the presence of q. So perhaps the energy is only the interaction between q and the induced charge.

Alternatively, the potential energy is given by the formula U = (1/2) * q * V, where V is the potential at the location of q due to the sphere.

But the sphere's potential is zero, so that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the same as the energy stored in the capacitor formed by the charge q and the sphere. The capacitance C between the point charge and the sphere can be calculated, and then the energy is (1/2) C V², but since V is the potential on the sphere due to q, which is zero because it's grounded, that would imply zero energy, which can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. So, bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, and bringing the induced -q from infinity to the sphere's surface.

Wait, but the induced charges are part of the sphere, so bringing them doesn't require additional work beyond the work done by the external charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy of the system, which includes the charge q and the induced charge -q. The energy would be U = (1/2) * (k q (-q)) / d = - (k q²) / (2 d).

Wait, that would give U = - (k q²) / (2 d), which matches option A if d^2 + R^2 is in the denominator. Wait, no. Let's look at the options again.

Option A is U=−(1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²). If my calculation is U=−k q²/(2 d), that would require d/(d² + R²) =1/(2 d), which would imply that d² + R² = 2 d, which isn't generally the case. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption about the induced charge being -q is incorrect. Maybe the induced charge is a function of the distance d and radius R.

Wait, another approach: the method of images. For a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge of a point charge q at distance d from the center would be located at a distance (R²/d) from the center, but on the same side as q. So, the image charge q' is given by q' = - q (R/d). Wait, no, I think the image charge is q' = - q (R²/d²) ?

Wait, I'm not recalling the exact formula. Let me think: the image charge method for a sphere. The image charge q' is located at a distance r' from the center, where r' = R² / d. The charge is q' = - q (R / d).

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it. The potential at the sphere's surface must be zero because it's grounded. So, the potential due to q and the image charge q' at the sphere's surface (radius R) must be zero.

So, the potential at a point on the sphere due to q and q' is zero. The distance from q to a point on the sphere is sqrt(d² + R² - 2 d R cosθ), but that's complicated. Alternatively, using the image charge method, the image charge q' is placed such that the potential on the sphere is zero.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the image charge location and value. The image charge q' is located at distance r' from the center, along the line connecting the center to q. The condition is that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential at any point on the sphere's surface due to q and q' must be zero.

Assume the image charge q' is at a distance r' from the center on the same side as q. The potential at a point on the sphere's surface (distance R from center) would be the sum of potentials from q and q'.

So, V = k q / (distance from q to surface point) + k q' / (distance from q' to surface point) = 0.

The distance from q to the surface point is sqrt(d² + R² - 2 d R cosθ), which complicates things. But for the image charge method, the image charge should be such that the potential on the sphere is zero. So, the image charge is chosen such that the potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge is located at a distance r' such that r' = R² / d. So, if q is at distance d, the image charge is at R²/d. The charge magnitude is q' = - (q R) / d.

So, the image charge q' is - (q R)/d, located at R²/d from the center.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the potential energy between q and q'. So,

U = (1/4πε₀) * (q * q') / (distance between them).

The distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (k) * q * (- q R/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify:

U = -k q² R / d * (d/(d² - R²)) )

The d's cancel:

U = -k q² R / (d² - R²)

Wait, option D is U=− (1/2) *k q² R/(d² − R²). So, not matching that. Hmm.

But wait, I have an extra factor of 1/2 somewhere? Because when calculating the potential energy between two charges, sometimes you take 1/2 to avoid double-counting. But in this case, we're considering two charges: the original q and the image charge. So, perhaps the correct formula is U = (1/2) * (k q q') / r, where r is the separation between them.

So, in that case,

U = (1/2) * [ k q (- q R/d) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify:

= (1/2) * [ -k q² R / d ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ]

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) * (-k q² R) / (d² - R² )

Which gives:

U = - (1/2) k q² R / (d² - R² )

Looking at the options, option D is U = - (1/2) k q² R / (d² - R²). So that matches.

So, the correct answer is option D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we analyze the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is initially neutral and grounded, meaning its total charge remains zero, but charges redistribute on its surface due to the external charge \( q \). 

When \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere, the induced charge on the inner surface of the sphere is \( -q \), and the outer surface remains neutral (since the sphere is grounded). The induced charge \( -q \) on the inner surface can be treated as if it were located at the center of the sphere for the purpose of calculating the potential energy.

The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the electrostatic potential energy between the charge \( q \) and the induced charge \( -q \). The distance between \( q \) and the induced charge is \( d \). The formula for the potential energy between two charges is:

\[
U = \frac{k q (-q)}{d} = -\frac{k q^2}{d}.
\]

However, this result does not match any of the given options. To resolve this, we consider the method of images for a grounded conducting sphere. The image charge \( q' \) of the external charge \( q \) is located at a distance \( r' = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere, and its magnitude is \( q' = -\frac{q R}{d} \). The potential energy of the system is then the energy between the external charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \), which are separated by a distance \( d - r' = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \).

The potential energy is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q q'}{\text{distance between } q \text{ and } q'}.
\]

Substituting \( q' = -\frac{q R}{d} \) and the separation \( \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \), we get:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q \left(-\frac{q R}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{-k q^2 R}{d} \cdot \frac{d}{d^2 - R^2} = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**. Therefore, the net potential energy of the system is:

\[
U = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
\]

Answer: D
