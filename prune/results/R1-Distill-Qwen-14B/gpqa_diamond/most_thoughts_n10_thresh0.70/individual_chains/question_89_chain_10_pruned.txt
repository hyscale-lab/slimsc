Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step and see what's happening.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane to 240°C with excess KOH gives a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has specific peaks, and there's an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, especially in such conditions, elimination might occur. Wait, but adamantane's structure is pretty rigid. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane-like rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure.

When KOH is used, perhaps it's an E2 elimination. But wait, the product is a solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That peak is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So maybe elimination isn't the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but since it's KOH, which is a strong base, perhaps it's more likely elimination.

Wait, but if it's elimination, we'd get an alkene. But why the IR shows a carbonyl? Oh, wait... wait, perhaps the reaction is elimination to form an epoxide? No, epoxide formation usually involves peracids or other oxidizing agents. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction of dibromide with KOH could lead to the formation of a ketone via a process called dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the formation of an epoxide but with a different mechanism. Or perhaps the base causes the elimination of HBr twice, leading to the formation of an allene (a conjugated diene). But that might not give a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: The IR peak at 1720
