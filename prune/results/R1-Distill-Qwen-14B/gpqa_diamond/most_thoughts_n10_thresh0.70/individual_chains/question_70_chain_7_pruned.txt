Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's parse the reactions given. 

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C also reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I need to figure out what each of these compounds might be. Let's start with reaction 4 because it might give me some clues. 

Reaction 4: D + B â†’ H (solvent). Solvents are usually polar molecules, maybe something like water, ethanol, or something else that can dissolve many substances. But wait, D and B are gases. Hmm. If B is a gas, maybe it's something like HCl or NH3? Wait, but D is a gas too. Let me think. If B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a common solvent, perhaps H is something like HCl + NH3? Wait, but that would form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Oh, wait, maybe H is something like H2O? No, because B and D would have to be gases that react to form water. Hmm. Maybe H is something else, like ethanol? Or perhaps H is a different compound.

Alternatively, think about common solvents. Maybe H is something like acetone, but that's a liquid, not formed by gases. Wait, perhaps H is NH3 itself? But if B is something that reacts with D to form NH3. Or maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Hmm, not sure yet. Let's move on.

Looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps the reaction is something like the hydrolysis of a salt. Wait, but C is the product of A and B. Maybe A is a metal, B is a non-metal, and C is a compound like a metal chloride?
