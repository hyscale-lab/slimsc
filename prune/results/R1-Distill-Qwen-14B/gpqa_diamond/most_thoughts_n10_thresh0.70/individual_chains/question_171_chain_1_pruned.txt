Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The question is a bit tricky, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The substances given are 1 to 6, each with a benzene ring attached to different groups. The reaction is an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and each forms only one monobromo derivative. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Wait, wait. Electrophilic substitution usually happens where the ring is activated. But bromine is a di-electrophile, right? Oh wait, no, in electrophilic substitution, the bromine acts as an electrophile. So when it's added in excess, the reaction is probably a bromination, adding Br+ as the electrophile.

But wait, bromine itself is a di-electrophile, so maybe it's a ring substitution. Oh, right, when you have a benzene ring undergoing electrophilic substitution with Br2, it's typically under FeBr3 catalysis. So the Br2 acts as an electrophilic source, generating Br+ which attacks the ring.

But wait, the problem says "substances undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction". So each of these compounds is the benzene ring with a substituent. So each substituent will direct the incoming Br+ to either ortho, meta, or para positions.

But wait, each substituent is an activating or deactivating group, and whether
