Okay, so I've just landed this job at a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21 and purify it quickly. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options, A to D. I need to figure out which plasmid to use.

Hmm, I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid needs to have the correct reading frame and appropriate promoters. But wait, the question is about the DNA sequences of the plasmids. So I need to look for the right coding sequence that matches the given amino acids.

Wait, the given sequence is the amino acid sequence of P53. Each plasmid option is a DNA sequence. I need to find which DNA sequence correctly codes for the P53 protein. Since E. coli uses the standard genetic code, I should probably find which plasmid's coding sequence translates to the correct P53 amino acids.

But wait, each plasmid starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So all four are probably in frame. But some might have stop codons before the end, or might not cover the entire sequence.

Wait, the question is about producing the correct protein. So the DNA sequence should be the correct coding sequence for the entire P53 protein.

Alternatively, maybe some of the plasmids have frame shifts or incorrect reading frames. But given that all start with ATG, that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps some plasmids have additional nucleotides that cause early termination.

Wait, but the amino acid sequence is provided, so perhaps I
