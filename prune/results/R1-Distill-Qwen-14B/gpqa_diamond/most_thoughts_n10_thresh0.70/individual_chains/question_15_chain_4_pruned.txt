Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. And the Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius.

Wait, the key here is the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the orbit. Oh right, the formula I think is P = R / a, where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think.

The transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by (R_planet/R_star), but since the planet's radius is much smaller, maybe it's just roughly the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Or wait, the actual formula I think is P = (R_star / a) * (something else). Or maybe more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) because the planet has a small area relative to the star's disk.

Wait, no, another thought. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block, which is (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the probability of the orbital plane being aligned. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_star / a). Because the planet must pass in front of the star's disk, and the cross-section is a circle with radius R_star. The orbital distance is a, so the chance that the orbit is aligned so that the planet's path crosses the star is R_star / (a * sqrt(1 - eÂ²)), but here the orbits are circular, so e=0. So it's R_star/a.

Wait, so the transit probability P is proportional
