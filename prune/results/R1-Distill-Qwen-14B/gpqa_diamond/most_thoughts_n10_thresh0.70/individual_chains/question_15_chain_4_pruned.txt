Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, Planet_1 or Planet_2. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question says both planets have the same mass, which I think is important because if they have the same mass, maybe other factors like their orbital periods and star properties are more critical here.

So, the planets' orbital periods: Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually indicates a closer orbit. Right, because according to Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, so shorter period implies smaller orbit radius.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses? I remember that more massive stars are typically larger, but in this case, maybe Planet_2's host is a subgiant or something, so it's slightly evolved but same radius.

The probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_s / a) * (1 / (1 + m_p / M_s)), but wait, I might be mixing some terms. Or maybe the probability is proportional to (R_s / a), where R_s is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius. Because the probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. If the star is larger relative to the orbit, the planet is more likely to pass in front.

But given that the RV method has already detected these planets, we know their minimum masses. But for transit probability, the mass might not matter as much as the orbital distance. Wait, no—transit probability is more about the alignment. Oh, wait, no, the transit probability is more about the chance that the orbit's plane is aligned with our line of sight. So the probability is about the geometric chance, which is given by (R_s / a), I think. Or maybe (R_s / a) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is roughly (R_star / a), assuming the star's radius and the planet's orbital radius.

Wait, let me think more clearly. The transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a.

So, the main factors here are the star's radius and the planet's orbital radius. The bigger the R_star is relative to a, the higher the probability.

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2. So the probability depends on a, the orbital radius. The planet with a smaller a (closer to the star) would have a higher probability because R_star/a is larger.

So, which planet has a smaller a? Since Planet_1 has a shorter period, and using Kepler's third law, a^3 is proportional to (M_total) * P^2. Wait, Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, P² ≈ (4π²
