Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical particles. The potential well has a length L, and the energy E is given as E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²). So each particle's energy levels should be quantized.

Wait, but these are identical particles, right? And they're spin-1/2, which I think means they're fermions. Oh right, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin.

In a one-D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²)E, where E is the base energy unit provided. So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n.

But since they are fermions, each state can have a maximum of two particles because of the spin. Each state is defined by its quantum number n and spin. So for spin-1/2, each n can have two particles: spin up and spin down.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, wait. Wait, in a one-D box, each energy level E_n can hold a certain number of particles. Since each particle has spin-1/2, each spatial state (n) can have two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, you can have two particles.

So for four particles, I need to assign each to a unique state, considering the maximum of two per n.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. So let's think about how to fill the states.

Each n can have two particles (spin up and down). So the first state, n=1, can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more, and so on.

Wait, but we've only got four particles. So let's see:

n=1: 2 particles (each with spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (same)
That's four particles. So the ground state would have all four in the lowest two energy levels (n=1 and n=2), each with two particles. But wait, the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies
