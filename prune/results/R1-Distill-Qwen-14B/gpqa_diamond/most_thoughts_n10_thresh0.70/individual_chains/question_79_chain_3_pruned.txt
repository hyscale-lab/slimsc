Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me see what I can do. Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem involves an experiment where compound X (which has the formula C11H12O) undergoes a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, both 1H and 13C. The options are four possible compounds, and I have to identify which one is X.

Wait a second, the reaction conditions. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane—that's a crown ether, right? Or more specifically, it's a macrocyclic diamine. Oh wait, actually, it's called DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene), but wait, no, wait. No, DBU is different; I'm a bit confused. Wait, the structure is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So, the numbers are a bit different. Let me think. Oh, right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane has a bridge structure with two 2-carbon bridges and one 2-carbon bridge. So, it's a bicyclic structure, and in the context of reactions, this is often used as a base, I think. It is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, so it's used in various deprotonations or elimination reactions.

So, the reaction conditions are probably an elimination reaction. So, if compound X has an oxygen in it—like an epoxide or an ether—wait, but X's formula is C11H12O. Let me think about possible functional groups. If X is reacting with DBU, which is a base, maybe it's an elimination reaction. So perhaps X is an epoxide that's undergoing some ring-opening, but wait, the product's NMR is given. Hmm, perhaps I should look at the product and work backward.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says
