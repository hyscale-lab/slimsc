Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct based on the IR and NMR data provided.

First, I should probably look at the spectral data to determine what Compound X is. Then, I can think about what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI, which I remember is a type of dehydrohalogenation or maybe a substitution reaction. Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but more commonly, when a compound has a leaving group like a halide, especially in an elimination reaction. Oh wait, no, red phosphorus and HI might be part of a reaction to eliminate a leaving group, perhaps forming an alkene. Or maybe it's a substitution? Not entirely sure yet, but let's break it down step by step.

Looking at the IR data first. The IR shows strong absorption between 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which could indicate O-H stretches (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (amines), but since there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because the O-H would be around 2500-3000 and the C=O at 1720. Alternatively, an ester or ketone, but the broad peak between 3400–2500 might suggest an O-H group. Let me think: carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches, while alcohols have less broad. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Also, there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which might be C=C aromatic stretching. The 1450 cm-1 could be another aromatic ring mode or maybe a carbonyl in a different context, but 1720 is more likely a carboxylic acid.

Now the NMR. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10. But wait, the integration is 1H, and it's broad. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acid protons are typically around 10-12 ppm, broad because they exchange easily. So that's a point in favor of a carboxylic acid.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, like two protons in each ortho position. So maybe a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents, one at each para position?

Next, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These are probably alkyl chain protons. Let's see: 0.9 t (3H) is a terminal methyl group, like a CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm d (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a CH2. The 1.7 (m, 2H) and 2.9 (m, 1H) might be part of a CH group adjacent to something. Maybe an isopropyl or some branching.

Putting this together: the aromatic part is para-substituted, so maybe it's something like para-methyl and another substituent. Wait, but the substituents could be a carbonyl group. So if it's a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid. But wait, the 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. So perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative. But let's think about the structure.

Wait, the NMR also has an aromatic region. Let's consider a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. So, for example, a benzene ring where the substituents are at the 1 and 4 positions. If one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -COOH), and the other is an alkyl chain.

Wait, the NMR shows 8.0 d (2H) and 7.2 d (2H), which suggests two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets. So the benzene ring must have two substituents in the para positions, each with a pair of protons. So that fits with a para-dichlorobenzene-like structure, but here, the substituents are more likely a carbonyl group and an alkyl group.

Wait, but
