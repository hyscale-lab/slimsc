Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry, specifically C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that CnH symmetry means that the molecule has a rotational axis of order n and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, actually, maybe C3H refers to a point group. Oh right, the point groups. Let me think. The point group C3h has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh) that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. So I'm looking for a molecule that fits into the C3h symmetry point group.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo-trifuran compound, and a triphenyleno-trifuran compound. I need to figure out which one of these has C3h symmetry.

Let me think about each option.

First, triisopropyl borate. Its structure is a central boron atom bonded to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a substituent. Wait, the structure is something like B with three CH(CH2CH3)2 groups attached. So, each isopropyl group is a -C(CH2CH3)2CH2- maybe? No, wait, isopropyl is -CH(CH3)2. So each substituent is an isopropyl group. So the molecule should have three identical substituents around the boron. That suggests a trigonal planar arrangement. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a mirror plane? Well, if all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically around the central atom, then it should have a C3 axis. But for C3h symmetry, which also requires a horizontal mirror plane, I'm not sure. Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. So the plane would be the one perpendicular to the C3 axis. For C3h symmetry, the mirror plane is horizontal, meaning it's perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, or is it that the mirror plane is the same as the rotation axis's plane? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about each molecule's symmetry.

Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think. It's a cage compound with a bridge, so its structure has a certain symmetry. Quinuclidine has a structure
