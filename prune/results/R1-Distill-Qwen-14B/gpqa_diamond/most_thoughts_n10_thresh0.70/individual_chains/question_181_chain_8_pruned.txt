Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, particularly the proton-proton chain. The question here is about the pp-III branch stopping, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton cycle. Let me recall. The proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The main one (pp-I) produces a helium-4 nucleus and two positrons, right? Then there's the pp-II branch, which I think produces lithium-7, and the pp-III branch, which I'm a bit fuzzy on. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the production of boron-8, I believe. So, stopping the pp-III branch would mean no more production of boron-8? Because that's a significant source of high-energy neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the proton-proton chain. The main pp-I produces two neutrinos, but wait, no, I think each step produces different neutrinos. Oh wait, no, in the pp-I branch, each proton-proton fusion produces two positrons and two neutrinos, right? Or wait, maybe each reaction produces two neutrinos. But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact details.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei, releasing high-energy neutrinos. Oh, and the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy because of the decay of boron-8, which has a longer lifetime. So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of these high-energy neutrinos would stop.

But the question is about the flux in two specific bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, band 1 is lower energy and band 2 is higher.

I think that most neutrinos from the pp-I process have lower energies, while the pp-III branch contributes to higher energy neutrinos. So, if the pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like those in band 2) will decrease, while the lower energy ones (band 1) are less affected.

Wait, but what's the exact contribution of each branch to the neutrino flux? I remember that the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp
