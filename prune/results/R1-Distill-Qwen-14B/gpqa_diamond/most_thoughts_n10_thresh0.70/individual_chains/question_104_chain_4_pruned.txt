Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as each other, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-like in mass. The planets are in circular orbits, so that probably means their orbits are nice and even without any funny business.

The method used is the Radial Velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift is periodic and tells us about the planet's presence and some of its characteristics.

So, planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Wait, the maximum velocity of the star (v) is given by the formula involving the planet's mass (M_p), the orbital period (P), and the semi-major axis (a), but since the orbits are circular, a is the same as the radius.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the formula I remember is the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p)^2) / (M_star * (1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1/(P * (1 - e^2)^(0.5)) ) ), but wait, that might be more complicated than I need.

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler relation. The RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the star's motion. The formula that connects the semi-amplitude K with the orbital period P is K ‚àù (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3). Wait, or is it that K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )? Because I think K depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period in that way.

Wait, another approach: The RV method measures the star's velocity
