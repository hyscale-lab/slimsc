Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. When a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to wobble, and this wobble shifts the spectral lines slightly. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period or something like that.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both stars are like our Sun, and both planets have about the same mass. They both have circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method - the shift in wavelength (the Doppler shift) is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think is that the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

The formula is K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / (4 * pi^2) ) * (1 / (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(a) )) )? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) ), but perhaps I'm mixing some terms.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (c) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term becomes 1.

But since both stars have the same mass (M_* same for both), and the planets have similar masses (so M_p is same for both), and we can assume that M_p << M_* because Neptune's mass is much smaller than the Sun. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is same for both.

So for both planets, K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) / (M_*)^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let's correct that. Let me recall the exact formula. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/1) * ( (2 pi) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / (c )

Wait, maybe another way. Alternatively, the formula is:

K = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( c ) * (1/( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( c ) * (1/( M_*^(2/3) )) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)
