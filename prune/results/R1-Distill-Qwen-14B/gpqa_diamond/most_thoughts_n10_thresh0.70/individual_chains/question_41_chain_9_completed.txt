Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. In this case, the glass is moving. So I think I need to consider both the refractive index and the motion of the glass.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. When the medium is moving, does the speed of light change? Or is the speed of light always c in vacuum, and when in a medium, it's c/n regardless of the medium's motion?

Oh right, Einstein's theory of relativity says that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But this isn't a vacuum; it's glass. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the rest frame of the glass. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this is a case where I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the glass is moving, we have to transform the velocity of the light from the glass's frame to the lab frame.

Wait, but wait. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v towards the observer in the lab frame.

So in the lab frame, what is the velocity of the light? Let's denote the velocity of light in the glass's frame as u. Then, u = c/n. But since the glass is moving at velocity v, we have to apply the velocity addition formula.

The formula to add velocities in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but wait, is that correct? Or is it (u + v')/(1 + (u v')/c²), where v' is the relative velocity? I think in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, and the light is moving at u = c/n in the glass frame. So to get the lab frame's velocity of the light, we should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. Suppose in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. The glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So the lab frame would see the light's speed as... what?

Using the velocity addition formula: u_lab = (u_glass + v) / (1 + (u_glass * v)/c² )

Wait, but wait. Let's define it properly. Let me set up the frames. The lab is S, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the S frame. The glass's rest frame is S'. In S', the light has velocity u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion (since it's moving towards the observer in the lab, and the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion).

So to find the velocity of the light in the lab frame (u'), we use the velocity transformation from S' to S. The formula is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Wait, no, I think I have the formula backwards. Wait, the standard formula is for when you have a velocity in S' (u') and you want to find it in S. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ). Alternatively, if you have a velocity u in S, then in S' it's [u - v]/(1 - (u v)/c² ). Hmm, I might have that mixed up.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say an object has velocity u in the lab frame (S), and the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The speed of the object in the glass's frame (S') is u'. Using the velocity transformation, u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ). So in our case, in the glass's frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n. We want to find u (the lab frame speed) given u' and v.

So rearranging the formula, u = (u' + v) * [ 1/(1 + (u' v)/c² ) ]

Ah, okay, so that makes sense. So u' is c/n, and v is the speed of the glass in the lab frame. So substituting:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

Denominator becomes 1 + (v)/(n c) )

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator again. The denominator is 1 + (u' v) / c². Substituting u'=c/n, it's 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + (v)/(n c) )

So now, putting it all together:

u = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ] 

Let me factor numerator and denominator. Let's write the denominator as (n c + v) / (n c) )

Wait, 1 is (n c)/(n c), so 1 + (v)/(n c) = (n c + v) / (n c )

So the denominator is (n c + v) / (n c )

So u is:

[ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Dividing these fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal:

( (c + n v ) / n ) * (n c ) / (n c + v )

The n's cancel in numerator and denominator:

= (c (c + n v )) / (n c + v )

Wait, but the denominator is (n c + v ), and the numerator is c*(c +n v )

Hmm, let me make sure. Let's compute the numerator:

(c + n v) * c = c² + n c v.

Denominator: (n c + v ) = same as (c n + v )

So u = (c² + n c v ) / (c n + v )

Factor out c in numerator and denominator:

Wait numerator: c(c + n v )

Denominator: (c n + v ) = (n c + v )

Wait, so we have u = c (c + n v ) / (n c + v )

Hmm, but this doesn't look like any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) (1 + n*v)/(n +v )

B) 1

C) (1 +n*v)/(n -v )

D) (1 -n*v)/(n +v )

Wait, but wait. Oh, because in the problem statement, the speed of light in vacuum is given as c=1. So c=1, so all the c's I used are 1.

So let me substitute c=1. So u becomes:

u = (1^2 + n*1*v ) / (n *1 + v ) = (1 +n v )/(n + v )

Which is option A.

Wait, but I thought the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but when the glass is moving, the observed speed in the lab frame is (1 +n v )/(n + v )

Wait, but that's more than 1? Because if v is positive and n is greater than 1, then numerator and denominator are both positive. Let's see, if n=1, the speed would be (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1. That makes sense because if n=1, it's a vacuum, and the speed is 1 regardless of the medium's motion.

Wait, but wait, if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, then the light's speed in the lab frame should be a bit higher than c/n, but since c=1, and n is >=1, c/n <=1. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here because when the medium moves, the speed shouldn't exceed c. Wait, but according to this, if v is positive and n is 2, then (1 + 2v)/(2 +v ). Suppose v is large, say v approaches 1 (since speeds can't exceed c, but let's say v=0.5). Then (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 +0.5 )= (1+1)/2.5 = 2/2.5=0.8, which is less than 1. That makes sense.

Wait, but if v is negative, meaning the glass is moving opposite to the light's direction, what happens? Let's say v is negative. For example, v= -0.5. Then (1 +n*(-0.5))/(n + (-0.5))= (1 - 0.5 n )/(n-0.5 ). Let me choose n=2. Then (1-1)/(2-0.5)=0/(1.5)=0. So the light's speed would be zero? That seems odd. Wait, but if the glass is moving opposite to the light, but the light in the glass is moving toward the observer, which is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the directions.

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, so the glass's velocity is in the same direction as the beam. So v is positive in this case.

But in any case, the calculation using the velocity addition formula gives u = (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the speed of light in the glass is c/n in its rest frame. When the glass is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light, what do we observe?

In the lab frame, the speed is u = (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n * v)/c² )

Which simplifies to u = ( (1 + n v )/(n) ) / ( 1 + v/(n c) )

But c=1, so u = (1 +n v )/(n (1 + v/(n )) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (1 +n v )/(n +v )

Which is the same as before. So yes, the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The glass itself is moving at velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer in the laboratory.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

Now, substitute back into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option B**: \( 1 \) would only be valid if the medium were a vacuum, which is not the case here.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) incorrectly assumes a different sign convention for the velocity \( v \).
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is invalid as it introduces an incorrect numerator.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
