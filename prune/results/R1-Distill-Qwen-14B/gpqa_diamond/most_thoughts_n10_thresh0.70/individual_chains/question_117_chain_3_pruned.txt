Alright, so I have this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by recalling what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the compound isn't superimposable on its mirror image. This leads to two non-superimposable mirror images, which are called enantiomers, and these can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.

So the question lists four organic moieties and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining different numbers.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Hmm, biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism if there's a substituent on each phenyl ring in such a way that the arrangement around the central bond can't be mirrored. Biphenyls can have either the trans or cis configuration, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral. Wait, but if the substituents are on the same positions on each ring, like 6,6' and 2,2', does that create a plane of symmetry?

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions. So each phenyl ring has two substituents: a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Let me imagine the structure. On each benzene ring, there are two substituents. The positions 2 and 6 are opposite (para) on each ring? Wait, the numbering on biphenyl might be different, but assuming the substituents are in such a way that each ring has the same substituents in symmetrical positions.

Wait, the compound is dimethyl, so the ester groups are at 2 and 2', and the nitro groups are at 6 and 6'.
