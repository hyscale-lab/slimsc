Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again. It says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet range. Lyman alpha is a specific transition in hydrogen, right? So when a quasar emits light, some of it gets absorbed by neutral hydrogen clouds. This absorption creates a line in the spectrum, called the Lyman-alpha forest. But wait, for us to observe this absorption, the wavelength of the absorbed light must be in the visible spectrum when it reaches us, because ground-based telescopes can't see ultraviolet light effectively due to atmospheric absorption.

So, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit * (1 + z). Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me think. The emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame. But because the cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer, right? Because redshift stretches the wavelength.

So, the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). But optical telescopes can only see up to about 1 micron, which is 10,000 Angstroms. So, we need lambda_obs <= 10,000 Angstroms for the ground-based optical telescopes to detect it.

So, setting up the equation: 1216 * (1 + z) <= 10,000. Let's solve for z.

1 + z = 10,000 / 1216 ≈ let me calculate that. 10,000 divided by 1216 is roughly... Well, 1216 * 8 is 9728, because 1216 * 8 = 9728. So 10,000 minus 9728 is 272. So 1216*8.2 is 9728 + (0.2 *1216) = 9728 + 243.2= 9971.2. Hmm, that's still under 10,000. Maybe 8.23. Let's do it more accurately.

10,000 / 1216 = let me compute 1216 *8=9728. 10,000-9728=272. 272/1216 = 0.2236. So 8.2236. So (1 + z) ≈8.2236. So z ≈7.2236.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are up to 3. Did I get something wrong? Oh wait, wait. Because the clouds are in front of the quasars, their redshifts are lower than the quasar's. Wait no, wait again. Wait, the quasar is the background object, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So the quasar's emission is redshifted, and the absorption lines are at a slightly lower redshift than the quasar. But in this question, the quasar's redshift isn't given. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait no, the question is about the clouds. The clouds are at some redshift z_cloud. The quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar. Because the quasar is behind the cloud, so its light passes through the cloud. The Lyman-alpha absorption from the cloud would be at the cloud's redshift.

Wait, but the question says the clouds are in deep space, and they absorb the quasar's light. The quasar's light has to pass through the clouds to reach us. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the clouds. So for the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be in the optical range, what's the required z_cloud?

Wait, the quasar's light emits at 1216 Angstroms (the Lyman-alpha emission line), but the neutral hydrogen in the cloud at redshift z_cloud will absorb light that is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame. So the quasar's light, when it reaches the cloud, is at wavelength 1216 Angstroms. But because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, the observed
