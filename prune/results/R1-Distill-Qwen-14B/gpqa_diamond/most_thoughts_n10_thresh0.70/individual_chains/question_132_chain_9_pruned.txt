Alright, I'm trying to solve this NMR question. Let's see what the problem says. So, we have a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that aromatic compounds with substituents can cause the protons on the ring to split into different signals depending on their environment. In such cases, symmetry plays a big role. For example, para-substituted rings might have fewer signals because of equivalent protons.

Looking at the aromatic signals: two singlets each integrating to 1:1 ratio. So each singlet must come from a different compound. Each compound contributes one singlet. So each of the two compounds must have only one type of aromatic proton, meaning their structures must provide that kind of symmetry.

Wait, but if each compound contributes one singlet, then each must have all equivalent aromatic protons. How is that possible? Oh, maybe each is highly symmetrical. Like, if the substituents are arranged in a way that all the remaining protons are equivalent.

Let me think about the options given. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene. Let's list them:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4.

Option C: 1,2,3,5 and 1,4-diethyl.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have ethyl groups in para positions. The other options are all tetramethyl.

I think I should analyze each compound's structure to see their aromatic protons.

Let's start with each compound:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: So the substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. If I imagine the benzene ring, substituents are on adjacent positions (1 and 2), then 4 and 5 are also adjacent. Wait, no, 1-2 are adjacent, but 4 and 5 are adjacent in the ring as well. Wait, the actual numbering might make this a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps better to draw it.

Wait, numbering a benzene ring, 1,2,4,5 would have substituents in such a way that the ring has symmetry. Maybe it's like a 1,2-dimethyl and 4,5-dimethyl. Hmm, but how does that affect the aromatic protons.

Alternatively, maybe 1,2,4,5 is actually a 1,2 and 4,5 positions, which could be a symmetric arrangement, perhaps leading to equivalent protons.

Wait, maybe it's more about the number of equivalent protons. If a compound has multiple substituents that make
