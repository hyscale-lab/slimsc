Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the reagents A and B involved in these two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nucleophiles, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. So, butan-2-one has a carbonyl group, and adding a nucleophile like CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, NaCN provides CN- as the nucleophile, right? So the reaction would proceed by the CN- attacking the carbonyl, opening it up, and then what?

Oh right, after the nucleophilic addition, there's an elimination step. Typically, you need an acid catalyst for that. Wait, but waitâ€”what happens in such cases? So if the ketone is treated with a cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst, the mechanism is like this: the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, which then gets protonated, and then water leaves, forming an imine or something? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: when a ketone reacts with HCN (or a cyanide source), it's a nucleophilic addition. But in the presence of an acid, like H3O+ as a catalyst, perhaps? So, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) would react with NaCN and H3O+ (option A or B) as the acid. Let me think about the product.

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? Because 2 is the carbonyl position. So the structure is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and an acid, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the product structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons, but maybe
