Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the scenario is a scientist is running a qPCR and wants to make a calibration curve. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in a series. He ran three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency of the qPCR was 100%, which is perfect, right? Because 100% efficiency means each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² was 1, so that's a perfect correlation between the dilutions and the Ct values. The slope was -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope in qPCR is related to efficiency. The formula for the slope is log( efficiency ) * (-1), I think. So if efficiency is 100%, that's 1, so log(1) is 0. But wait, sometimes the formula is based on 100% efficiency being slope of -3.322? Let me think. Oh right, because the formula is slope = ( - log(efficiency) ) * ln(10) or something like that. Wait, the standard formula for the slope in a qPCR calibration curve when using a 10-point dilution is slope = -3.3219 if efficiency is 100%. So in this case, the slope is -3.3, which is close enough, considering possible rounding. So that's good.

Now, looking at his results:

At 100,000 copies/µl, the Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2.

At 10,000 copies, 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average around 30.9.

At 1,000, 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average ~27.6.

At 100, 24, 24.3, 24.6. Avg ~24.3.

At 10, 20.7, 21, 21.3. Avg around 21.

So each dilution is 10-fold less than the previous. Because 100,000 -> 10,000 is a 10x dilution, and so on down to 10.

In a perfect scenario, each 10-fold dilution would increase Ct by 3.3219 cycles. Wait, because each Ct cycle corresponds to a doubling. So a 10-fold decrease (dilution) would require about 3.32 cycles more. Because 2^3.32 ≈ 10, since 2^3=8 and 2^3.32 is about 10. So in a perfect 100% efficient reaction, each dilution step should cause the Ct to increase by about 3.32.

Looking at the data:

From 10,000 to 100,000: 30.9 to 34.2. The difference is about 3.3. That's exactly what's expected.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, 100,000 is higher concentration than 10,000, so lower Ct. Oh wait, no, higher concentration would mean more copies, so the Ct would be lower. So in the data, as concentration increases, Ct decreases, which makes sense. So the Ct at 100,000 is ~34, which is higher than 10,000 which is ~30.9. Wait, no, wait: 34 is higher than 30.9, but higher concentration should lead to lower Ct. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait no, higher concentration means more target, so the amplification happens faster. So lower Ct values. So 100,000 is higher concentration than 10,000, so Ct should be lower. Oh, but in the data, 100,000 has a Ct of ~34, and 10,000 has ~30.9. So 100,000 is higher concentration but higher Ct. Wait, that's opposite of what should happen. Did I get that wrong?

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. If you have more target DNA, the Ct should be lower because it reaches the threshold sooner. So a higher concentration (like 100,000 copies/µl
