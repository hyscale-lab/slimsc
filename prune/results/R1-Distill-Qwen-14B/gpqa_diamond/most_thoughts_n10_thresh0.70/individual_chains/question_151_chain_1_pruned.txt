Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that when you have an observable, it's represented by an operator, and the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors.

The problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but usually in quantum mechanics, states are represented as vectors, and these vectors should be normalized. So I should probably check if this vector is normalized first. To do that, I need to calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components.

So the vector is (-1, 2, 1). The squares are (-1)^2 = 1, 2^2 =4, and 1^2=1. Adding them up: 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. I think I'll need to normalize it before proceeding because probabilities depend on normalized states.

Wait, but maybe the observable's measurement doesn't require the state to be normalized? Or does it? Hmm, I think the probabilities are calculated using the inner product with the eigenvectors, so the state should be normalized. So I should first normalize the state vector.

So the normalized state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So it becomes (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Next, the observable is given by matrix P. Let me write down P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators because their eigenvalues (the possible measurement outcomes) are real. Is P a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Since all elements here are real, except 1/sqrt(2), which is real, so the transpose of P is:

First row: 0,
