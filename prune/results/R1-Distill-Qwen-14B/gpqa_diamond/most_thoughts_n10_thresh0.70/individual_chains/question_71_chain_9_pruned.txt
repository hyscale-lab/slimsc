Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star they're orbiting and their distance from it. Oh wait, the formula I think is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe it's more about the inverse square law. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), assuming a circular orbit and no greenhouse effect. Or wait, another version: the temperature scales with the inverse square root of the distance from the star. Because the energy received is proportional to 1/(a²), so the temperature, which depends on the fourth root of energy, would be (1/(a²))^(1/4) = 1/(a^(1/2)). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

In this problem, all planets have the same albedo, so the albedo doesn't affect the ratio. Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on their orbital distances.

The orbital periods are given as a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, but Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Oh right, because P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So, P² ∝ a³. So a ∝ P^(2/3).

So for each planet, a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant for all planets since they orbit the same star.

But since we're looking for the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, let's compute a_4 / a_2.

Wait, their periods are P_4 = 3.5 and P_2 = 2. So the ratio a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3).

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 = 7/4. Hmm, taking (7/4)^(2/3). Let me calculate this.

First, 7/4 is 1.75. The cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2 (since 1.2³ is 1.728), so 1.
