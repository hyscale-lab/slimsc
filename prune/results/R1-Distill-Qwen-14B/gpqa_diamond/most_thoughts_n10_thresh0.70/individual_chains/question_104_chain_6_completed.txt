Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet, the bigger the shift, but wait, I think it's also dependent on the orbit and the mass.

The question says both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So the masses of the planets are the same, right? Because Neptune is roughly the same in both cases. So planet 1 and planet 2 have the same mass.

The RV shift is given in milliangstroms. Planet 1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet 2 is 7. I think the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period or maybe the velocity of the star's movement. Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity toward us. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) ) / c. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula that relates the RV signal to the parameters.

Wait, another approach: the semi-amplitude of the RV method is given by K = (v) which is related to ( (P) )^(1/3) and other factors. Or perhaps K is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )? Or wait, maybe it's K proportional to (P )^(-1/3). Because I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So simplifying:

K ≈ (G^{1/3} * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star)^{2/3} * (2π c^3)^{1/3} * P^{1/3} ) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(-2/3) ) ) * ( (P/(2π))^(-1/3) ) ) ]^(1/1)

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward to recall that when two planets have the same mass and their stars have the same mass, the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P. Because K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^{1/3} )

Wait, but wait, the exact formula is K = ( (v_0) ) where v_0 is the star's velocity. The formula is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so this becomes approximately:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Now, since both stars have the same mass, and both planets have the same mass, and sin i is roughly the same (assuming similar orbital inclinations, which I think for this problem we can assume because they're both detected, so their inclinations are similar). So K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}.

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^{1/3} / (P1/P2)^{1/3} } No, wait, let me think. Let me denote K1 for Planet 1 as 5 milliangstroms, K2 as 7.

Wait, the problem states that K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 is larger than K1.

But according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}. So if K2 > K1, then P2 must be shorter than P1? Because higher K implies lower P.

Wait, that can't be right because the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, wait, perhaps I have it backwards.

Wait, wait, let me think again. From K1 = (some constant) * (1 / P1^{1/3}).

Similarly, K2 = same constant * (1 / P2^{1/3}).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2^{1/3}) / (P1^{1/3} )

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We can rearrange that to find (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, because (K1/K2) = (P2^{1/3}) / (P1^{1/3}) )

So, (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait that makes sense. Because if K increases, P decreases, so P2 would be smaller than P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is longer, then the ratio would be greater than 1. If P2 is shorter, then the ratio is less than 1.

Wait, let me compute the ratio.

K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So (K1/K2) is 5/7.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So that would mean P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364. So the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. That would be P2/P1 = 0.364, which is less than 1, meaning P2 is shorter.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, etc. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be 0.36 times, so option A.

Wait, but let me check again. Because sometimes when I'm confused about the direction, I might mix up.

So, let me think, K is proportional to (1 / P^{1/3} ), so higher K means shorter period. So if K2 is higher than K1 (7>5), then P2 is shorter than P1. So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, no, wait.

We have K1 = (constant) / P1^{1/3}.

Similarly, K2 = (constant) / P2^{1/3}.

So, K1/K2 = (P2^{1/3} )/(P1^{1/3} ) )

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter, so the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's 0.364 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

Yes, that's what I have.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the planet. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \). Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the two stars have the same mass and the two planets have the same mass, the RV semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) for the two planets are inversely proportional to the cube roots of their orbital periods \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \). This relationship can be written as:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of the orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1.
