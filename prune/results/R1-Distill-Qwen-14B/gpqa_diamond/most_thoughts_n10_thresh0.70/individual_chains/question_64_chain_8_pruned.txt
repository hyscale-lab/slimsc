Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through three different tubes: one with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, another with Ca(OH)2 solution, and a third with red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Also, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out what's happening in each step. Let's break it down.

First, when salts A and B are heated, they produce gases. The setup of the tubes is to collect and react these gases. Let's think about each tube's function.

Tube 1 is filled with Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent and can react with water vapor. Wait, but wait—Mg(ClO4)2 is also a drying agent. So if the gas mixture has water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would trap it, increasing the tube's weight. So the increase of 3.60g in tube 1 suggests that 3.60g of H2O was present in the gases.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas mixture contains CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But in this case, the weight of tube 2 didn't change. That implies that either no CO2 was present, or the amount of CO2 was so small that the solution's mass didn't increase. Wait, but if CO2 was present, it would cause a reaction. So maybe there was no CO2, or perhaps the Ca(OH)2 was in excess and didn't show a change in weight because it's a solution and might not precipitate? Hmm, I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the gas that reacts here is something else. Wait, another possibility: if the gas is H2S, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the gas is HCl? But Mg(ClO4)2 wouldn't trap HCl. Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a salt, so maybe it's a dehydrating agent for other gases... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. Copper at high temperatures can react with certain gases. Like, for example, H2 can be oxidized to H2O, and maybe CO can be oxidized. But wait, the product is CuO, which implies that the gas is H2 or another reducing agent. Wait, when H2 is passed over hot Cu, it would actually reduce CuO to Cu, but if the gas is H2, then in the presence of oxygen, it would form H2O. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, which can be oxidized to CO2. But in the presence of Cu, perhaps it's H2 reacting.

Wait, but the problem says that CuO is formed in tube 3. So that suggests that the gas is H2. Because when H2 is passed over hot CuO, it can reduce it, but wait, that's the opposite. Alternatively, if the gas is O2, but that wouldn't react with Cu. Hmm, maybe the gas is something like CO which, upon oxidation, forms CO2, but I'm not
