Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit challenging, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part is about a reaction involving 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base. The product is labeled A. The second part involves 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water, giving product B. I need to choose the correct major products from the options provided.

Starting with the first reaction. I remember that when a ketone reacts with an enolate, it's usually an aldol addition. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated group. So maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of Michael addition? Or perhaps it's a Claisen-like condensation. Hmm.

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize the structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1, which is the same as the 6 position in some numbering systems. Wait, no, wait. Let's think: in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at position 1. So 2-ethyl would be adjacent to the carbonyl. Oh wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one: the carbonyl is at 1, and there's an ethyl group at 2, and methyl groups at 2 and 6. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

Cyclohexane ring: position 1 is the carbonyl (O). Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Position 6 has a methyl group. So the ring looks like this: at position 1, ketone; position 2, ethyl and methyl; position
