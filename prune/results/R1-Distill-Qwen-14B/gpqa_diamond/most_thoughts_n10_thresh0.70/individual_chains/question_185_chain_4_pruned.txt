Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian give the possible energy levels of the system.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ are the Pauli matrices, right? And n is a unit vector, so it's a direction in space. Since it's a dot product, σ·n would be summing the components like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z multiplied by the respective components of n. So n is (n_x, n_y, n_z), and each component is squared to 1 since it's a unit vector.

I think the Pauli matrices are all Hermitian and have eigenvalues ±1. Wait, each Pauli matrix's eigenvalues are ±1. But when you take a linear combination like σ·n, which is σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, what happens? Oh, right, because each Pauli matrix is multiplied by a component of n, which is a unit vector, the entire expression σ·n should also be a Hermitian operator since each σ_i is Hermitian and n is real.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of H. But wait, H is ε times σ·n. So the eigenvalues of σ·n would determine the eigenvalues of H when multiplied by ε.

Wait, what's the trace of σ·n? The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. For each Pauli matrix, the trace is zero. So when you take a linear combination, the trace would still be zero. That suggests that the eigenvalues are plus and minus some value, because the sum of eigenvalues equals the trace, which is zero. So the eigenvalues would be a and -a for some a.

What about the determinant? The determinant of σ·n—each Pauli matrix has determinant -1
