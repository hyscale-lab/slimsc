Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with different velocities.

Hmm, annihilation usually involves matter and antimatter particles annihilating each other and producing other particles. So, a proton and antiproton collide and produce two A+ and two A- particles. I'm assuming A+ and A- are some kind of mesons or other particles, but their exact identity might not matter here. The important thing is their mass.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy? If it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate using non-relativistic physics, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Alternatively, since the problem gives a specific mass for A, maybe it's a relativistic problem.

Let me think about conservation laws. In any reaction, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is small, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let's consider their rest masses. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². Since the antiproton is its antiparticle, it has the same mass. So m_p c² is about 938 MeV. So m_p c² ≈ m_pbar c² ≈ 938 MeV.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So the initial kinetic energy is
