Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm... Let me think.

I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance (d-spacing) is calculated using something called the Bragg equation, but wait, no, Bragg's law is more about the relationship between wavelength, angle, and the d-spacing. Oh wait, no, the formula for d is derived from the crystal structure.

So, for a general cubic system, the interplanar distance is given by the formula d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something with the angles... Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a cubic crystal, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), but that's only for a cubic system where the angles are all 90 degrees. But here, it's a rhombohedral crystal, so the angles are different. Oh right, in rhombohedral systems, the formula involves the angles between the lattice parameters.

I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is: d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure factor for a rhomboh
