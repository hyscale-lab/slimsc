Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, twice as excited... I think that refers to the excitation level or the number of atoms in an excited state. Oh right, in stellar atmospheres, when we talk about excitation, it's about the proportion of atoms in a particular energy state. So the ratio of the excited states between the two stars is 2:1 for star_1 to star_2.

And the energy difference between these levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's probably the value of ΔE, the energy difference between the two levels involved in the excitation. So ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J.

The problem says that the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That means the usual laws of thermodynamics and Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution apply. So the excitation levels are determined by the thermal energy of the stars.

I remember that the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is N_upper / N_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors), and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is the same for both stars, since it's the same transition in iron. So for star_1 and star_2, ΔE is the same. Let's call the ratio of excited to ground state for star_1 as N1 and for star_2 as N2. Wait, but the question says that star_1 has twice as excited as star_2. So N1 = 2 * N2?

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is (excited in star_1)/(excited in star_2) = 2/1. But wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe the ratio is (N_upper,N1 / N_lower,N1) = 2 * (N_upper,N2 / N_lower,N2). Hmm, wait, perhaps the ratio of their exc
