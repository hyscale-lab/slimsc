Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, so LTE applies here.

Wait, when they say the atoms are twice as excited, I think that refers to the population of a higher energy level. So if the energy levels are quantized, the excitation here means the number of atoms in a particular excited state. In LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels. The ratio of the populations (N2/N1) is equal to (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. Let me think: the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So N1/N2 = 2? Or wait, wait, no. The wording is a bit tricky. The energy levels were considered, and the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So if the higher energy level is considered, then the population there is higher for star_1.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The energy levels are fixed; the excitation refers to how many atoms are in that specific energy level. So for a certain energy level, the number of atoms in that level (say level 2) relative to a lower level (level 1) depends on temperature.

The problem states that the excitation (population) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for each star, the ratio is N_upper/N_lower. Let's say for star_1, it's 2 times that of star_2. Wait, no. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

So when comparing the same energy level, star_1 has twice the population of that level as star_2. So N1 (for star_1) is twice N2 (for star_2) for the same energy level. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Wait, the energy levels are the same for both stars. So for each star, the population in a certain level is determined by their respective temperature.

Wait, the energy difference is the same for both stars because it's the same transition in iron. So for each star, the ratio of N_upper to N_lower is given by (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But in this problem, we're only comparing the populations in the same energy level between the stars. Let me clarify: when the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, it's probably
