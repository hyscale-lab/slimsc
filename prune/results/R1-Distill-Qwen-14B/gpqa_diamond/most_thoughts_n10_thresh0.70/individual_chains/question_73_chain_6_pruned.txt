Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So I guess I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, I can't just subtract them normally because that would give an answer faster than light, which isn't possible. I remember that you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Let me recall the formula.

The relative velocity formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, no. Wait, if object A is moving at u and object B at v, then the relative speed of A with respect to B is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Like, if I'm moving at u and you're moving at v, but I need to see from your frame, then I would be moving at (u - v)/(1 - (u*v/c²)) relative to you.

So in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. Let me say astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. So from B's frame, what is A's speed?

Wait wait, no. Wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. So if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ 0.142857c. Which is approximately 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.
