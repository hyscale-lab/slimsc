Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, the question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. Right, so c is the speed of light, which is important because we're dealing with relativity here.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, because both are moving in the same direction, to find the relative speed of one with respect to the other, you use v = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²))). Or is it (v2 - v1) depending on the perspective? Wait, maybe I should be precise.

Alternatively, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the 2m astronaut from the 3m astronaut's frame would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) where v2 is the speed of the 3m astronaut and v1 is the speed of the 2m astronaut. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the 3m astronaut is moving at 0.5c, the
