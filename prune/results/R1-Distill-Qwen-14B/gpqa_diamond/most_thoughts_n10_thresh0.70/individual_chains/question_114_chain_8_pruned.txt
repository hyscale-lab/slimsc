Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Hmm, I remember from my notes that these kinds of reactions often involve substitution or addition mechanisms.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. I think when a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN-, it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, I've heard of the Stephen reduction or maybe the formation of cyanohydrins. 

Cyanohydrin formation occurs when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. So for the first step, the reagent A should be a strong acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B), or maybe something else like H2SO4? But looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3 in some cases.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That structure has both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile on the same carbon. So yes, that's exactly what a cyanohydrin is. So the first reagent A must be an acid to catalyze the addition of CN- to the ketone.

So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+ because that's a strong acid, and it's an option in A and B.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, looking at this, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. There are different ways to do this. One is using a strong acid like HCl in aqueous conditions, and another is using a base with heat. Wait, what's reagent B? The options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, the second part says B is H2O. Wait, the second reaction is: compound + B (H2O) â†’ product. Oh, I think I got it wrong earlier. Let me read that again.

Ah, no, the question says: reagent B is H2O. Wait, no, the way it's written is a bit confusing. The second reaction is, when you add reagent B to the starting material and H2O, you get the product. Or wait, perhaps the starting material is treated with reagent B in the presence of H2O. Or maybe reagent B is an acid or base in the hydrolysis.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutan
