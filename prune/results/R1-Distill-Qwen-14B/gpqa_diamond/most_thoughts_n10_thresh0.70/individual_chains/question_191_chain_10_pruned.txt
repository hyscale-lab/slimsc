Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the structure of product 4 is. Let's take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw that structure mentally. So, cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so -CH2OH attached to carbon 3). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure for prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2 with the double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think. Propene has three carbons with a double bond. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2, but wait, that's not possible because propene is CH2=CH-CH3. So the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C-CH2? Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2- but where? Let me clarify. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually (CH2=CHCH2- )? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is the group attached to the cyclohexane. So prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2 where the point of attachment is the middle carbon. No, wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting
