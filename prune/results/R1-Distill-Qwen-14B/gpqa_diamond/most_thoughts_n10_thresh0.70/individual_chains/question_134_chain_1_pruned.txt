Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Hmm, the question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, since there are three solutions here, I need to think about how they interact.

Let me list out the given data. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I think the first step is to figure out the moles of each acid and base because the neutralization reaction depends on the mole ratio.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole of HCl will donate one H+ ion. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but as a diprotic acid, meaning each mole can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Since Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions, each mole will provide two OH- ions.

Wait, but when mixing acid and base, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate the moles of HCl. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). HCl is 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. It's 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But because it's diprotic, 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Then, Ba(OH)2. It's 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when you mix the acid and base, they'll neutralize to form water. So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The neutralization will proceed until one is used up. Since OH- is less, all OH- will react, and some H+ will be left. The excess H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait, does that mean the reaction is not complete? Or does the problem consider only the neutralization that occurs?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the limiting reagent. The OH- is 0.2 moles. So, the H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, since that's the limiting reagent.

So, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. The enthalpy change for this reaction would be based on the moles that actually react.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) because each mole of H+ reacting releases about 57.3 kJ. So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57.3) kJ = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ.

But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options. Option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, but wait, I think the standard value is in kJ, so if the calculation gives -11.46 kJ, that would be around -11.5 kJ. But none of the options exactly match that. Wait, looking at the options
