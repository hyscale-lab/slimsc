Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, so we're definitely dealing with relativistic effects here.

Wait, wait. I remember that in non-relativistic physics, the maximum speed in a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The formula is something like v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But this is a relativistic scenario, so that changes things.

In relativity, the equations get a bit more complicated because as speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. The energy-momentum relation comes into play, right? The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but in relativistic dynamics, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Hmm.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But in the relativistic case, how does that fit into the energy equations? Let's think about energy conservation. At maximum displacement (x=A), the mass is momentarily at rest, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is more complicated.

Wait, the total energy in special relativity is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But here, the oscillator is a conservative system, so the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be conserved. So, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't simply (γ-1)mc²? So, when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is (γ)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, the maximum speed occurs when the oscillator is at x=0, so the velocity is maximum there. So, let me set up the energy equation. The total energy at maximum displacement (x=A) should equal the total energy when the oscillator is at x=0.

Wait, but the potential energy at x=A is (1/2)kA². So, the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy mc²? No, wait, no. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². But that's non-relativistic.

Wait, maybe I should be considering the relativistic energy. Let me think again. When the oscillator is at x=A, it's at rest, so its energy is all potential plus its rest mass energy. But in the relativistic oscillator, does the potential energy contribute to the total energy in a different way? Or perhaps, the potential and kinetic energies are treated as parts of the total energy, which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps the total mechanical energy (E) is given by E = (1/2)kA² + mc². No, that can't be right. Because in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², and the rest energy is separate. But in relativity, energy is different.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try setting up the energy conservation equation.

At x = A, the mass is momentarily at rest, so the velocity is zero. The total energy E is the sum of potential energy and the rest mass energy. So,

E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, no. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², and the rest mass energy is mc², which is a separate thing. But in relativity, I think the total energy includes both rest mass and kinetic, so maybe E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or perhaps the potential energy is part of the total energy, including rest mass. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is part of the total mechanical energy, which is equal to the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the energy at the equilibrium point. At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. The kinetic energy in relativity is E_kin = (γ - 1)mc². So the total energy E is (γ - 1)mc² + 0 = (γ -1)mc².

But earlier, at x=A, the total energy is (1/2)kA² + something. Wait, perhaps the total energy is (1/2)kA² plus the rest mass energy? No, because in the non-relativistic case, when you have a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is when all potential energy converts to kinetic, so E = (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA².

But in relativity, the same idea applies, but the energies are different. So, perhaps the total mechanical energy (E) is (1/2)kA², and when the oscillator is at x=0, all that energy is kinetic.

But wait, in relativity, when you have kinetic energy, it's (γ-1)mc². So setting that equal to (1/2)kA²:

(γ -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, perhaps the total mechanical energy is the sum of potential and kinetic, but in relativity, the kinetic energy is treated differently. So, let me try to write that.

At x=A: E = (1/2)kA² + K, where K is the kinetic energy. But wait, at x=A, the velocity is zero, so K=0. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that's the same as non-relativistic. But in reality, in relativity, the rest mass energy is already part of the total energy. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the relativistic energy equation. The total energy is E = γ mc². The potential energy is (1/2)kx². So, the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy should be equal to E. So:

E = (1/2)kA² + K.

But E is also equal to γ mc².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the situation when the oscillator is at x=0. Then the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So, at x=0, E = K = (γ -1) mc².

But at x=A, E = (1/2)kA² + (1/2)mv²? No, wait, that's not right because in relativity, the kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv².

Wait, perhaps I should think of the energy at x=A as the sum of potential and rest energy. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Let me try another approach. Let me write down the expressions for energy in the system.

The potential energy is U = (1/2)k x².

The kinetic energy is K = (γ -1) mc².

So, the total energy E is U + K.

At maximum displacement, x = A, the velocity is zero, so γ =1, because v=0. So, K=0. Therefore, E = (1/2)k A².

But at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so E = K = (γ -1) mc².

So, setting E equal in both cases: (1/2)k A² = (γ -1) mc².

So, solving for γ:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

But γ is also 1/√(1 - v²/c²), where v is the maximum speed. At x=0, the speed is maximum.

So,

1/√(1 - (v_max)^2/c²) ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me write it as:

1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) = 1/√(1 - (v_max)^2/c² )

Now, let's solve for v_max.

Take reciprocal of both sides:

√(1 - (v_max)^2/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ]

Square both sides:

1 - (v_max)^2/c² = 1 / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) )^2 ]

Rearrange to solve for (v_max)^2:

(v_max)^2/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 mc²)))^2 ]

Factor the right side:

= [ (1 + (k A²/(2 mc²))^2 - 1 ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²/(2 mc²)) )^2 ]

Wait, perhaps that's more complicated. Let me compute it as is.

1 - [1 / (1 + a )² ] where a = k A²/(2 mc²).

So,

1 - [1/(1+a)^2] = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding (1+a)^2: 1 + 2a + a².

So numerator becomes (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) = 2a + a².

So,

(v_max)^2/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a )^2.

Factor numerator: a(2 + a).

Denominator: (1+a)^2.

So,

(v_max)^2 = c² * [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Wait, but a is (k A²)/(2 mc²). Let me substitute that.

a = (k A²) / (2 mc²).

So,

2 + a = 2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) = [4 mc² + k A² ]/(2 mc²).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to substitute the value of a into the expression.

So,

(v_max)^2 = c² * [ (k A²/(2 mc²)) * (2 + k A²/(2 mc²)) ] / [ (1 + k A²/(2 mc²) )^2 ]

Hmm, this looks complicated. Let me try simplifying the numerator and denominator.

Let me compute each part:

First, the numerator inside the brackets:

(k A²/(2 mc²)) * (2 + k A²/(2 mc²)) )

= (k A²/(2 mc²)) * [ (4 mc² + k A² ) / (2 mc²) ) ]

Wait, let me write 2 as (4 mc²)/(2 mc²) * 2 mc² / (2 mc²). No, maybe better to multiply the terms.

Let me compute 2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ) = [ (4 mc²) + k A² ] / (2 mc² )

So, the numerator becomes:

(k A²/(2 mc²)) * [ (4 mc² + k A²) / (2 mc²) ) ]

= [ k A² (4 mc² + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator of the big fraction is (1 + a )^2 = [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²) ) ]^2 = [ (2 mc² + k A² )/(2 mc²) ) ]^2 = (2 mc² + k A² )^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

(v_max)^2 = c² * [ numerator ] / [ denominator ]

= c² * [ k A² (4 mc² + k A²) / (4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 mc² + k A²)^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

Simplify the denominators:

The denominators 4 m² c^4 cancel out.

So,

= c² * [ k A² (4 mc² + k A²) ] / (2 mc² + k A² )^2 )

Hmm, let me factor this. Let me denote b = k A²/(2 mc²). Then, 4 mc² + k A² = 2 mc² * 2 + k A^2 = 2 mc² (2) + k A^2. Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: Let me factor 4 mc² + k A² as 2 mc² * 2 + k A². Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me factor 4 mc² + k A² = (2 mc²) * 2 + k A².

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator terms. Let me see:

Numerator: k A² (4 mc² + k A²) = k A² [4 mc² + k A^2 ].

Denominator: (2 mc² + k A^2 )^2.

Hmm, I don't see an immediate simplification. Maybe I should consider an approximation, but the options don't seem to suggest an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should go back. Let me just write the expression I had before:

1/√(1 - (v_max)^2/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²)]^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²)]².

Wait, perhaps this can be rearranged to solve for v².

Let me compute the right-hand side.

Let me denote a = (k A²)/(2 mc²). So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a )^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1+a)^2.

Which is the same as,

v²/c² = [ (1 + a )^2 -1 ] / (1 + a )^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2a + a²) - 1 = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a )^2.

Factor numerator:

a(2 + a ) / (1 + a )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt [ a(2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )

Wait, substituting back a = (k A²)/(2 mc²):

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 mc²)) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 mc²)) ] ) / (1 + (k A²/(2 mc²)) )

This is getting complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate this expression.

Let me write it as:

v_max = c * sqrt[ (k A² (2 mc² + k A² )) / (2 mc²) ) ] / ( (2 mc² + k A² )/(2 mc²) ) )

Wait, perhaps I can factor this more cleverly.

Wait, the entire expression under the square root in the numerator is:

(k A² (2 mc² + k A² )) / (2 mc²) )

So the square root of that is sqrt[ (k A² (2 mc² + k A² )) / (2 mc^2) ) ]

And the denominator is [ (2 mc² + k A² )/(2 mc²) ) ]

So,

v_max = c * [ sqrt( (k A² (2 mc² + k A² )) ) / sqrt(2 mc^2) ) ] / [ (2 mc² + k A^2 )/(2 mc^2) ) ]

This is getting a bit too messy. Maybe I should think differently. Let me try to factor out terms.

Let me denote (k A²) as a variable, say, b.

Wait, Maybe another approach. Let me factor out 1/(2 mc²) from a.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of a.

Wait, perhaps I can write the expression for v_max in terms of a.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

But a = (k A²)/(2 mc²).

Let me write this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

We can write sqrt(a (2 + a)) as sqrt( a (a + 2) ) = sqrt( a^2 + 2a )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( a^2 + 2a ) / (1 + a )

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator inside the sqrt is a² + 2a = a(a + 2 ). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps express it as sqrt( (a + 1 )^2 -1 ), but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps we can factor the numerator and denominator.

Let me consider:

sqrt(a^2 + 2a ) = sqrt( a(a + 2) )

Denominator is (1 + a).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to square both sides and see if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression:

v_max = c * sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (a + 1 )

Hmm, maybe factor a from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps write a + 2 = (a +1 ) +1.

So,

a (a + 2 ) = a ( (a +1 ) +1 ) = a(a+1) + a.

But I don't see a clear simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps approximate for small a, but the problem doesn’t specify that a is small. So perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I can manipulate the expression to match one of the options.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 – (k A²)/(2 mc²) ) )

Wait, Let me compute 1 + [ 1/(1 – (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) ].

Wait, 1 + 1/(1 – a), where a = (k A^2)/(2 mc^2).

Wait, 1 + 1/(1 – a) = [ (1 – a) + 1 ] / (1 – a) ) = ( 2 – a )/(1 – a )

Hmm, but the expression I have for v_max is messy. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the equation:

1/√(1 - (v_max)^2/c²) ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 )

So, let me rewrite the left-hand side as gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc^2 )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc^2 )

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 )]^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 )]^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 )]^2.

Which can be written as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 ))^2 - 1 ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 ))^2 ]

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a )^2, where a = (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 )

Factor numerator: a (2 + a )

So,

v²/c² = [ a (2 + a ) ] / (1 + a )^2.

Which can be written as [ a (a + 2) ] / (a +1 )^2.

Hmm. Let me factor a as (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 ), so:

a = (k A^2)/(2 mc^2 )

So,

v² = c² [ a (a + 2) ] / (a + 1 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

v² = c² [ (a (a+2) ) ] / (a +1 )^2.

Let me try to compute the numerator and denominator:

a (a +2 ) = a^2 + 2a.

Denominator: (a +1 )^2 = a^2 + 2a +1.

So,

v² = c² [ (a^2 + 2a ) ] / (a^2 + 2a +1 )

= c² [ (a (a +2 )) / ( (a+1 )^2 ) ]

Wait, perhaps I can factor this as:

v² = c² * [ a (a +2 ) ] / ( (a+1 )^2 )

Hmm, but I don't see a way to relate this to the options.

Wait, let me compute v:

v = c * sqrt( [ a (a +2 ) ] ) / (a + 1 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( a (a+2) ) / (a +1 )

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

v = c * sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (a +1 )

= c * sqrt( (a^2 + 2a )/(a +1 )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (a^2 + 2a ) ) / (a +1 )

Hmm, perhaps that's a dead end.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m) )^2 )

Wait, that's not matching.

Option B: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, let me compute that.

1 + 1/(1 - a ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

1 + 1/(1 - a ) = [ (1 -a ) + 1 ]/(1 - a ) ) = ( 2 - a )/(1 -a )

So, v = c sqrt( (2 -a)/(1 -a ) )

Hmm, does this match what I have?

Wait, my expression for v is c multiplied by sqrt( [a (a + 2) ] ) / (a + 1 )

So let me compute [a (a +2) ] = a^2 + 2a.

So,

sqrt( (a^2 + 2a) ) / (a +1 ) ) = sqrt( a (a + 2) ) / (a +1 )

Hmm. Let me square it:

(a (a +2 )) / (a +1 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as:

(a (a +2 )) / (a +1 )^2 = [ (a^2 + 2a ) ] / (a^2 + 2a +1 )

= [ (a^2 + 2a +1 ) -1 ] / (a^2 + 2a +1 )

= 1 - 1/(a^2 + 2a +1 )

Wait, that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator.

Wait, a^2 + 2a = a(a +2 )

Denominator is (a +1 )^2.

So,

(a (a +2 )) / (a +1 )^2 = [a (a+2 ) ] / (a+1 )^2.

Hmm, perhaps there's a way to factor this differently.

Wait, what if a is much less than 1? Let me see what happens if a <<1.

Then,

a² is negligible, so numerator ~ 2 a.

Denominator ~ 1.

So,

v² ~ c² (2a ) = c² (k A^2)/(m c² ) ) * (1/(2 mc² )) ? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me compute.

Wait, a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

If a is small, then the denominator is approximately 1.

So,

v² ~ c^2 * (2a ) / 1.

So,

v_max ~ c * sqrt(2 a )

= c * sqrt( 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) )

= c * (A sqrt(k/m) ) / c )

= A sqrt(k/m )

Which is the non-relativistic result. So that makes sense.

So, in the non-relativistic limit (a <<1), the expression for v_max approaches the classical result.

Now, looking at the options, which option reduces to the non-relativistic case when a is small?

Let me check each option.

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A^2/m )

Which is the non-relativistic result. So, in the non-rel limit, all options should give this, but only option C gives that directly.

Wait, but for the relativistic case, when a is not small, which option would give the correct expression?

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option when a is small gives v_max = sqrt( kA²/m ) .

Let me compute each option:

Option C: gives the correct non-rel limit, but the question is about the relativistic case, so C must be wrong.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

When a is small,

1 + a ~1,

so 1/(1+a )^2 ~1 -2a.

So,

1 - (1/(1+a )^2 ) ~ 1 - (1 -2a ) = 2a.

So,

v_max ~ c * sqrt(2a ) = c * sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 / m ) = non-relativistic.

So, D also gives the correct non-rel limit.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 – a ) )

Wait, 1 + 1/(1 - a ) = (1 - a +1 )/(1 –a ) ) = (2 –a )/(1 –a )

When a is small,

(2 –a )/(1 –a ) ~ (2)(1 + a/2 ) ) / (1 – a )

~ 2 (1 + a/2 ) (1 +a )

~ 2 (1 + 3a/2 )

So,

sqrt( 2 (1 + 3a/2 ) ) ≈ sqrt(2) (1 + 3a/4 )

Multiply by c,

v_max ~ c sqrt(2 ) (1 + 3a/4 )

But in non-rel, v_max is sqrt(k A^2/m ) = c sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) = c sqrt( a * 2m c² / (2 m c^2 ) )) ?

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, perhaps let me compute the options for a small a.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 – a )^2 )

When a is small, 1/(1 – a )^2 ≈ 1 + 2a.

So,

1 +1/(1 -a )^2 ≈ 2 +2a.

Wait, so v_max ~ c sqrt(2 + 2 a )

Hmm, when a is small, this would be c * sqrt(2 (1 + a ) ) ~ c sqrt(2 ) (1 + a/2 )

But the non-rel limit is sqrt(k A^2/m ) = sqrt( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * 2 c^2 ) ) = sqrt( a * 2 c^2 ) = c sqrt(2 a )

So, for option A, when a is small, v_max is about c sqrt(2) (1 + a/2 ), which is larger than the non-rel value. So, A can't be correct.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 – a ) )

As a is small,

1/(1 -a ) ≈ 1 +a.

So,

1 + 1/(1 -a ) ≈ 2 +a.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt(2 +a )

Which when a is small is about c sqrt(2) (1 + a/(4) )

Hmm, when a is small, this gives a higher v_max than the non-rel result. So, perhaps that's not the right option.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 )

When a is small, 1/(1 +a )^2 ≈ 1 - 2a.

So,

1 - (1/(1 +a )^2 ) ≈ 1 - (1 -2a ) = 2a.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt(2a ) = same as non-rel limit. So D gives the correct non-rel limit.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 – a ) )

Wait, when a is small,

1/(1 –a ) ≈ 1 +a.

So,

1 + 1/(1 –a ) ≈ 2 +a.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt(2 +a ) ≈ c * sqrt(2) (1 + a/(4) )

Which is larger than the non-rel result c sqrt( 2a ). So this can't be correct.

Hmm, so options B and D give the correct non-rel limit. So which one is correct?

Wait, let me think back to my expression:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ a (a +2 ) ] ) / (a +1 )

Let me compute this for a being small.

a is small, so:

sqrt( a (a +2 ) ) ≈ sqrt( 2a (1 + a/2) ) ≈ sqrt(2a ) (1 + a/(4) )

Denominator: a +1 ≈1.

So,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt(2a ) (1 + a/4 )

Which for a small, is approximately c sqrt(2a ), which is same as the non-rel result.

So, which option gives v_max ≈ c sqrt(2a ) when a is small?

Let me compute each option when a is small.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 )

When a is small,

1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ≈ 1 - (1 -2a + 3a² ) ≈ 2a - 3a².

So,

sqrt(2a ) (1 - (3a)/4 )

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt(2a ) (1 - (3a)/4 )

Which is slightly less than the non-rel result. So, not matching my expression.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, let's compute (1 +a )^2 =1 + 2a +a².

1/(1 +a )^2 =1/(1 +2a +a² ) ≈ 1 - 2a +3a².

So,

1 - [1/(1+a )^2 ] ≈ 2a -3 a².

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 2a –3a² )

Which for small a is approximately c sqrt(2a ) (1 - (3a)/(4) )

Which is a bit less than the non-rel result.

But my expression for v_max is c * sqrt( [a(a+2) ] )/(a+1 ) ~ c * sqrt(2a (1 + a/2 )) / (1 +a ) ≈ c sqrt(2a ) (1 +a/4 )/(1 +a ) ≈ c sqrt(2a ) (1 -a/4 )

Hmm, which is a bit less than the non-rel.

So, in the small a limit, both D and my expression give v_max ~ c sqrt(2a ), but with higher order terms. So, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D: v_max= c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

In our expression, we have:

1 - (v_max^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + a )^2.

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2.

Which is exactly option D.

Wait, yes! So, because when I squared the equation, I arrived at v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2, where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 ( 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the options.

Looking back:

Option D: v_max= c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly what I have.

So, the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both potential energy and relativistic kinetic energy. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]  
   At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Rearranging for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Simplifying for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Matching with the Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately represents the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator derived from energy conservation principles.
