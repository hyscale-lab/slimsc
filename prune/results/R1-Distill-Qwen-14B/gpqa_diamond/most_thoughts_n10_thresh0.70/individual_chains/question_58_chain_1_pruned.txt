Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities can make the theory seem non-sensical, so regularization helps to make the math manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the divergences.

Wait, but when would a theory not need regularization? I think that if a theory is already finite, meaning it doesn't produce any infinities, then regularization wouldn't be necessary. Or maybe the theory is such that when you calculate loop diagrams, the divergences somehow cancel out.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I know string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity. It deals with strings vibrating at different frequencies to produce particles. I remember that in string theory, the infinities that usually plague quantum field theories don't occur because the underlying structure is different. Strings have a different way of interacting, and maybe their interactions don't lead to the same kinds of divergences. Or wait, does string theory require regularization? I'm not entirely sure. It's supposed to be a background-independent theory and is expected to be finite, but I'm not 100% certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD calculations often involve dealing with things like renormalization because the theory is not freeâ€”it has interactions. But wait, do they require regularization? I think that because QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory, it's a renormalizable theory. However, in practice, people use regularization techniques like lattice QCD to handle things like confinement and the running coupling. So QCD does require regularization, right? Or is it that the theory itself doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other theories?

Wait, no, regularization is more about handling loop divergences. QCD does have issues with things like the Landau pole, but I'm not sure. Maybe in certain formulations, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this point.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a well-established quantum field theory. I know that QED has divergent loop integrals, especially in calculations of things like the electron self-energy. So regularization is definitely used here, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. Without regularization, the theory would be problematic. So QED does require regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. So regularization is a quantum field theory concept. Classical theories don't have the same issues with infinities because they don't have the same mathematical structure. For example, in classical electromagnetism, you don't calculate loop diagrams or deal with renormalization. So if the question is about a theory that doesn't require regularization at high energies, this might be the answer because it's a classical theory, not a quantum one.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. So does classical electrodynamics even have issues at high energies? Well, in
