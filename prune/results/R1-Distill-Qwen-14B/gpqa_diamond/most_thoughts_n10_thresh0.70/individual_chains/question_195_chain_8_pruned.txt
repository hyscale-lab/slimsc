Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can still cause both transit and occultation events. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that transit and occultation events depend on the orbital periods of the planets and their alignment with the star. Transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we stop seeing its reflected light. Both events require the planets to be in the same orbital plane, which they are in this case.

The first planet has a radius of Earth, so R1 = 1 Earth radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet is larger, with R2 = 2.5 Earth radii. The star has a radius of 1.5 times the Sun's radius.

Wait, the key here is the orbital periods. For the second planet to show both transit and occultation, its orbital period must be such that the first planet doesn't move too far during the time it takes the second to orbit.

I think I remember something about synodic periods. Oh right, the synodic period is the time between similar configurations (like transits) as seen from Earth. But wait, maybe that's not exactly it here. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of their orbital periods affects whether they can align for both events.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the orbital period of the second planet must be less than or equal to the first planet's period multiplied by some factor. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no. Let me think. For a planet to be able to transit, it must pass in front of the star. For it to occult, it must pass behind. But how does that relate to orbital periods?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Hill sphere or something about orbital stability, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the transit and occultation events happen when the planets are aligned along the same line of sight. So, for the second planet to transit, it must be in the same orbital plane as the first planet, which it is. But the timing is crucial. The orbital period of the second planet must be such that, during its orbit, the first planet is in the right position.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relative speeds. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period P2 of the second planet is when its orbital period is such that the first planet takes exactly the same time to orbit, meaning P2 = P1. But that can't be right because the second planet is bigger. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, wait. The key is the timing of the events. For both transits and occultations to happen, the second planet must orbit in such a way that the first planet is in the correct position relative to it. So perhaps the orbital periods must be in a ratio that allows these alignments.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should use the concept of orbital periods and the star's size. The planet must be close enough for the first planet to move into the star's disk before the second planet completes an orbit, or something like that.

Wait, no. Let me think about the relative orbital periods. Suppose the first planet (P1) has a period of P1=3 days, and
