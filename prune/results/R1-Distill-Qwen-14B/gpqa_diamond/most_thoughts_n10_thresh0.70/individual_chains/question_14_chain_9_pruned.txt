Okay, so I've got this ChIP-seq question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about ChIP-seq and the steps involved.

ChIP-seq is a method used to determine the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. The process usually involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, using an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the attached DNA, and then sequencing those DNA fragments to find where the protein binds.

The question talks about using PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation followed by DSG (dithiothreitol) in another condition. Wait, I remember that PFA is a common crosslinker for ChIP. It's usually used to fix the protein-DNA interactions in place. But then there's something about DSG. Oh right! DSG is a reducing agent. It's often used after crosslinking to remove disulfide bonds, which might interfere with the antibody binding during the ChIP process. So when they mention PFA+DSG, that's probably the standard procedure, whereas the initial experiment only used PFA.

The problem says that when using PFA fixed samples, they get ChIP peaks, but those peaks disappear when PFA+DSG is used. So why would adding DSG cause some peaks to vanish?

Hmm, maybe the peaks that disappeared were in regions that are harder to shear or that DSG affects. Wait, another thought. DSG is used to reduce disulfide bonds, so it might help in breaking crosslinks more efficiently. Or perhaps it's about the efficiency of the crosslinking.

Wait, I think I remember that PFA primarily crosslinks proteins to DNA through their amino groups. But there are other crosslinkers like formaldehyde, which is similar. DSG comes into play after the crosslinkingâ€”so it's part of the crosslink reversal process. Oh wait, no, DSG is used before the actual crosslink reversal. Let me think. 

In the ChIP protocol, after crosslinking with PFA, the cells are usually lysed, and then the DNA is sheared. But before that, sometimes they use a treatment like DSG to reduce any disulfide bonds that might be present in the proteins, which could interfere with the antibody binding. So DSG is included during the lysis and shearing steps to maximize the accessibility
