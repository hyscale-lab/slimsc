Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. They're asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. It's in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, right? So when neutral hydrogen absorbs light at that wavelength, it must be causing some kind of absorption line.

Redshift is a big concept here. So when an object is moving away from us, the light it emits or absorbs gets redshifted. The formula for redshift is z = λ_observed / λ_rest - 1. So that's the basic idea.

In this case, the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar. So the hydrogen absorbs at a certain wavelength, which depends on the redshift.

But wait, the question is about detecting these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes typically observe in the visible spectrum, which is about 400-700 nm, or 4000-7000 Angstroms. So if the absorbed wavelength (because of redshift) falls into the optical range, we can detect it. But if the wavelength is still in the UV, ground-based telescopes can't see it because Earth's atmosphere blocks UV light.

So the key here is to find the redshift where the Lyman alpha absorption line moves from the UV to the optical. Let's calculate that.

The Lyman alpha rest wavelength is ~1216 Angstroms, so for it to be observed in the optical, we need λ_obs >= 4000 Angstroms, since that's the lower end of optical range. Wait, no, optical is from about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) up to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So the observed wavelength needs to be at least 4000 Angstroms for ground-based telescopes to detect it.

So the formula is z = λ_obs / λ_rest - 1.

We want the minimum z where λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms. Because any higher z would make the wavelength longer (still in optical), so we can detect it. The lower limit is when it's just entering the optical range.

So plugging in the numbers: λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms, λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms.

z = 4000 / 1216 - 1.

Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 * 3 is 3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216 is about 0.289. So total is 3.289 approximately. So z ≈ 3.29.

Wait, but the options don't have 3.29. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. So the lower limit would be when the wavelength just reaches the optical. So the minimal redshift is 3.29. But the available options are A)3, which is lower than 3.29. Wait, but wait a second. Because if z is 3, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(3+1)=4864 Angstroms, which is 486.4 nm, which is blue-green, visible to optical telescopes.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me redo it.

Wait, the formula is z = (λ_obs - λ_rest)/λ_rest = λ_obs/λ_rest -1.

So when λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms, z = 4000/1216 -1. Let me compute 4000 /1216.

1216 * 3 = 3648. 3648 is less than 4000. 1216 * 3.3 is 1216*3=3648, plus 1216*0.3=364.8 → 3648+364.8=4012.8. That's a bit over 4000. So 3.3 gives 4012.8, which is a little over 4000. So 3.3 would make λ_obs=4012.8 Angstroms, which is just into the optical.

But 3.3 is higher than option A, which is 3. So if the redshift is 3, λ_obs is 1216*(3+1) = 4864 Angstroms. Which is 486.4 nm, which is in the visible (blue-green). So that's definitely in the optical. So for the clouds to be detected, their redshift must be such that the absorption line is in the optical. So the minimal redshift is when the absorption line is just at the start of the optical range, 4000 Angstroms.

Let me compute z when λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms. So z = (4000 / 1216) -1 ≈ (3.292) -1 = 2.292. So approximately 2.29. So the redshift needs to be at least about 2.29.

Wait, because if the redshift is less than 2.29, the observed wavelength would be less than 4000, which is still in the UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see.

So the lower limit on redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher options are C)2.4 and D)1.9.

Wait, 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9? No, 2.29 is lower than 2.4 and higher than 1.9. So which one is the lower limit?

Wait, the lower limit is the minimal redshift that allows detection. So any redshift above 2.29 would be detected. But the question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z where detection is possible.

Thus, the minimal z is about 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the answer would be the smallest z that is equal or larger than 2.29.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29.

Wait, but if the redshift is 1.9, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1.9+1) = 1216 * 2.9 = let's compute that.

1216 *2=2432, 1216*0.9=1094.4 → 2432+1094.4=3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.64 nm, which is UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see it. So redshift needs to be higher than 2.29 to be in optical.

So the minimal redshift is 2.29, so option C is 2.4, which is higher than that. So the lower limit would be 2.29, but since the options don't have that, the minimal available higher option is C)2.4.

Hmm, but wait, I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because perhaps the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 A in the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud. So the quasar emits light, and the cloud absorbs at 1216 A in its own frame, but the observed wavelength would be longer (shifted) depending on the cloud's redshift.

Wait, but the quasar is behind the cloud, so the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. Because the cloud is in front. Wait, no: the cloud is between us and the quasar, so the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the cloud is closer to us.

So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So if the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, and the quasar is at z_quasar, then z_quasar > z_cloud.

So the quasar's light is at higher redshift than the cloud. So the Lyman alpha absorption line of the cloud would be at a wavelength λ_cloud = 1216*(1+z_cloud).

But the quasar's own emission lines, like Lyman alpha, would be at λ_quasar = 1216*(1+z_quasar).

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the absorption line from the cloud appearing in the observed spectrum of the quasar. So the cloud is at a certain redshift, and the quasar is at a higher redshift.

But wait, no, the cloud is in front of the quasar, so it's at a lower redshift. Because the quasar is further away. So the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The quasar is a bright object, and the hydrogen cloud is in front of it. So the quasar's light passes through the cloud and then reaches us. So the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's, because it's closer to us.

So the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, the quasar at z_quasar. So z_quasar > z_cloud.

The Lyman alpha absorption line in the cloud's frame is at 1216 A. So, in our observed frame, it's at 1216*(1 + z_cloud).

The quasar's emitted light, say its own Lyman alpha emission, is at 1216 A, but when observed, it's at 1216*(1 + z_quasar).

But the absorption line from the cloud is therefore at a wavelength 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's spectrum. So when we observe the quasar, we see this line at that wavelength.

So the question is, what is the minimal z_cloud such that the absorption line is in the optical range. Because if the absorption line is in the optical, ground-based telescopes can detect it, but if it's in UV, they can't.

Wait, the quasar's light is at a higher redshift, but the cloud's absorption line is at a lower redshift than the quasar's. So for us to see the absorption line, it must be in the optical.

So the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical range, which starts at about 4000 A (400 nm).

So the minimal z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) = 4000.

Solving for z_cloud:

z_cloud = (4000 / 1216) - 1.

Let me compute that:

4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.2908. Subtract 1 → z ≈ 2.2908.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. Therefore, the cloud must have a redshift of at least about 2.29 for the absorption line to be in the optical.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C)2.4. So the lower limit would be 2.29, so any z_cloud ≥ 2.29 would have the absorption line in optical. So the minimal z is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is the next available option, which is C)2.4.

Wait, but wait, could the quasar's redshift be higher? Because the cloud is in front of it. The quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. So for the cloud's absorption line to be in optical, the cloud's z needs to be at least 2.29. The quasar's z would then be higher than that.

But the question is about the cloud's redshift. So the lower limit on the cloud's redshift is about 2.29, so the clouds must have z >= 2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29, and any option higher than that is acceptable.

The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9, but 2.4 is higher, 1.9 is lower. So the correct answer would be option C)2.4, because it's the minimal z in the options that is higher than 2.29.

Wait, but wait, no. The question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z that allows detection is 2.29. So any cloud with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29. But the options don't have that. So we have to choose the option that is the minimal one that is equal or higher than 2.29.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the correct answer must be C)2.4.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the quasar's redshift. No, the question says "the lower limit on the redshift of this objects"—the objects in question are the clouds of hydrogen, which are at lower redshifts than the quasars.

Wait, no, the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects"—maybe I misread. The objects in question are the clouds, because they are the ones causing the absorption. So the redshift refers to the clouds.

So if their redshift is z_cloud >= 2.29, then the absorption line is in the optical.

So the minimal z_cloud is about 2.29. So the possible answers are C)2.4 and D)1.9.

Since 2.29 is higher than 1.9 and lower than 2.4, the minimal option provided that is higher than 2.29 is C)2.4.

Thus, the correct answer is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Calculating 1216 * (1 + z) = 4000.

z = (4000/1216) -1.

4000 / 1216 is approximately 3.29. So 3.29 -1 = 2.29.

Yes, that's correct. So to get into the optical, the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the answer must be the option just above that. The options are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). So C)2.4 is the answer.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line is detectable by optical ground-based telescopes, we start by noting that the Lyman alpha rest wavelength is approximately \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \). Optical ground-based telescopes observe wavelengths in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \). Therefore, the absorption line must be redshifted into this range for detection.

The redshift \( z \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

To find the lower limit on \( z \), we set \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \), the lower bound of the optical range. Substituting the values:

\[
z = \frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift \( z \) required for the Lyman alpha absorption line to enter the optical range is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \).

Next, we compare this result with the provided options:
- **A) 3**: This is higher than \( 2.29 \), so it is valid but not the minimal value.
- **B) 1.2**: This is lower than \( 2.29 \), so it is invalid as the absorption line would still be in the ultraviolet.
- **C) 2.4**: This is higher than \( 2.29 \), making it a valid option and the closest to the calculated lower limit.
- **D) 1.9**: This is lower than \( 2.29 \), so it is invalid.

The correct answer is the smallest option greater than or equal to \( 2.29 \), which is **C) 2.4**.
