Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's read the question carefully and figure out what's going on. 

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

The initial state is 1S0, which means it has a total spin S=0 (since S=0 implies singlet state). The L is 0 because it's S state, and the J is 0. So the initial state has J=0, L=0, S=0.

In the final state, the NN has T=0. So the problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted, based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The options are A to D, each showing an initial state (1S0) emitting a particle (p, p, f, s) to a certain state. The lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. So for each option, the emitted particle has a specific l value.

Let me think about the steps needed. I think I need to look at each option, figure out the possible angular momentum and parity, and see which one violates the conservation laws.

First, the initial state is 1S0. So the initial angular momentum J_initial is 0, because J = L + S? Wait, no. Wait, for a bound system, J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of orbital angular momentum (L) and spin (S). But for the initial state, it's 1S0. So in spectroscopic notation, 1S0 is (2S+1)L(S)J. Wait, no, the notation is (2S+1)L^J, right? Or is it (2S+1)L(J)? Like, for 1S0, S is 0, so 2S+1=1. L is 0 (since S state). And J is 0. So initial state: J=0, L=0, S=0.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, the final state of the NN system must obey certain quantum numbers. Let's consider the process:

The initial state is 1S0. Then, it emits X, so the final NN state will have some T, L', S'. Wait, but T is given as 0. So T(NN) =0.

The Pauli condition (given) is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Let's plug in T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which means S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. So if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

But wait, the NN state's S and L are part of their total angular momentum. So for the NN system, their combined spin is S' (could be different from initial S=0?), and orbital angular momentum L'. Hmm, but wait, the initial state has S=0 and L=0. After emission, the NN state could have different S' and L' depending on the process.

Wait, but the emission of a particle would involve angular momentum considerations. Let me think about the process as a decay or emission.

The total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J is 0. The final state (NN) has J' = L' + S'. The emitted particle X has its own angular momentum l, and its spin s. But wait, the angular momentum carried away by X is part of the total angular momentum.

Wait, but the problem is
