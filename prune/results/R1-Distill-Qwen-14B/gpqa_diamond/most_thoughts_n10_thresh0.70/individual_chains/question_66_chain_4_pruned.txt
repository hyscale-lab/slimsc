Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators in it must respect. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must obey.

The options given are symmetries 1 to 4, and the possible answers are combinations A to D. Let me break down each symmetry.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I think this is definitely one because all the operators in the Standard Model are Lorentz invariant. Effective theories usually preserve the same symmetries as the original theory. So SMEFT operators should respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is a must.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if an operator is Lorentz invariant, does it automatically have to respect Poincare? I'm not so sure. Wait, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since the SMEFT is a field theory, it should be local and hence respect Poincare. Because if it didn't respect translations, the terms would not be Lorentz-invariant unless they have derivatives, but SMEFT includes operators of different dimensions. So I think Poincare is also a symmetry that must be respected. So option 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: I'm a bit fuzzy here. I remember that the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric due to things like the CKM matrix and the Higgs potential. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT shouldn't enforce it either. Because SMEFT includes all possible higher-dimension operators, including those that might violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. Thus, 3 might not be a must.

4. CPT symmetry: Wait, CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory. TheColeman-Mandula theorem, or more accurately, all renormalizable theories and effective theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because it's a basic tenet of QFT. So I think SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is a must.

So putting it together:

- Must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). Also, Poincare (2) because it's part of the field theory setup. So which options have 1,2, and 4?

Looking back at the
