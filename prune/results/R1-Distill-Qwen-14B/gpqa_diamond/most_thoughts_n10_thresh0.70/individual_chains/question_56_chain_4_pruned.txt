Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, transitions happen between different energy levels, and dipole transitions have specific selection rules. Right, the selection rules for dipole transitions are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, the parity also has to change, because dipole transitions require a change in parity. Oh wait, the parity is (-1)^l, so if the initial and final states have opposite parity, the transition is allowed.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. Its l is 0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, l=0, parity +1. Wait, that's the same parity. Oh, but wait, no, because the initial state is n=3, l=0, and the final is n=1, l=0. So the parity didn't change. Hmm, that can't be right because dipole transitions require a change in parity, because the dipole operator is a vector (so it's odd parity). So the transition from l=0 to l=0 wouldn't be allowed. Wait, but the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions. So maybe it's allowed via two steps? Because each dipole transition would change the parity, but doing two steps would bring it back.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing things. Let me think again. So the initial state is n=3, l=0. So the parity is +1 as I said. To go to n=1, l=0, same parity. So a direct transition from l=0 to l=0 would not be allowed because the parity is the same; that would require even parity transition, which dipole doesn't allow. So perhaps the decay is via an intermediate state that changes the parity.

So the process would be |3,0,0⟩ → some state with l=1 (Δl=±1), then from there → |1,0,0⟩. Because each step changes the parity, so two steps would bring it back to same parity.

So the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ would have to go to a state with l=1. Because l can only change by ±1, so from l=0 to l=1.

So the possible intermediates for the first step are states with n=2 (since n must be higher or lower by 1? No, wait, n can change by any number, as long as l changes by ±1. Wait, the selection rules for hydrogen are: Δn can be any except 0, and Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1.

Wait, no, the selection rules are Δl = ±1, but Δn can
