Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of steps.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, ethan-1-one is acetophenone, right? So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3) attached, and substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Specifically, at position 3 there's a bromine and at position 5 a nitro group. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the numbering on the benzene ring can be a bit tricky. Let me think: if the ketone is at position 1, then the substituents are at 3 and 5. So the ring has three substituents: the ketone (COCH3) at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. So it's meta to each other.

Wait, no, actually, in benzene rings, substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So if the ketone is at position 1, then Br is at 3 and nitro at 5. But wait, wait, let me draw this out mentally. The ring has the ketone group attached to position 1. Then, moving clockwise, position 2, 3 (Br), 4, 5 (NO2), 6. So it's 3-bromo and 5-nitro.

But wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is in position 1, and substituents at 3 and 5. That makes sense. So the benzene ring has three substituents: COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5.

Now, starting from benzene, I need to add these groups. But the order in which I add them is crucial because of the directing effects of the substituents
