Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm. Let me think about what I know. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the index of refraction. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and n is the refractive index of the medium.

But wait, the glass is moving here. So the question is about the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. Oh, because the glass is moving towards the observer. I'm a bit fuzzy on how relative motion affects the speed of light. I think in special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, but wait, this problem doesn't mention relativity, so maybe it's a classical mechanics approach. Or perhaps it's expecting me to use a certain approximation.

Let me read the problem again. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving through the glass, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. So in the glass, without any movement, the light would be moving at c/n. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

I think in the classical approach, velocities add linearly. Like, if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light inside is moving at v_glass = c/n relative to the glass, then relative to the lab, the speed would be v_glass + v. But wait, that might not be correct because the light's direction depends on where the glass is moving.

Wait, no. If the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, then the light's speed in the lab frame would be (c/n) + v. But wait, that would make sense if the light and the glass are moving in the same direction. Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the directions wrong.

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the beam's speed relative to the lab would be the speed of light in the glass plus the speed of the glass itself? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, but in reality, according to special relativity, the speed of light can't exceed c, and it's always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether to use relativity here. It just says it's a light beam propagating through a glass moving at velocity v.

Wait, but the options given don't have any terms with c. Oh wait, the problem says to take c=1. So the speed of light in a vacuum is 1.

Wait, so if the glass is moving, would that affect the observed speed? In classical physics, perhaps the speed is c/n + v, but then that could be greater than c, which isn't possible under relativity. But since the options don't have any terms with c, perhaps it's expecting a classical approach.

Wait, but the problem says, 'what is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.'
