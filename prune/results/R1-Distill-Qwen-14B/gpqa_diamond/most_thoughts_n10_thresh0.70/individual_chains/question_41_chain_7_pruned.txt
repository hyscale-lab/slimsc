Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving relative to an observer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says a light beam is going through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about how the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames, right? Oh, that's from Einstein's postulate of special relativity. So no matter the motion of the source or the medium, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c. But wait, in this case, the light is in a medium, glass, which has an index of refraction n.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass would normally be c/n. Because in a medium, the speed is lower. So without any movement, the speed would be c/n. But here, the glass itself is moving. Hmm, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed shouldn't change based on the motion of the source. So whether the glass is moving towards you or not, the light's speed in your frame should still be c, but wait no, because the light is in the glass, which is a medium. So this might get tricky.

Wait, no. In special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that
