Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

So the setup is that we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, right?

Wait, no, the wave function's modulus squared gives the probability density. So if particles aren't found outside 1 < x <3, that means the probability density is zero there. So the wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) -0.5i. Hmm, but that doesn't look like it's zero outside x=1 to 3. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. But the given expression is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That doesn't seem to be zero unless a is adjusted or unless the expression is zero in some way. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the boundary conditions.

Wait a second, maybe the wave function is given only within the region where the particle exists. So the wave function is non-zero between x=1 and
