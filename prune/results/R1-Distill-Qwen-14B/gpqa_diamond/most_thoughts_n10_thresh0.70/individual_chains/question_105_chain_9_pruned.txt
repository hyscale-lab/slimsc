Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how it compares to a hypothetical exoplanet's signal in the light curve. Hmm. So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun, right? And one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. Oh wait, the temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. But the interesting part is that this setup could mimic the presence of an exoplanet when looking at photometric data over time.

The main question is: what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spotted star, assuming the star wasn't spotted?

So, first, I remember that when a planet transits in front of its star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness (the dip) depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because area scales with the square of radius.

But wait, the star has spots that affect the brightness too. So the star's brightness varies as it rotates, bringing spots into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the maximum reduction in brightness would be when all the spots are facing us. Oh, but wait, the spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the star's overall brightness dips a bit.

Wait, but the question says that the observed brightness variation is similar to that of a planet, so we need to find the equivalent planet radius that causes the same dip.

Let me think about the star's brightness variation first. The star's brightness is affected by the spots. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the hemisphere is covered. But wait, one hemisphere is entirely covered? Or each spot covers 20% of that hemisphere? Oh, the filling factor typically refers to the fraction of the surface covered. So if the filling factor is 20%, that's 0.2 of the star's surface covered by spots.

But the star's total brightness is the sum of the bright and dark parts. So the effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 5000K (since the difference is 10
