Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about reaction mechanisms, which I find a bit tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B, and I have to choose the correct major products from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for both A and B. I need to figure out each reaction separately, probably using some reaction mechanisms I've learned.

Starting with Reaction A:
The reactants are 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base. Hmm, okay. So I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which often leads to elimination reactions rather than substitution. Also, ethyl acrylate is an ester with an acryloyl group—CH₂=CHCOOEt, right? So maybe this is a conjugate addition or some kind of Michael addition?

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone, cyclohexanone derivative. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexane ring has substituents at positions 1 (the ketone), 2 (ethyl), and 6 (methyl). Wait, no, wait—the numbering. Wait, position 1 is the ketone, so the ring is cyclohexan-1-one. At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and position 6 is a methyl? Or wait, 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl), and another methyl at position 2 as well? Wait, 2,6-dimethyl—so positions 2 and 6 each have a methyl,
