Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, what do I remember about synchrocyclotrons? Oh right, they're a type of cyclotron used for accelerating particles to high energies. Unlike the classical cyclotron, the synchrocyclotron has a magnetic field that varies with time, allowing it to handle particles with varying velocities as they gain energy.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, and it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. We need to find how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. So, the proton is accelerated by the voltage in the synchrocyclotron. Each time it goes around the orbit, it gains some energy from the electric field, right? But because the magnetic field is changing, the cyclotron frequency isn't constant. Oh, but wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the proton gains energy, which allows it to stay in resonance with the accelerating frequency.

But wait, the problem mentions the alternating voltage. So the voltage is varying sinusoidally. The key is probably to find out how much energy the proton gains each time it makes a revolution, and then find out how many such steps are needed to reach 950 MeV.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact process. Let me think. The voltage U(t) is the electric potential difference applied. The work done on the proton each time it goes around the orbit is the integral of the electric field over the displacement. But since the electric field is perpendicular to the velocity (as it's providing centripetal force), the work done is only when the proton crosses the gap between the D-shaped electrodes. Oh, right, in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied across the gap, and the protons are accelerated each time they pass through that gap.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant. So the cyclotron frequency changes as
