Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, the standard notation is |n, l, m⟩, right? So n is the principal quantum number, l the azimuthal or angular momentum, and m the magnetic quantum number.

Dipole transitions have specific selection rules. I think for electric dipole transitions, the change in l (denoted Δl) is ±1. Oh right, for an allowed dipole transition, l must change by ±1. Because the dipole operator has components proportional to r^2 Y_{1, m} (maybe?), so it can only cause transitions where l changes by 1.

So starting from n=3, l=0. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. To go to |1,0,0⟩, which is n=1, l=0.

But wait, the initial l is 0. So for a dipole transition, the next l has to be 0 ±1, so either l=1 or l=-1, but since l can't be negative, so l=1.

So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1, so the intermediate state would have l=1. Then, from l=1, you can go to l=0 again because Δl can be ±1. So that's the two-step dipole transition.

So the steps would be |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩, and then |2,1, m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Because each dipole transition must change l by ±1.

Wait, but n has to change as well. So when n goes from 3 to 1, but it's done in two steps. So first, n=3 → n=2, and then n=2 → n=1. Because each transition changes n by ±1, right? Or wait, no. The selection rule for n is that it can change by any integer, but in practice, for dipole transitions, I think the change in n is ±1. Because the dipole operator affects the potential, which is proportional to the electric field, and the matrix elements involve integrals of r, which connects n and n±1 states.

So in the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩, the possible next states are those with n=2 and l=1. Because l must change by +1, from 0 to 1, and n must change by -1, from 3 to 2.

So the intermediate state is |2,1, m⟩. The possible m values? The initial m is 0. The dipole transition allows m to change by 0, ±1. Because the dipole operator has components that can change m by -1, 0, +1.

Wait, the transition for m is Δm = 0, ±1. So the initial state is m=0. So the possible m after the first transition can be -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

Then, in the second transition, from |2,1, m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. So again, l must change by -1 (from 1 to 0). And n changes by -1 (from 2 to 1).

For the m value, since the initial m in the second transition is, say, m1, then the final m must be m1 ±1 or same? Wait, no, in the second transition, m can change by 0, ±1 again. But the final state is m=0.

So for the second transition, starting from m1 (either -1, 0, or +1 in the intermediate state), it needs to reach m=0.

So let me think about each possible intermediate state.

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩.

Then, in the second transition, m must go from 0 to 0. So Δm=0. That's allowed.

Case 2: Intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩.

Then, m must go from 1 to 0. So Δm= -1. That's allowed.

Case 3: Intermediate state is |2,1,-1⟩.

m must go from -1 to 0. So Δm= +1. Also allowed.

So each of these intermediate states is possible.

Now, the question is about the transition routes and their probabilities. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the options, I see options A, B, C, D.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 then 2,1,1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1 then 1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: 3→2,1,0 then 1,0,0. Probability 2/3.

Wait, but the problem says it's two dipole transitions. So each step is a dipole transition. So the overall transition is a two-step process.

Now, the given options are about the route and the corresponding probability. So the probability is the product of the probabilities of each transition, or perhaps the sum, but I think it's more likely the product.

Wait, no. Wait, each transition is a selection, so the probability would be the product
