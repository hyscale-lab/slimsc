Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

So the question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope in one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's break it down. First, I'll try to figure out what Substance X is. Since it's used in organic reactions and reacts with something to release a gas, maybe it's something like a strong base or a metal. Wait, it's a reagent, maybe like a Grignard reagent? Those are organometallic compounds, like Mg-based. Or maybe something else.

Wait, the reaction is violent with liquid Y. Common violent reactions could be metals reacting with acids. For example, magnesium reacts with concentrated hydrochloric acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe sodium reacting with water. Oh, but then Y is a liquid. If Y is water, then X could be a metal like Na, K, or something else. But sodium reacts with water violently, releasing H2 gas. Let's see.

Gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule has same number of p and n. Let's think, for example, H2O has 8 neutrons in O, but that's more than protons. Wait, the molecule as a whole. Oh wait, wait a second. The molecule of gas W has same number of neutrons and protons in total. So for example, H2 has 2 H atoms: each has 1 p and 0 n. So total p = 2, n=0. Not equal. So that's not it. What else?

Wait, maybe it's NH3? No, because NH3 is a gas, but it's a molecule. Let's see the sum of protons and neutrons. NH3: N has 7 p, 8 n? Wait, wait, each atom in the molecule contributes. So N has 7 p and 8 n? Or depends on isotopes. Alternatively, maybe the molecule in question is something else.

Wait another approach: if the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, perhaps the molecule
