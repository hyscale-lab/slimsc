Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, what's happening in the reaction? X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W. W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the protons. So the gas is probably something like CO2 (but wait, that's 12 neutrons and 12 protons for carbon?), wait no, wait. Wait, the gas's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think, for example, water has H2O, but that's H and O. No, wait, for the molecule as a whole. Oh wait, no, perhaps the molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe W is something like H2O wouldn't because H has 1 proton, O has 8. So the molecule as a whole would have 2 H (each with 1p) and 1 O (8p), so 2+8=10 protons, but the number of neutrons would be for each atomâ€”each H has 0 neutrons (assuming protium), O has 8 neutrons (since O is 16, 8 protons so 8 neutrons). So total neutrons would be 0*2 +8 =8, but protons are 2 +8 =10. Not equal.

Wait, perhaps W is CH4? No, but wait, the molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons in total. Let's think about possible gases. Maybe something like NH3? No,
