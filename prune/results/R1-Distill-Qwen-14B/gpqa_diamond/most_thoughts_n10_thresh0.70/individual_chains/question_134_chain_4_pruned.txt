Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are given. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they undergo neutralization reactions. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Oh wait, but in this case, there are multiple acids and a base. I need to figure out the stoichiometry here.

First, maybe I should find out how many moles of each reactant are present. Moles are calculated by concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). Let me jot that down.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. So, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. Neutralization is between H+ and OH-. The total H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. Let me sum them up. HCl gives 0.1, H2SO4 gives 0.18, so total H+ is 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this reaction is known, right? I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), but wait, I'm not sure if it's per mole of H+ or per mole of acid. Oh right, for strong acids and bases, it's around -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

So I need to find out which is the limiting reactant here. The H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reactant since it's less. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole of OH- neutralizes a mole of H+.

So 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+. The remaining H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

But wait, what about the excess H+? Does that affect the total heat released? Because the enthalpy change is per mole of reaction. So regardless of how much is left, the heat released is based on the moles that reacted.

So the total moles of H+ that react is 0.2, so the heat released would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ. Wait, but wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Oh, I need to check the options.

The options are:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.46 kJ converted to kcal. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So
