Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l = 1. The problem states that the coupled angular momentum state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is given as |l1, l2, l, m>, which is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that's interesting because I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, the total angular momentum l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. So here, l1 and l2 are both 1, so the possible total l's are 0, 1, 2. So the state is for l=2 and m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. I need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -침.

Hmm, okay. So each electron has orbital angular momentum L1 and L2. The eigenvalue for L1z is m1 * 침, and similarly for L2z, it's m2 * 침. But in this case, the problem says the eigenvalues are -침 each, so m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, but in the state, the total m is -1
