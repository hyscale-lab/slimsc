Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and think through how to solve it. Hmm. The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, let me understand what's being asked. The problem is about the minimum resolution required. I think resolution here refers to the detector's ability to distinguish between particles, perhaps in terms of distance. So, if the particles decay too far apart, the detector needs to be able to resolve that distance to see the decay products as separate events.

But wait, no. Wait, in particle physics experiments, when a particle decays, the decay products (Y⁺ and Z⁻) fly apart. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of X⁰. But because the particle is moving, the lifetime we observe is longer due to time dilation.

Wait, right. The lifetime τ observed in the lab frame is longer than τ₀ because of the Lorentz factor gamma. So the particles Y and Z will travel some distance before they decay, but in this case, I think X⁰ is the one decaying, and the products are Y and Z. Wait, no, X⁰ is the particle that decays, so it's moving, and the decay products are moving as well. So the distance between the decay point and the products would depend on their speed and the lifetime.

Wait, no, actually, the decay of X⁰ happens, and then Y and Z move away from each other. The distance between them when they're created depends on the speed and the lifetime. So the minimum resolution probably refers to the ability to resolve the two decay products as separate, which depends on their separation.

So, the question is, what's the minimum distance between Y and Z such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Hmm, maybe the resolution is the distance the particles travel before the chamber can detect them. So, if the separation is too small, the detector can't distinguish them as separate particles, so the decay would appear as a single track, not two. So, we need the distance between Y and Z to be at least the detector's resolution to see them separately. So, the minimum resolution would be the average distance they travel before the detector can register them as separate.

Wait, but no, the question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps we're looking for the distance where 30% of the decays have separation greater than this distance, meaning that the detector can resolve those. Or maybe it's the threshold where 30% are resolved. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Let me think about the formula. The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame would be longer than the proper lifetime. The proper lifetime is τ₀, and the lab lifetime τ is given by τ = γ τ₀, where gamma is
