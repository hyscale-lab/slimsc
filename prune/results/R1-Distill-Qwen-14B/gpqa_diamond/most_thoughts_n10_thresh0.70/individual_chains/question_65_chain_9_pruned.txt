Alright, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, okay, the question has two parts, reactions A and B, and we need to determine the major products from each. The options are given as combinations, so I need to figure out each reaction separately and then match them to the options.

Starting with reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ at the end suggests protonation. So, what happens when a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH? Oh right, this sounds like a deprotonation followed by elimination, maybe a Cope elimination or some kind of cyclization.

Looking at the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atomâ€”here, the spiro atom is the one with the hydroxyl group. The structure has a five-membered ring (from non-5-en-1-ol) and a seven-membered ring? Wait, wait, the spiro is [3.5], which means the two rings have 3 and 5 carbons each, right? So the main chain is non-5-en, which is nine carbons, but split into rings?

When treated with a strong base, the hydroxyl group (which is acidic) gets deprotonated. Then, maybe an elimination occurs. But wait, the structure also has a vinyl group. So perhaps after deprotonation, the base abstracts a proton, leading to an E2 elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but this is a bicyclic or polycyclic structure. So maybe the base induces some kind of ring-forming elimination. Like, an E2 mechanism where the leaving group (like OH-) is removed along with a proton from a position that allows the formation of a new double bond and a ring.

Alternatively, since it's a spiro alcohol, perhaps a pinacol-type rearrangement? Wait, no, pinacol rearrangement is for 1,2-diols. But here, it's a spiro alcohol, so maybe it undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Wait, another thought: when a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, it can lead to the formation of a bicyclic ketone via elimination. Because the spiro structure can lose a water molecule (but wait, in this case, it's not a diol, so maybe not pinacol), but perhaps the base abstracts a proton, and the OH leaves as a leaving group, but wait, OH isn't a good leaving group. Unless deprotonated to O-.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is a conjugate elimination. If you have a spiro alcohol with a conjugated double bond, heating with a base can induce an
