Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system involving charges. Hmm, let me try to understand the setup.

So, the system has 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. But wait, 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. Oh, so the 13th is at the center, and the others are arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. I'm a bit rusty on potential energy calculations, but I think this involves calculating the electrostatic potential energy between all the pairs of charges.

Since all the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from P, and the 13th is at P, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th. So the energy between each of these 12 and the central charge is... let me think. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Oh right, Coulomb's law for potential energy.

So each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central one is 2e as well. So each pair contributes U = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (2e * 2e) / (2 meters). Wait, but e is 1.602e-19 coulombs. So let me compute that.

Wait, but wait a second. Each of the 12 charges is 2e, so let me write that down. Each contributes 2e, so q1 and q2 are both 2e.

So for each pair, U would be k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). Let me compute that.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at the same point, but wait, if they are identical and at the same distance from P, but are they arranged in some way that affects their mutual potential energy? Because if all 12 are at the same point, that's not possible due to their repulsion, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 meters. So perhaps each of the 12 is at a point 2 meters from P, but their exact positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, but for the minimum energy, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized. Wait, but since they are all like charges, their mutual potential energy would be repulsive, so maybe placing them as close as possible to each other would lower the potential energy? Or wait, no, because the potential energy between two positive charges is positive, so bringing them together would increase the potential energy. Oh wait, but wait, no, the potential energy is positive when the charges are like. So when you bring them closer, the potential energy increases. So if the system is isolated, the charges will arrange themselves to minimize the potential energy. But in this case, they are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. But wait, the problem might be that each of the 12 is at a fixed distance from
