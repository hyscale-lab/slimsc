Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the probability of measuring a certain observable P and getting 0. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but usually in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors. I wonder if I need to normalize this first. Let me calculate the norm. The components squared are 1, 4, and 1, so the sum is 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ) when normalized. I should probably use this normalized vector for my calculations.

Next, the observable P is given as a matrix. Let me write it down. The first row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row is 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row is 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. So P looks like this:

[ 0         1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2      0         1/√2 ]
[ 0         1/√2      0     ]

Wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators. I should check if P is Hermitian. To be Hermitian, the matrix must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me transpose P and see.

The transpose of P would have first column as 0,1/√2, 0; second column as 1/√2, 0,1/√2; third column as 0,1/√2,0. Comparing to the original P, the second row had 1/√2, 0, 1/√2. So when transposed, the second column becomes the middle element and the entries around it. Wait, I think P is symmetric, so its transpose is equal to P. So yes, P is Hermitian. Good, that makes sense for an observable.

Now, the eigenvalues of P are the possible outcomes of the measurement. The question
