Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember from my studies that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. So, the astronaut's own experienced time, or proper time, would be less than the time observed from Earth. 

The civilization is in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they're sending a spacecraft towards Earth. The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Wow, that's really close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their point of view to reach Earth. 

Wait, but first, how far away is the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth? I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me approximate that. Let's say it's 170,000 light-years on average. So, the distance d is 170,000 light-years. 

But wait, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. So, the time from Earth's frame (Earth time) would be distance divided by speed. Let me calculate that. 

Time in Earth frame, T = d / v. Where d is 170,000 light-years and v is 0.99999987c. Since 1 light-year per year is c, the units will work out. So T = 170,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 170,000 / 1 (since 0.99999987 is almost 1, but just slightly less. Wait, 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013 because 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x. So maybe the time would be about 170,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 170,000 + (170,000
