Alright, so I have this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, okay, I remember that nucleophilicity depends on the solvent and the basicity of the nucleophile. The question gives me five nucleophiles and asks me to arrange them from most reactive to least reactive.

Let me list the nucleophiles again:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS-)

Wait, wait. Methanol is CH3OH, but it's a nucleophile? Oh, but methanol is a weak nucleophile because it's not a strong base. In aqueous solution, nucleophilicity is often about how strong a base the nucleophile is because in a protic solvent, stronger bases are better nucleophiles. Or wait, no. Wait, in protic solvents (like water), the situation is different because the nucleophile can be solvated. So in a protic solvent, the ability to donate electrons is less about basicity because the solvent can stabilize the negative charge.

Wait, but in a polar protic solvent, the nucleophilicity tends to be inversely related to basicity because the more basic a nucleophile is, the more it's solvated, which hinders its nucleophilic attack. So less basic nucleophiles are better nucleophiles in protic solvents? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. For example, in a protic solvent like water or alcohol, the more polarizable the nucleophile, the better it is. Also, the solvent stabilizes the charge, so the solvation effect is significant.

So in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is often different from their basicity. For example, in a protic solvent, the thiolate ion (HS-) is a better nucleophile than hydroxide (OH-), because the thiolate is less solvated due to weaker charge or larger size? Wait, but HS- is a stronger base than OH-? No, no. Wait, actually, thiolate is a stronger base. Because
