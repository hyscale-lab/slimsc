Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that when the star rotates, these spots come into view and change the brightness we observe, which can look like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The question is, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation as these spots do?

Hmm, right, I remember that starspots can cause dips in brightness when they rotate into view. But in this case, they're asking about what an exoplanet's radius would need to be to produce the same dip. So, the key is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

First, let me think about how the brightness variation is calculated. For a star without spots, if a planet transits, the drop in brightness is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Because when the planet blocks some starlight, the observed flux decreases by that area fraction. So the formula for the relative change in brightness (delta F) is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the situation might be a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the star's total brightness drops because the spots are emitting less light. But since the spots are only on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, they come into view and then go out of view, causing periodic dips.

Wait, but the question says that the observed photometric variations would resemble an exoplanet. So to find the equivalent planet radius, we need to compute the equivalent area that's causing the dip, which would be the area blocked by the planet.

So, let's first figure out the change in brightness due to the spots. The problem mentions a filling factor of 20% for the spots. Filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% of the star's surface is spots. But also, the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So each spot is cooler than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, the star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000. So each spot emits less flux than the surrounding areas.

So the total flux from the star when a spot is facing us would be the normal flux minus the flux from the spot (which is less). But wait, when the star isn't spotted, the flux is higher because all areas are emitting at 6000 K. When a spot is visible, the flux is lower because part of the surface is emitting at 5000 K.

Wait, but the question is about the brightness variation. So the change in brightness when the star is spotted compared to when it's not. Wait no, the problem says that if the star was not covered by spots, what would the exoplanet's radius be to produce the same amplitude.

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me read again.

The question states: To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star?

So, when the star is not spotted, if a planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. But in the spotted case, the star's brightness varies due to the rotation, and the amplitude of that variation is being compared to the planet transit dip.

So, the brightness variation caused by the spots is the difference in flux when spots are visible compared to when they are not. So when the star rotates such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us.

Wait, but the problem says that only one hemisphere
