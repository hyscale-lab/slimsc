Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form 2. Next, 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form 3. Finally, 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

I need to figure this out step by step. Let's break down each reaction.

First step: Product 1 is formed from the starting material and two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI and heat. Hmm. So, the starting material is a bicyclo compound with a tert-butoxy group. The other reactant is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene is norbornene, I think. So that's a norbornene derivative with a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

The other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexene has two substituents, each being a dibromomethyl group, at positions 5 and 6. The structure would be that each of those positions has -CH2Br2 attached.

So when these react with NaI and heat, it sounds like a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Maybe an alkyl bromide is reacting with something. But wait, the starting material has an oxygen group. Tert-butoxy is an ether. So perhaps an elimination or some coupling?

Wait, but the other compound has dibromomethyl groups. So the 5,6 positions have CH2Br2 groups. So each of these is a dibromomethyl group, which is a good leaving group, perhaps.

Wait, NaI is present. Iodide is a good nucleophile. So maybe the dibromomethyl groups undergo some kind of substitution. Or perhaps the norbornene compound is the nucleophile? Or maybe the norbornene is undergoing some addition.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the reaction conditions. High temperature, which suggests perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe a [2+2] cycloaddition? But norbornene is a diene, but the other compound has two dienophile possibilities. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or coupling.
