Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a different reaction. The options are given, and I need to figure out which option correctly assigns the products to each reaction.

Starting with part A: The reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine, but-3-en-2-ol, and H+ with heat. So I'm guessing this is a Cope or Claisen rearrangement, which are sigmatropic. Wait, but wait—Claisen is usually for enol ethers, right? But here we have an amine. Hmm.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine—so that's (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Or maybe it's ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. But wait, the structure is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So the structure is like NH2-C(CH3O)2-CH2... Wait, no, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be (CH3O)2C-CH2NH2? Or maybe it's more like OMe groups on the same carbon as the amine?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3O)2CH-NH2. So that's like ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the adjacent carbon. Hmm. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,1-dimethoxyethylamine. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enamine. Wait, but I'm not sure. So the reaction is with but-3-en-2-ol and H+ and heat. H+ and heat usually suggest acid catalysis, which can lead to enol formation or other rearrangements.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2? Wait, but but-3-en-2-
