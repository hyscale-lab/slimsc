Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT for short. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these, labeled 1 to 4, and the options are A to D.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 8, etc. But the key here is about the symmetries these operators must obey.

Lorentz symmetry is a big one. I think all the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because they are constructed from the fields of the Standard Model, which are Lorentz covariant. So if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz symmetry, it probably wouldn't be part of SMEFT. So point 1 is definitely correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincare symmetry. Operators are local, so they can't violate that. So point 2 must also be respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Then there's CP symmetry. I'm a bit confused here. I know that the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric due to things like the CKM matrix, but does SMEFT respect it? I think the operators in SMEFT can violate CP if the parameters (Wilson coefficients) are complex. For example, the Weinberg operator is a dimension six operator that doesn't violate any of the big symmetries except maybe CP if the coefficient is complex. Wait, but does that mean the operator itself doesn't respect CP? Or is it that the theory as a whole might not respect CP if the coefficients are chosen to be complex? So individual operators might not have to respect CP symmetry on their own. So point 3 is not a must; it's possible for operators to violate CP. So point 3 is not necessarily required.

CPT symmetry is a bit tricky. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement. That is, any Lorentz-invariant QFT must respect CPT. So SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect CPT symmetry. So point 4 is correct.

Putting it all together, which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct combination is 1,2,4.

Looking at the options: option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1 and 2, which misses CPT. Option D includes 1,3,4 which includes CP, which is not necessarily required. So the answer should be option C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed from the fields of the Standard Model and must respect certain symmetries. Here's the analysis of the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because they are constructed from Lorentz-covariant fields. This is a fundamental requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. This is also a necessary condition.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. For example, the Weinberg operator does not violate Lorentz symmetry but can violate CP if the Wilson coefficients are complex. Thus, CP symmetry is not a universal requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, including SMEFT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination is **1, 2, 4**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
