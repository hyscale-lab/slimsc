Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, there are two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2. Also, the mass of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2. The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh wait, Wien's Law! Right, the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T of the star. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star 1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us. But Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Oh wait, but when calculating luminosity, does radial velocity matter? Hmm, maybe not directly because the question says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation, so perhaps the Doppler effect isn't a factor here. Because the observed wavelength might shift due to velocity, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, maybe the observed peak wavelength is the same, which would imply that the intrinsic temperature is the same. Because if Star 2
