Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface (so one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K. 

Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, we'll see changes in brightness as the spots come into and go out of view. These brightness variations will look like a periodic signal in photometric data. The interesting part is that this could mimic the presence of an exoplanet causing the same kind of brightness dip when it transits the star.

The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was a planet transiting the star, what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve? So we need to find R_planet divided by R_star.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2. But wait, in this case, the star isn't just a uniform brightness. Because of the spots, the star's brightness isn't the same across its surface. So the effective brightness change due to the spots will be different than a planet transit.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet..." So I think this means that we need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find what planet radius would cause the same variation without spots.

So the approach is probably: calculate the fractional change in brightness due to the spots and set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet transit, then solve for Rp/Rstar.

Let me think about how to calculate the brightness variation from the spots. Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible side, the star appears dimmer. The change in flux will depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The flux from a star (or spot) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're dealing with relative changes, maybe we can simplify it.

The star's total flux without spots: Let's say the star has a uniform temperature of 6000 K. So its total flux is F_star = σ T_star^4. The spots are cooler, 5000 K, and cover a certain area.

But wait, the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. The area of a hemisphere is (4π R^2)/2 = 2π R^2. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

Wait, but when the star rotates, we only see one hemisphere at a time. So when the spots are on the side facing us, they cover 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that hemisphere is covered in spots.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let's model it as the spots being a fraction f of the star's surface. The star's surface area is 4π R^2. The spotty hemisphere covers half the surface, so 2π R^2. The spots are 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R^2.

Now, the star's total flux when spots are on one side (f
