Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 and l2, both equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Oh wait, wait. So the state is written as |l1, l2, l, m>, where l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. So l is 2 here because l1 + l2 can be 2, 1, or 0. But wait, the coupling is for the total orbital angular momentum, right? Because when you combine two angular momenta, you add their l values. So l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since both l1 and l2 are 1, l can be 0, 1, or 2.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>, so l=2 and m=-1. So the total z-component of angular momentum is m= -1. The problem is about measuring the individual Lz components of each electron, L1z and L2z, and finding the probability that both are -Ä§.

Wait, for each electron, the orbital angular momentum in the z direction
