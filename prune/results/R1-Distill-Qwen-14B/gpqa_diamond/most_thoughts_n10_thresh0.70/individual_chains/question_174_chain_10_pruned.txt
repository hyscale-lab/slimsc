Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about an atomic nucleus undergoing spontaneous fission. So, I remember that fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a lot of energy. The question gives some specifics about the masses and energies, and I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy and the classical approximation.

The initial nucleus has a mass M and is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Wait, rest energy is mc², right? So, M is the rest mass. Then, it splits into two fragments. The more massive fragment is twice as heavy as the other. So if the less massive is, say, x, then the more massive is 2x. Their combined rest mass is 99% of M. So, x + 2x = 0.99 M. That simplifies to 3x = 0.99 M, so x is 0.33 M, right? So the two fragments have masses of 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the initial rest energy is M c² = 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest energy is 0.99 M c² because the sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of M. So the rest energy after is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. That means some mass has been converted into kinetic energy. Because in fission, some mass is lost, which is converted into kinetic energy and other forms like radiation or other particles, but the problem says that only two fragments are produced, so I guess all the missing mass energy goes into their kinetic energy.

So the total energy released would be the initial rest energy minus the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments. So that's 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. So 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy plus any binding energy, but wait, the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe we can assume all the missing energy is the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

But no, wait, in reality, binding energy is released, but here, the sum of the rest masses is less than the initial mass, so the difference is the energy that's released as kinetic energy. So the total KE of both fragments is 3 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. The question is to find the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation T1_classical.

So, we need to calculate T1 using relativistic mechanics and then using classical mechanics, then find the difference.

Wait, but wait a second. So, the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

So, let me denote the two fragments as A and B. A is the more massive one, mass 2x, and B is x. Their velocities are v_A and v_B.

Relativistic momentum: p = gamma m v.

But since the total momentum is zero, the momenta must satisfy p_A = -p_B. So gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_B m_B v_B. Hmm, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, since the mass ratio is 1:2, perhaps their velocities are in a certain ratio?

Alternatively, in the center of momentum frame, which in this case is the rest frame of the original nucleus, the velocities are such that the momenta cancel.

Wait, but if the masses are in a 1:2 ratio, then their velocities must be in a 2:1 ratio to have the same momentum magnitude but opposite directions. But that's only if they're non-relativistic. But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, that might not hold.

But maybe we can proceed by considering energy and momentum conservation.

So, the total energy after fission is sum of rest energies plus kinetic energies.

Wait, the initial energy is just M c² = 300 GeV. After fission, the energy is (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2), where m1 and m2 are the rest masses of the fragments. Since m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, their rest energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which we've established.

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Also, because the total momentum is zero, p1 = -p2. So,
