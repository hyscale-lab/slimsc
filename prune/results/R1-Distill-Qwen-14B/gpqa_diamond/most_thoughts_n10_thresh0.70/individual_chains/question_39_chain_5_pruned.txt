Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Each particle can move along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit odd. Normally, wave functions are complex but they have to satisfy certain conditions, right?

So the setup is that each system is identical, and when they measure the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. That means the probability of finding the particle is zero outside the interval [1,3]. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, implying that the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, wait. But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's a bit confusing. Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the wave function is written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some exponential or something else? Or maybe it's just a function that's valid only in a certain region. 

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But the square root of (1 + x) would have a domain where 1 + x > 0, so x > -1. But the measurements show that particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, but the given expression is valid within that region.

Wait, but in the given expression, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That seems to have both real and imaginary parts. Hmm, but wave functions in quantum mechanics can be complex, right? The square of the absolute value gives the probability density.

Wait, but the wave function needs to be normalized. Because the total probability of finding the particle in all space must be 1. So, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1.

So the plan is: find the normalization condition. Compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3, set it equal to 1, and solve for '
