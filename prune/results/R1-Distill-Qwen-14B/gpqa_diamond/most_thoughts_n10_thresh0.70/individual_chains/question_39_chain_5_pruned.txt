Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a wave function. Hmm, I remember that wave functions in quantum mechanics need to be normalized, meaning the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function outside this region isn't given, but the problem says that when they measured, all particles were in that interval. So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. Or maybe the given wave function is only valid in that region, and zero elsewhere. So, I think the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but for real wave functions, they must satisfy the normalization condition. However, wait a second, wave functions can be complex, but their modulus squared gives the probability. Hmm, but this function is complex, so I need to calculate the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over the interval where it's non-zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the wave function ψ(x) is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. To normalize it, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx
