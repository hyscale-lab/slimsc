Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right. So each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1. Since each spin has two possibilities, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

I think I should list all possible states and calculate E for each. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to find the number of states with each possible energy. Because calculating each one separately might take time, but maybe patterns emerge.

Let's consider the possible values of each term in the energy expression. Each term like S1S2 can be either +1 or -1 because S1 and S2 are ±1. So S1S2 is +1 if they're the same, -1 otherwise.

So the energy E is -J times the sum of these three terms. So E = -J (A + B + C), where A, B, C are each ±1.

Let me think about the possible values of A+B+C. Each of A, B, C is ±1. So the sum can vary. Let's find all possible sums:

Each term can be either +1 or -1. Let's consider the number of +1s and -1s among A, B, C.

The possible sums are from 3*(+1)=3 down to 3*(-1)=-3, in steps of 2. So possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, let's compute all possible sums.

But wait, each of A, B, C is either +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), -3 (all -1).

Wait, let me count the number of ways each sum can occur.

For sum 3: all three terms are +1. So only 1 way.

Sum 1: there are three terms, and two are +1, one is -1. So the number of such combinations is C(3,2) =3.

Sum -1: similarly, two terms are -1, one is +1. Also 3 ways.

Sum -3: all three terms are -1. Only 1 way.

So the sum S = A+B+C can be 3, 1, -1, -3. The number of states with each sum is 1,3,3,1 respectively.

Wait, but each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. Each of them can be ±1. So for each of the 8 states, we can compute S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy for each possible state.

But that might be time-consuming, but maybe manageable.

Each spin has two possible states, so 8 possible states in total.

Let me list all possible combinations:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1-1+1= -1. E=J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum is -1-1+1=-1. E=J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1=-1. E=J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1=-1. E=J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   Sum is 1+1+1=3. E= -J*(3)= -3J.

Wait, let me double-check these calculations.

Wait, for state 2: S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1*(-1)= -1, S2S3=+1*(-1)=-1. So sum is +1 + (-1) + (-1)
