Okay, so I've got this question about a molecular biology experiment, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher is trying to study their interaction's developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. 

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the vector has two open reading frames (ORFs). The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES regulatory element. I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can facilitate the translation of a second gene in a bicistronic construct without needing a second promoter. So the ligand is driven by CBA, and the receptor might be driven by the IRES, which is probably in the same transcript as the ligand.

Wait, but the vector is a lox-Cre vector. Lox-P sites are used for recombination with Cre. Oh, right, the construct probably has lox sites around certain regions, so that Cre can excise them. 

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I'm a bit fuzzy on how these work. So, for the ligand, the stop cassette is flanked by loxP sites. If Cre is present, it will excise the stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed along with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor's stop cassette is flanked by lox2272 sites. When Cre is introduced, it will remove that stop, allowing the receptor to be expressed along with eGFP.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are in the same vector. So the idea is that Cre will excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. But how does this work in the presence of Cre? 

In the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins to check Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin loading, so the expression is working, I think. Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. The SOX10 gene is involved in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably expressed in neural crest cells. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal microscope. They expected green signal from eGFP. But they didn't see any. So the question is why.

Possible options are A to D.

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If that's the case, maybe in the same cell, the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed together. But wait, the construct is designed so that both are expressed when Cre is present, so I'm not sure how paracrine would affect the fluorescence.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi
