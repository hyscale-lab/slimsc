Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage with multiple rings. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it's heated with a dihalide, I think it's an elimination reaction. So dibromide plus KOH would likely undergo dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but since it's dibromine on adjacent carbons, wouldn't that form an alkene? Oh right, in E2 elimination, two bromides on adjacent carbons would lose HBr twice, forming a double bond. But wait, Adamantane is a very rigid structure. So maybe the product is an adamantene derivative with a double bond.

The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because elimination usually gives alkenes, often less polar and maybe more colored if it's conjugated. The 1H NMR spectrum is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Hmm, the IR peak around 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but the first reaction is elimination, which should give an alkene. How does that fit?

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps it's not elimination but a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a base, more likely to cause elimination. Oh, but wait, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridge, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Alternatively, could it be that the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds? Oh, wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a double elimination. So,
