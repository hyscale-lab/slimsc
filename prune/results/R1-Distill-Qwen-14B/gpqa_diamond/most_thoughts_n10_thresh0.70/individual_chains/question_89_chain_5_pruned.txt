Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm pretty sure adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a diamond-shaped molecule, so it's a pretty rigid structure. The 1 and 3 positions each have a bromine atom attached.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, probably E2 since it's a strong base and high temperature. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Or maybe they're on opposite ends? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. So heating with KOH, which is a base, would lead to the formation of an alkene. So product 1 would be 1,3-diacetylenic adamantane? No, wait, elimination of HBr would form a double bond, not triple. So maybe 1,3-diene? No, wait, no, elimination from vicinal dihalides typically gives alkenes.

Wait, no, elimination of two HBr molecules would form a diene? Or maybe a conjugated diene? Wait, no, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So when KOH is added, each Br would eliminate, but maybe they eliminate in a way that forms a ring? Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, like a diamond. The molecular formula is C10H16, but wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would be C10H14Br2. So when KOH is used, each Br would be replaced by an -OH group? Wait, no, KOH in such conditions usually leads to elimination, not substitution. So perhaps each Br is on a different carbon, and elimination would form two adjacent double bonds, but that's maybe not possible because of the structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. KOH, when heated with vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Br atoms), leads to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Brs on adjacent carbons, heating with KOH would form a double bond between those two carbons. But I'm not entirely sure where the Brs are located on the adamantane. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol? No, because KOH is a base, and the reaction is elimination, not substitution.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide IR would show around 1250 cm-1. Alternatively, a ketone would show around 1700-1750 cm-1. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, so after eliminating HBr, perhaps we form a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe it's an elimination followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-type elimination, but that usually involves vicinal diols. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the initial reaction could be the formation of a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a double bond, and then that's followed by some oxidation? But in the presence of KOH, I don't think oxidation occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is a bit lower than a typical ketone
