Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, and the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. So, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The K value here is the formation constant, right? So the higher the K, the more stable the complex.

The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. But the question is about the free calcium ions. Because in solution, the complex might dissociate a bit, releasing some Ca²+.

So, the formation of the complex can be represented as Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given, which is 5e10. K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

Wait, the formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, and assuming that the EDTA is present in excess, or perhaps we can approximate that the concentration of the complex is the main species. But wait, no, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, but assuming that the complex is in a solution, some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. So the complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The K for this reaction would be 1/K_form, because K_form is for the formation, so the dissociation's K is 1/(5e10), which is a very small number. That means the dissociation doesn't go far; very little Ca²+ is released.

So, let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA would also be x, because each mole of dissociated complex gives one mole of each. The concentration of the complex
