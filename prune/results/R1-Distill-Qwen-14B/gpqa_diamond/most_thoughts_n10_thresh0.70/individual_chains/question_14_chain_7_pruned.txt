Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and how different fixation methods affect the results. Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. The question says they used PFA-fixed samples and an antibody for IKAROS in human B cells. Then they did sequencing and all the usual steps, but when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, the peaks disappeared. I need to figure out where those peaks would most likely be found.

Wait, what's PFA and DSG? I think PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker. It fixes proteins to DNA by creating covalent bonds. DSG is something elseâ€”oh right, it's dithiothreitol. It's a reducing agent. So maybe PFA alone isn't enough, or maybe DSG does something to the crosslinking.

In ChIP-seq, crosslinking is important to stabilize protein-DNA interactions. Without proper crosslinking, some proteins might dissociate, leading to loss of signal. But why would peaks disappear when using both PFA and DSG?

Wait, I think fixation can affect certain regions. PFA might crosslink more efficiently in some areas. Oh wait, I remember that PFA is a methanol-based fixative. Wait, no, PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is like formaldehyde, but when you have PFA+DSG, maybe it's a different crosslinking approach. Alternatively, maybe DSG is used as a reducing agent to break certain crosslinks.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. When you fix cells, you usually treat them with a crosslinker like formaldehyde. This covalently links proteins to DNA, making the binding sites more stable during the sonication step. But sometimes, different crosslinkers can affect different proteins or regions.

Alternatively, DSG is often used during the reversal of crosslinks. Wait, no. Oh wait, DSG is used to reduce disulfide bonds, which are formed during crosslinking. Formaldehyde can create crosslinks that form dimers through disulfide bridges. So DSG is used after crosslinking to break these disulfide bonds, allowing the proteins to be more accessible for sonication and digestion.

Wait, but in the question, both PFA and DSG are used for fixation. Maybe when you fix with PFA (
