Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking me to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, particles in a 1D infinite potential well have quantized energy levels. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And they mentioned E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n would just be n² times E. That makes it easier because I can just think in terms of multiples of E.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, since they're spin-1/2, which are fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold a certain number of particles. But in a 1D box, the quantum numbers are determined by the principal quantum number n, and the spin. Oh wait, for spin-1/2 particles, each n can have two possible spin states. So each n can have two particles. Because spin up and spin down.

So in a 1D well, each energy level E_n can accommodate two particles (because spin multiplicity is 2). So the first level (n=1) can have two particles, second (n=2) can have two, and so on.

But wait, because the particles are identical fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But since we're dealing with spatial and spin components, maybe that doesn't complicate things here because the spin part can be considered in the overall symmetry. But perhaps it's sufficient to think in terms of the exclusion principle that each (n, spin) state can have only one particle. So for each n, two particles can occupy it with opposite spins.

So, when we have four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels?

Ground state: the lowest energy configuration. So the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) can each hold two particles. So n=1: two particles, n=2: the next two. So in the ground state, all four particles are filled up to n=2. So the energies would be n=1 and n=2. But wait, the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. Wait no, wait. Each particle in a certain state contributes E_n, so for four particles, each in n=1 and n=2, but how?

Wait, each n can hold two particles. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2. So
