Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, it's about particle physics and kinetic energy. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, but wait, I think that's not right. Usually, pions decay into a muon and a neutrino. Oh wait no, maybe it's a muon and another particle. Wait, but the pion is Pi^+, so when it decays, it becomes a muon plus a neutrino? Or maybe a muon and a muon anti-neutrino? Because in beta decay, a pion would decay into a lepton and a neutrino. So Pi+ decays into mu+ and nu_mu, I guess. But not sure if that's relevant here.

The problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary. So initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must be zero as well. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, neutrinos have very small mass, but in this case, maybe the problem approximates the neutrino as massless? Or perhaps it's treated with relativistic equations. 

But wait, the problem is about kinetic energy. So let's think about energy and momentum conservation. 

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c², and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino
