Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of formation can be a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Wait, let me write it out to visualize better. Oh, I see, it's a molecule with multiple double bonds and branching. Maybe it's some kind of diene or something.

The given data is the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom. So for carbon, that's a lot. Then there are bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. 

Wait, so the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for this organic compound, I guess I need to figure out how many bonds are formed and broken when it's made from carbon and hydrogen.

But wait, no, the formula is a bit more involved. Because the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The standard approach is: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of
