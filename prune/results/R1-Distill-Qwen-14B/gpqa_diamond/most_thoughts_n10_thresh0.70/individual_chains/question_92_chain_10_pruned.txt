Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, how do I approach this?

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a long name. Let me try to count the number of each atom in it. Let's see: each (CH3) has 1 C and 3 Hs. So for each (CH3)2 group, that's 2 Cs and 6 Hs. But wait, it's attached to a C=CH- part. So maybe I should draw this structure to count everything properly.

Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of carbons and hydrogens in the formula. Let's see: the formula seems to be C9H14? Wait, let me check.

Looking at the structure: the compound starts with (CH3)2C=CH-... So that's 3 carbons (the central C with two CH3 groups and a CH group). Then another CH2, then a CH(CH3), another CH2, a CH, and ending with C(CH3)2. Let's count:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

First part: (CH3)2C=CH-: that's 2 methyl groups (each CH3), one CH2 (but wait, no, it's C=CH-). So the first part has 3 carbons (the central C, plus two from each CH3?), no, wait. Let me count each carbon.

Each (CH3)2C= is 3 carbons (the C, plus two CH3). Then CH- is another C, so four so far. Then a CH2: another C, five. Then CH(CH3): another C, six. CH2: another, seven. CH: another, eight. Then C(CH3)2: that's the ninth carbon. So total of 9 Cs.

Hydrogen-wise: each CH3 has 3 H, so (CH3)2C has 2*(3) =6 H. Then the C=CH has 1 H (since it's CH-). Then each CH2 has 2 H, so CH2 has 2. Then CH(CH3) has 1 (the CH) plus 3 (from methyl) =4. Wait, no, CH(CH3) is CH with one CH3, so it has 1 H attached to the central C and 3 from the methyl. So that's 4 H. Next CH2: 2 H. Then CH: 1 H. Then C(CH3)2: that's 2*(3) =6 H.

Wait, maybe I should just add them all up:

Each (CH3) is 3 H. Let's see:

The first (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's break each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: Each (CH3) contributes 3 H, so 2*(3) =6. Then the C=CH- has 1 H. So that's 7 H here.

2. CH2-: 2 H.

3. CH(CH3): 1 H on the CH plus 3 from the CH3, so 4 H.

4. CH2-: 2 H.

5. CH-: 1 H.

6. C(CH3)2: Each (CH3) is 3 H, so 2*3=6.

Wait, but wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So each CH3 is a substituent on the main chain. Let me count each CH3 group.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to count all the H's:

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 H. So in the formula, how many CH3 groups are there?

Looking at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C: two CH3 groups
- CH(CH3): one CH3
- C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups

So total CH3 groups: 2 + 1 + 2 =5. Each has 3 H, so 5*3=15 H.

Then, the other Hs are from the other parts: each CH2 has two H, each CH has one H.

Let me count:

CH2 groups: I see two CH2 groups in the middle (the first is -CH2- after CH=, and another CH2 before the CH). Wait, wait:

Looking at the structure:

Each section:

(CH3)2C=CH- : CH= has one H.

Then -CH2- : that's a CH2 group.

Then -CH(CH3)- : that's a CH with a CH3.

Then -CH2- : another CH2.

Then -CH- : a CH group.

So the CH2 groups are two in number: each contributes 2 H. So 2*2=4 H.

The CH groups are:

The CH= in the first part: 1 H.

The CH in CH(CH3): 1 H.

The CH in the middle (CH-): 1 H.

Wait, no, let me recount. Let's list each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : has a CH group (1 H).

2. CH2- : CH2 (2 H).

3. CH(CH3)- : CH (1 H), plus CH3 (3 H).

4. CH2- : CH2 (2 H).

5. CH- : CH (1 H).

6. C(CH3)2: but wait, that's the end. So the last part is CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, actually, in the structure, the last part is CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe I should think of the molecule as a diene?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just count all the H's based on the formula.

Wait, the molecular formula. Let me try to write it.

Each (CH3) is a methyl group. Let's count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3) contributes one C and 3 H.

The structure is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2 is two CH3 groups. So for (CH3)2, that's 2 C and 6 H.

Then the next parts: C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the main chain as:

C=C-C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to write the whole formula.

The molecule is C9H14.

Because:

Each (CH3
