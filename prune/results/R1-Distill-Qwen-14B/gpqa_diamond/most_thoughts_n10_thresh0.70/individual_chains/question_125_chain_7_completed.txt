Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, I remember that this is similar to the 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Each direction (x, y, z) contributes a one-dimensional oscillator, and because it's isotropic, they all have the same frequency ω.

The question has two parts: first, finding the energy of the third excited state, and second, determining how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). 

Wait, but another way to think about it is that the total quantum number n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy can be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω. Because each n (n_x, n_y, n_z) can be 0,1,2,..., the total n starts from 0 and goes up, with possible values like 0,1,2, etc.

Now, the first part is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state and how do excited states work here? The ground state is the state with the lowest energy. For the 3D oscillator, the ground state is when n_x = n_y = n_z =0, so n=0. The first excited state would be when the sum n increases by 1. So the first excited state is n=1, the second excited is n=2, and the third excited would be n=3. Because each excited state increments n by 1.

So the energy for the third excited state would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's (9/2) ħω. So looking at the options, options A and C have that energy.

Next, the second part of the question is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. So it's asking for the degeneracy of that energy level. The degeneracy comes from the number of different ways the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z can add up to the same n.

For n=3, what are the possible triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z =3? Each of n_x, n_y, n_z can be 0,1,2,3, etc., but their sum must be 3.

Let me list all possible combinations. Since the order matters, but in terms of quantum numbers, each is distinguishable.

So the possible combinations are:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → that's three.

(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,0,2), (0,2,1), (0,1,2) → each is a permutation of 2,1,0. Let's see: 3! =6 ways.

(1,1,1) → only one way.

So adding them up: 3 +6 +1=10.

So the degeneracy is 10. So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says energy (9/2)ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. So that fits.

Options C says 3, which can't be right because there are 10.

Other options have different energies or numbers. Like option B and D have different energies, probably for a different potential or setup.

So the correct option should be A.


The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers \(n_x\), \(n_y\), and \(n_z\) in the \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) directions, respectively. The energy of a state is given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right),
\]

or equivalently, in terms of the total quantum number \(n = n_x + n_y + n_z\), as:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

### Part 1: Energy of the Third Excited State
The ground state corresponds to \(n = 0\), and each excited state increments \(n\) by 1. Thus:
- Ground state: \(n = 0\),
- First excited state: \(n = 1\),
- Second excited state: \(n = 2\),
- Third excited state: \(n = 3\).

For \(n = 3\), the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

### Part 2: Degeneracy of the Third Excited State
The degeneracy of a state corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy, which is determined by the number of ways \(n_x + n_y + n_z = 3\) can be satisfied with non-negative integers \(n_x, n_y, n_z\). The possible combinations are:

1. \((3, 0, 0)\), \((0, 3, 0)\), \((0, 0, 3)\): 3 combinations.
2. \((2, 1, 0)\), \((2, 0, 1)\), \((1, 2, 0)\), \((1, 0, 2)\), \((0, 2, 1)\), \((0, 1, 2)\): 6 combinations.
3. \((1, 1, 1)\): 1 combination.

Adding these, the total degeneracy is:

\[
3 + 6 + 1 = 10.
\]

### Conclusion
The energy of the third excited state is \(\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega\), and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
