Okay, so I've got this question about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, but synchrocyclotrons are a bit different. Let me try to think through what the question is asking.

The problem states that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, wait, I should recall how synchrocyclotrons work. Unlike cyclotrons, synchrocyclotrons have a varying magnetic field. Oh right, because as the particle gains energy, its radius increases, which would require a stronger magnetic field to keep the cyclotron frequency the same. But wait, no, actually, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is kept constant because the radius increases as the velocity increases. So the cyclotron frequency would decrease as the particle's mass increases with velocity. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

Wait, I think in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep the time between revolutions (the period) synchronized with the alternating voltage. So the frequency of the voltage is adjusted as the proton's speed increases. But I'm not super clear on that.

But maybe I don't need to get into the detailed operation. Let's think about the energy and how many times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron.

The voltage is alternating, so it's providing energy each time the proton goes through the gap. Each time it goes through, it gets a kick of energy. So the total number of revolutions would be related to how much energy it gains each time it circles.

The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so all the energy comes from the voltage. Each time it goes around, it gains an energy equal to the voltage times some factor. Wait, but wait: the voltage is applied in an alternating manner, so perhaps each half-cycle (each time the voltage
