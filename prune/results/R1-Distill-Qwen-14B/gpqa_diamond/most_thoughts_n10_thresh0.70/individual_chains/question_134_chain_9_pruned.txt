Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, I think. 

The question gives me three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, wait. Wait a minute, so they're mixing three solutions. I need to figure out what reaction happens when these are mixed together. Let me think. 

HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic, right? And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when you mix an acid with a base, they should neutralize each other. But wait, I've got two acids and one base. That might complicate things. Or maybe the base is reacting with both acids? Hmm. 

Wait, maybe it's better to write out the possible reactions. Let's see. The acids are HCl and H2SO4. The base is Ba(OH)2. So, what reactions can happen here? 

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Its formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH⁻ ions. 

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates into H+ and Cl⁻. Each mole gives one H+. 

H2SO4 is a strong acid, but since it's diprotic, each mole gives two H+. But wait, actually, wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no. Wait, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it H
