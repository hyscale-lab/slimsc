Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance called X. I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime. Oh right, the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity.

The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I think the width is related to the particle's lifetime because the uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (which is Γ, the width) and the time uncertainty (which would be the lifetime τ) is on the order of ħ, Planck's constant over 2π.

Wait, the lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Oh, but I need to be careful with the units. Let me get the constants right. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. I should convert that to GeV to match the units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, that's the lifetime.

Next, I need the velocity of the meson. Since E_X is the production energy, which is probably the total energy of the meson. The energy E is related to the mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But wait, since E is given in GeV and mass is too, but c is in m/s, I'll have to handle units carefully.

Wait, in particle physics, sometimes they use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but here I need to convert back, so I better not make that assumption. Let me think: E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. Solving for p: p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c²)^2) ) / c². Wait, maybe better to express in terms of the relativ
