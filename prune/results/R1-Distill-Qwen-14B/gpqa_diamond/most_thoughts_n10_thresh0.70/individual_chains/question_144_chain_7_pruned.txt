Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values.

Wait, wait. I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula I think is something like distance = speed * lifetime. Oh right, yes. Because the distance a particle travels before decaying is its speed multiplied by how long it lives.

So, I need to calculate the lifetime first. The lifetime τ is connected to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is the decay width, right? So yeah.

But wait, let's think about units. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of energy times time. So the calculation would involve converting GeV to MeV to match units.

Wait, let me get the units straight. The width Γ is 320 MeV. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. But since Γ is in MeV, I should convert ħ to MeV·s. Let me compute that. 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s * 1000 MeV/GeV = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-22 MeV·s divided by 320 MeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582e-22 / 320 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's the lifetime.

Next, I need the velocity of the meson. Oh, right, because the mean lifetime is the proper time (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame). But when the particle is moving, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Wait, no. Wait, no, actually, the proper lifetime is τ. The lab frame would see a longer lifetime, so the distance is v multiplied by gamma times τ. Wait, wait, let me get this straight.

The decay length formula is L = v * gamma * c * tau. Hmm, no, wait, units might complicate things. Alternatively, I think the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times tau. And velocity is v. So L = v * gamma tau.

Alternatively, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = (E / m) * c * tau. Because when
