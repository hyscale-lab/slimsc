Okay, so I need to figure out how the state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from atomic physics.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Dipole transitions, specifically, have specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. Both are s-states because their l is 0 (since l is the azimuthal quantum number, and for s it's 0). But wait, for the transition to occur via dipole, the dipole operator must have a non-zero matrix element between the initial and final states.

The dipole selection rules are usually: Δl = ±1 for electric dipole transitions. So the l must change by 1. But wait, the initial l is 0 (since it's the 3s state), so the next l must be 1 (p orbital). But wait, in this problem, the transition is via two dipole transitions, so it's a two-step process.

So the first transition from n=3, l=0 to some state, then from there to n=1, l=0.

Let me think. The first transition would change l from 0 to 1. So the possible l for the intermediate state is 1. Then the second transition would change l from 1 back to 0. So that makes sense.

Now, for each transition, the selection rules apply. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by at most ±1 per transition, but in dipole transitions, the change can be 0, ±1.

But wait, the initial state has m=0. So in the first transition, m can go to 0, ±1. Similarly, the intermediate state's m will influence the second transition.

Let me outline the possible steps.

First transition: 3s (n=3, l=0, m=0) → 2p or 3p? Wait, no, because n can change. Wait, the selection rule for n is Δn = any integer, but in reality, for a dipole transition, the change in n is such that the transition is possible. So for each step, the n can change by any number, but in the hydrogen atom,
