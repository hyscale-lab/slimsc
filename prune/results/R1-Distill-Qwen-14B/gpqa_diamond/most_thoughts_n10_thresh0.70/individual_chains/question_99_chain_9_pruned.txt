Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The question says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, the strong peak at 1700 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have both an O-H and a C=O, so that fits. Wait, but maybe it's an ester or ketone? No, the broad peak at 3000 is more likely a carboxylic acid because esters usually have a less broad O-H stretch if they're present, but wait, maybe if it's an ester, the O-H wouldn't be present. Oh, wait, the 1700 could be a ketone too. But considering the broad peak, I think it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, there's no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, ruling out any alkenes. That's useful.

Now, the NMR details: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. That sounds complicated. Let me unpack that.

In NMR splitting, each neighboring set of equivalent protons splits the signal into a multiplet. So, if a proton is next to two different sets of non-equivalent protons, it could lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let me think about that. A quartet implies that a proton is next to a group with 3 neighboring hydrogens (n+1 rule). Then, if that's split by another group, maybe a triplet, which would be from a neighboring group of 2 H's. And then a doublet from another neighboring group of 1 H. So, that's like (n=3) → quartet, then split by n=2 → triplet of quartets, but wait, maybe I have the order wrong. Alternatively, it's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which might imply each splitting step adds another level.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is split by three different neighboring groups. For example, if a CH is attached to three different CH2 groups, each with different environments. But I'm not sure. It's a bit confusing.

The second signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, similar idea but with different splits. Maybe attached to three different types of neighboring groups, each contributing their own splitting.

Alternatively, considering the structure of the compounds given, perhaps the NMR signals come from specific environments in the molecule. Let's look at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure would be something like (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps it's more like a geminal di-substitution. Let me think, maybe the structure has two CH groups each attached to different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH(CH2COOH) or something else. Wait, no, looking again: each C(H) is attached to two substituents. For example, in option A, the structure could be:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2COOH

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon chain with substituents.

Wait, let me see the options again:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5
