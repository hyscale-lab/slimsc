Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. And when they eclipse each other, it's because their orbital plane is edge-on from our point of view.

The question mentions two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have their own eclipse periods. System_1's period is 2 years, and system_2's is 1 year. Wait, but the problem says these periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Oh right, so that's the orbital period of the binary system. So the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period.

Then there's the radial velocity (RV) part. In system_1, the stars have RV variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. I think the RV method in binary stars relies on the Doppler shift. Each star's velocity around the center of mass is measured. The more massive star moves slower because it's closer to the center. So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

Wait, right. The mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary divided by the primary. So if m1 is the primary mass and m2 is the secondary, q = m2/m1. Then, the velocity of each star, v1 and v2, is related to their masses. From Kepler's third law, the sum of their velocities is related to the orbital period and their separation. But perhaps I should think about how the velocities relate to each other and the masses.

I remember that in a binary system, the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if m1 is bigger, v1 is smaller. So if the velocity amplitudes are 10 and 5 for system_1, then for the two stars, their velocities are v1 = 10 and v2 =5. Then the mass ratio would be m2/m1 = v1/v2. Wait, because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2 (since the center of mass is the same point). So yes, m2/m1 = v1/v2.

So for system_1: v1 =10, v2=5. So mass ratio q1 =
