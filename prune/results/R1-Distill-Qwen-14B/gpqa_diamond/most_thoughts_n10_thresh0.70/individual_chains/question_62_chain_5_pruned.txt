Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can get tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse its structure. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The aldehyde group is attached to a cyclohexane ring. Then, there's a substituent at the 1-position, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, so that substituent is a methylene group (-CH2-) where one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl group (hydroxy) and the other is a cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, so that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (like CH2-C≡CH) attached. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, attached to cyclohexane. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-H? Wait, I think ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a triple bond, so it's cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH? Or maybe it's cyclohexane with a triple bond between two carbons, making it a sp-hybridized carbon.

Wait, maybe ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group attached as a substituent. So, cyclohexane where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by C≡CH. So, cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent.

So the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane ring with a triple bond substituent, like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no. Wait, ethynyl is the group -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So, structure is cyclohexane attached to a triple bond, making it like cyclohexane-C≡
