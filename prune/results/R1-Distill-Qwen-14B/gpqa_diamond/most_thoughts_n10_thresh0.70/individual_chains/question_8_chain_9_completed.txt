Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease.

So the setup is that they've done a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. The idea is to understand how these genes function together in the resistance pathway.

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors usually regulate other genes, so if one is upstream, it's probably activating or repressing other genes involved in the pathway.

The results from the experiments are given as percentages of resistance compared to the wild type (control):

- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm. I need to figure out the relationships between these genes. Let's think about what each result implies.

First, let's look at the single mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests that G2 is a critical gene, perhaps the transcription factor since it's completely necessary. Because the resistance is gone, maybe G2 is the transcription factor that's upstream, activating other genes needed for resistance.

Then, g1 is at 75%, so the plant is less resistant but still has some. G3 is at 50%, so a bigger hit but not as bad as g2.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0%: same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as when only G2 is knocked out. This implies that G2's function is necessary, and maybe G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is already knocked out, adding G1 knockout doesn't make it worse than just G2 being out. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1, then without G2, G1 isn't expressed either. So knocking out both doesn't change the phenotype—it's just as bad as g2 alone.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%: same as g2. So knocking out G3 when G2 is already KO'd doesn't change the resistance. That suggests that G3's function is downstream of G2. Because without G2, G3 isn't doing anything. Wait, but in the single mutant g3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1, which is 75%. So G3 may be part of a different pathway or may be another component downstream of G2.

But let's think about the double mutants. For g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So the double mutant of g1 and g3 is much more susceptible than either single mutant. How does that happen?

If G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, their combined knockout would have a more severe effect. For example, if G1 is part of one pathway and G3 another, then knocking both out would disable both pathways. But in the case of g1, when G1 is KO, resistance is 75%, and g3 is 50%. So the double mutant g1g3 is 10%—much worse than either. So that suggests that both G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway or perhaps that they work in parallel pathways that are additive.

Wait, but if G2 is the transcription factor upstream, then G1 and G3 might be downstream of G2. Let me think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of B's mutants is seen only when A is functional. So, for example, if A is a transcription factor for B, then in a double mutant where A is KO, the effect of B's KO doesn't matter because A's function is already gone.

Looking at the data again:

g2 is 0% resistance. So, when G2 is KO, the plant can't resist. So, any gene downstream of G2 would be non-functional in g2. So, in the double mutants involving g2, the resistance is same as g2. For instance, g1g2 is 0%—so same as g2. That suggests that G1 is downstream of G2. Because when G2 is KO, G1's function doesn't matter anymore. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2 activity is upstream, its absence masks the effect of G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%—so same as g2. So G3 is also downstream of G2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Now, what about G1 and G3? Looking at their double mutant: g1g3 is 10% resistance. That's much worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops below either single mutant. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that each contribute to resistance. So, knocking both out eliminates more resistance. If they were in the same pathway, the double mutant might not be worse than the worse single mutant.

Wait, but why is the double mutant worse than both? Because maybe each contributes a part of the resistance. So, without G1, resistance is 75% (so 25% loss). Without G3, 50% (50% loss). Without both, 10% (90% loss). That suggests that when both are gone, the resistance is 10%—so that's additive or synergistic. So G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing some resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is the sum of their individual contributions. Alternatively, perhaps they function in parallel, each providing some level of resistance.

If that's the case, what does that mean about their relationship to each other and to G2?

Since G2 is epistatic to both, it's likely that G2 is a common upstream gene that activates both G1 and G3. So G2 is the transcription factor activating G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function, leading to 0% resistance.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which matches.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, that doesn't fit because g2 is a knockout with 0% resistance, which suggests that G2 is the transcription factor. If G1 were the transcription factor, knocking it out would be more severe than G2's, but here g2 is 0%, which is the most severe. So Option A probably isn't correct.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (so same regulation?), G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm. If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would depend on G3. But in our case, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. If G3 were epistatic, then knocking both G1 and G3 would be same as just G3, which is 50%. But our data shows 10%, so that doesn't fit. So probably not B.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. But I'm not sure how that applies here. Alternatively, "show pleiotropy" might not be the right term here. Or perhaps it's a typo and they meant something else. Alternatively, maybe it's about redundancy or something else.

If G2 is the transcription factor, then G1 and G3 are downstream. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the function of G3 depends on G1. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be as bad as when G1 is knocked out (75% maybe?), but our data shows it's 10%. So that doesn't fit. So maybe C is not correct.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, the single mutants would have some effect, but the double mutant would worse than either. Wait, in our case, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that would fit the idea of redundancy. Because when both are knocked out, the function is more severely affected. So gene redundancy would mean that when both are missing, the problem is worse than either alone.

But then, the other part: G1 is epistatic towards G3. Let me think. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 affects the phenotype of G3. So, for example, if G1 is a downstream gene, then the function of G3 depends on G1.

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would depend on G1's status. But in our data, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either. But if G1 were epistatic, then perhaps the phenotype would be similar to G1's knockout (75%), unless G3 also contributes something when G1 is present.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is in a pathway upstream of G3. Let me think about how epistasis works. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that might mean that G3's function is only seen when G1 is present. So when G1 is absent, the function of G3 doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, since G1 is absent, the G3 knockout doesn't matter, so the resistance would be same as G1 knockout (75%). But our data shows 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the presence of G3 affects the phenotype of G1. So in the double mutant, the effect would look like G3's phenotype (50%). But here, it's 10%—so that doesn't fit either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting epistasis direction wrong. Let me define it again. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene B's mutation is only seen when gene A is functional. So, for example, if A is upstream and activates B, then in a double mutant A and B, the phenotype is the same as the A mutant because A's absence prevents B from being expressed.

Wait, in our case, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So that suggests that both G1 and G3 are contributing to the resistance, and their functions are additive or synergistic. So perhaps they are in parallel pathways. So G2 is the transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. So, when G2 is gone, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is gone, G3 is still functional, leading to 50% resistance. If G3 is gone, G1 is functional, leading to 75% resistance. But wait, no: the data says G3 is 50% and G1 is 75%. So G3 contributes more to the resistance than G1. But that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no: G3 knockout has 50% resistance, so without G3, the plant is half as resistant. G1 knockout is 75%—so 25% loss. So G3's absence has a larger effect. So perhaps G3 is more critical than G1.

But why is the double mutant g1g3 at 10%? Because both are knocked out, so neither contributes. So their combined effect is additive. 75% (g1) plus 50% (g3) would be 25% each? No, that's not exactly additive. Alternatively, perhaps each contributes separately, so resistance is 75% when G1 is gone (so 25% loss), and 50% when G3 is gone (50% loss). If they're in parallel, their combined loss would be 75% + 50% - (75% *50%) = 75 +50 -37.5 = 87.5? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's multiplicative. 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, so 37.5% not 10%. Hmm. Or perhaps their contributions are not independent.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both necessary for a certain process. So, without G1, some function is missing, and without G3, another is missing, and the plant can't resist. But that would make it so the double mutant is more severe than either single.

Wait, but in that case, the double mutant of g1g3 would have 0% or something worse. But here it's 10%, which is higher than zero. Hmm, so maybe they are in separate pathways, and each contributes some resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of G1. So in the double mutant, both are knocked out, so the effect is worse than either. But that would imply that G3 is downstream of G1, but in that case, the epistatic relationships would be different.

Wait, let me think again about the options.

Option D says that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That means that either gene can compensate for the other. So, in the single mutants, each has some reduced resistance, but the double mutant is worse than either. That matches our data: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and the double is 10%, which is much worse. So if they are redundant, then when both are gone, the plant is more susceptible than when either is gone.

But what about the epistatic part? Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, if G1 is epistatic, then the effect of G3 knockout is only seen when G1 is present. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as the more severe single mutant. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than either. That doesn't fit. So perhaps that part is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the option. Let me read it again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. So G2 is the transcription factor. G1 and G3 are redundant—so when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. That fits the data for g1g3 (10%). Now, the epistasis part: G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is upstream of G3. So when G1 is knocked out, the function of G3 doesn't matter because G3 is downstream. So the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as g1. But our data shows that the double mutant is worse than either. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that part is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the resistance. So without G2, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. Without G1, G3 is still functional, leading to 50% resistance. Without G3, G1 is functional, leading to 75% resistance. But wait, the data says g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So that would make sense if G3 contributes more to the resistance than G1.

So, for the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, so resistance is 0% (but it's 10% in the data). Hmm, not matching. Wait, perhaps that suggests that there's a third pathway contributing, but the data doesn't show that. Alternatively, maybe the data isn't matching my hypothesis.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of G1. So G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. So the pathway would be G2 → G1 → G3.

In that case, the single mutants would be:

g2: 0% (as G2 is upstream, so everything downstream is inactive)
g1: G3 is non-functional because G1 is KO. So resistance would be the same as if G3 is KO. But our data says g1 is 75%, while g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G2 is upstream, and both G1 and G3 are downstream but in separate pathways. So G2 activates both G1 and G3. So:

- In g2, both G1 and G3 are KO, so resistance is 0%.
- In g1, G3 is functional, so resistance is whatever G3 contributes (50%).
- In g3, G1 is functional, contributing 75%.
- In g1g2, G1 is KO and G2 is KO, but since G2 is upstream of G1, perhaps G1 isn't expressed. So the phenotype is same as g2 (0%).
- Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2.

Now, the double mutant g1g3: both G1 and G3 are KO, but G2 is functional. Wait, no—g1g3 is a double mutant of g1 and g3. So in this case, G2 is functional because only G1 and G3 are knocked out.

Wait, no, because in the data, the double mutants are among the three genes. So for example, g1g3 is when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is still functional. So in this case, G2 is active, so it can activate G1 and G3. But since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, they can't do their jobs. So the resistance would be as bad as when both are KO, which is 10%. But why 10% and not 0%?

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. In the double mutant, only G1 and G3 are KO. G2 is functional. So G2 is trying to activate G1 and G3, but since they're knocked out, nothing happens. So the resistance would rely on any other pathways not involving G1 and G3. But in the data, the resistance is 10%, which is pretty low. Maybe there's another gene that's providing a small amount of resistance, so without G1 and G3, that's all that's left.

So, in this scenario, G2 is the transcription factor activating G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to the resistance. So when both are knocked out, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. That suggests redundancy in their function.

But the options don't directly say this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in this case, G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning that when both are gone, the effect is worse. That matches the data. The part about G1 being epistatic to G3 is confusing. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the effect of G3 depends on G1. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the effect would be same as g1 (75%), but the data says 10%. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistatic part is incorrect in option D.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the double mutants.

In the double mutants where G2 is not involved (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. So in g1g3, G2 is functional, so it's activating G1 and G3. But since G1 and G3 are knocked out, they can't respond. So the function is lost, leading to low resistance.

So, the fact that g1g3 is 10% suggests that there's another factor contributing to resistance, maybe a third pathway that's not dependent on G1 or G3. But perhaps that's not part of the current experiment's scope.

Now, going back to epistatic relationships. Let's think about which gene is epistatic to which.

g2 is 0%: so G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, because when G2 is KO, the other genes don't matter.

In the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2's KO masks the effect of G1's KO, meaning G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, it's 0%, same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G3.

Now, between G1 and G3, which is epistatic? Let's look at g1g3 (10%). How does that relate to their individual single mutants (g1:75%, g3:50%)?

In the double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So the combined effect is more severe than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So the double mutant's effect is additive.

In terms of epistasis between them, which gene is epistatic to which? For that, let's look for double mutants where one is KO and the other is functional. Let's say if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in a double mutant where G1 is KO and G3 is functional, the resistance would be determined by G1's status. But in our data, when G1 is KO (g1:75%), G3 is functional because the mutant is only g1. Similarly, when G3 is KO (g3:50%), G1 is functional.

But in the double mutant where G1 is KO and G3 is functional, the resistance is 75% (which is worse than wild type, but not as bad as the double). Similarly, when G3 is KO and G1 is functional, the resistance is 50%.

Wait, but that doesn't directly answer which is epistatic. Alternatively, perhaps the data doesn't provide enough information about the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3 because the double mutant g1g3 is more severe than either. So perhaps their functions are additive, implying they're in separate pathways, but epistatic relationships might not be straightforward.

But looking at the options, the only one that has G2 as the transcription factor is option C and D.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that a gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here. Alternatively, maybe they meant that G1 and G3 have multiple effects, but that might not directly apply.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

I think gene redundancy fits the data because the double mutant is worse than either. But the epistatic part doesn't fit because if G1 is epistatic towards G3, the double mutant should look like g1, which is 75%, but it's 10%.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the direction of epistasis. If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g3 (50%). But in our case, it's 10%, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the double mutant is 10% is because both G1 and G3 are necessary. So it's a synthetic lethal interaction. But I'm not sure how that fits into the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and the 10% is due to other factors. But the epistatic part is not directly supported by the data.

Wait, another approach: looking at the double mutants.

In the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2's effect is epistatic. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Between G1 and G3, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%. So in this case, the effect is more severe than either. So G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So each contributes to resistance, and their combined knockout leads to additive effects.

So, in terms of epistasis, perhaps neither is epistatic to the other because their functions are additive. But the question is about which gene is epistatic to which.

Looking at the options, the only one that suggests G2 is the transcription factor is options C and D.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the presence of G1 affects the function of G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the effect would be same as g1, which is 75%, because G3's function is only seen when G1 is present. But in reality, it's 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Same as above. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at epistasis the wrong way. Let me think again.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the function of G1 depends on G3. So in a double mutant where G3 is KO, the effect of G1's KO would be masked. But in our data, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the function of G3 depends on G1. So in a double mutant where G1 is KO, the effect of G3's KO doesn't matter. So resistance would be same as g1 (75%). But in reality, it's 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm. Maybe the fact that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways doesn't necessarily imply an epistatic relationship between them. It just means that their functions are additive.

So, putting it all together, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (gene redundancy isn't the case because their functions are additive, but perhaps they are in parallel pathways). So, looking at the options, which one fits?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But that doesn't fit because their double mutant is worse than either, which is the opposite of redundancy. Because redundancy implies that when both are gone, the effect is same as if one is gone. But here, it's worse. So gene redundancy is not the case.

Wait, no. Gene redundancy would mean that each gene can compensate for the other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is as bad as the worse single mutant. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than either. So gene redundancy isn't correct, because in redundancy, knocking out both would not make it worse than the worse single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant. So options C and D are incorrect regarding this.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (not redundant, not epistatic), but looking at the options, none of them directly say that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic to G1.

No, because G2 is the most severe, not G1. So A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Unlikely, because g1g3 is worse than either.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, which may not fit here. Also, as before, the double mutant not matching.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

But as discussed, their double mutant is worse than either, so gene redundancy is not correct.

Hmm. Maybe I've made a mistake in the entire approach.

Alternative approach: Let's think about what each option states and see if it aligns with the data.

Option A: G1 is TF. But no, because g2 is more severe. So A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF. Yes. G1 and G3 have same promoter. So they are co-regulated. G3 epistatic to G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the phenotype of G1 is only seen when G3 is functional. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G3's knockout (50%). But in reality, it's 10%. So that doesn't fit. So B is wrong.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy: not sure. G1 is epistatic to G3. So in double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G1's knockout (75%). But the data shows 10%, so doesn't fit. So C is wrong.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that when both are KO, the effect is same as the worse single mutant. But in data, g1g3 is worse. So redundancy is incorrect. So D is wrong.

Wait, but all options don't fit. Hmm. Maybe I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the data suggests that G3 is epistatic to G1 because in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% which is worse than G1's 75% but better than G2's 0%. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the only TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways. So, in the absence of G2, both are non-functional. But when either is knocked out, the other is functional, but the other contributes less. So G3 contributes more to resistance than G1.

So, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but function in parallel. But none of the options say that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, G1 and G3 are two different genes affecting resistance. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D. Because G2 is the transcription factor. G1 and G3's double mutant is worse, so they might be in separate pathways, which would fit gene redundancy only if they are in the same pathway. So perhaps I'm wrong about gene redundancy. Let me think again: gene redundancy refers to two genes that can compensate for each other. So, each gene's product can substitute for the other. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is the same as if either were knocked out. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than either, which suggests that they are not redundant. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the concept of synthetic lethality. In this case, the double mutant is worse than either, which is a form of synthetic lethality, not redundancy. So, perhaps the correct term isn't redundancy but synthetic lethality.

But none of the options mention that. So perhaps the best fit is that G2 is the transcription factor, the other options don't fit, but option D is the closest in some aspects.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy would require that when both are knocked out, the effect is same as the worse single mutant. But our data shows it's worse. So option D is not correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck. Let me think about the correct conclusion based on the data.

The data shows:

- G2 is the most severe, so it's the upstream gene (likely TF).

- G1 and G3 contribute separately, and their combined knockout is worse than either.

- So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (not redundant, not epistatic to each other), and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, which fits this?

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which is incorrect. So, none of the options perfectly fit.

Wait, perhaps none of the options is perfect, but let's read the options again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm, but as per our analysis, G1 and G3 are not redundant. So perhaps the correct option is not among the given options. But that can't be, as the question expects us to choose one.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but G1 is epistatic to G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is determined by G1's status. But our data shows that g1g3 is worse than either, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1. So, in the double mutant, the effect is determined by G3's status. But our data shows it's worse than either, so that doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 function in separate pathways, leading to additive effects. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps option C is the right choice.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G3's function depends on G1. So in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is same as G1's knockout (75%). But the data shows 10%, so that doesn't fit. So option C is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is option D.

Let me think about the epistatic relationships again.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is masked. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as g1 (75%). But the data shows 10%, so that's not the case.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is same as g3 (50%). But the data is 10%, which doesn't match.

Hmm. Maybe the data suggests that G2 is the only TF, and the other two are in separate downstream pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, leading to additive effects when knocked out.

But the options do not include this. So perhaps the correct option is D, even though the reasoning about epistasis is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that doesn't fit because G1 would be the TF.

Wait, another thought: in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% (same as g2). So G2's effect is epistatic to G1. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Now, what about G1 and G3?

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other; their effects are additive.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate downstream pathways, and their combined knockout leads to additive effects.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But redundancy would imply that when both are knocked out, the effect is same as the worse single mutant. But our data says 10% which is worse than either. So D is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option D, because the only option that names G2 as the TF is D and C. But as per our analysis, D's other points don't fit.

Wait, perhaps the only correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. But in the options, none of them state that. So perhaps the correct option is option D, but the reasoning is that G1 and G3 are in parallel (redundant) pathways, but the double mutant is worse, which suggests they are not redundant. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, despite some confusion. Because G2 is the TF, which fits, and the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, which suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (so, not redundant, but in separate pathways). But option D says gene redundancy, which is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and the part about gene redundancy is a mistake. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the data shows that G3 has a more significant effect than G1. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse, suggesting that G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should just choose the option that has G2 as the TF, and the correct epistatic relationships.

Looking at option D again: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But as discussed, gene redundancy is not the case, so D is incorrect.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is D because it has G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 in a redundant scenario, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another approach: if G2 is the TF, then in all cases where G2 is functional, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) are expressed.

In the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is functional, so it's activating G1 and G3. But both are knocked out, so their products are not made. Therefore, the resistance is low (10%) due to other factors.

In the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, G2 is knocked out, so G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

So, the fact that g1g3 is 10% suggests that there are other resistance mechanisms, but they're minimal. So, the main resistance is due to G1 and G3.

Between G1 and G3, the single mutants are 75% and 50%, so G3 contributes more.

Now, the epistatic relationships: since G2 is epistatic to both, it's the upstream gene.

Between G1 and G3, the double mutant is worse than either, so their effects are additive. So, they are in separate pathways. Thus, neither is epistatic to the other.

Looking at the options, which one fits this? None of the options perfectly, but perhaps option D is the best fit, despite the gene redundancy part, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and the reasoning is that G1 and G3 are redundant but in this case, their combined knockout leads to a worse phenotype, which contradicts redundancy. So perhaps none of the options is correct, but the closest is D.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct because it says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, when G1 is knocked out, the function of G3 doesn't matter. But in the data, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still functional, leading to 50% resistance. So the epistatic part doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck and might have to make an educated guess. Based on the data, G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. But among the options, the only one that correctly identifies G2 as the TF and has G1 and G3 in a redundant scenario is option D, but that doesn't fit the data. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, and the gene redundancy is actually gene interaction in parallel pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and gene redundancy is a misnomer for additive effects.

Wait, another thought: gene redundancy refers to when two genes can compensate for each other. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is same as the worse single mutant. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than either, so gene redundancy is not the case. Therefore, none of the options correctly describe the situation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and the part about gene redundancy is incorrect, but the other parts fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a TF upstream of others. So, perhaps only G2 is the TF, and both G1 and G3 are downstream.

In that case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, which fits the data.

Now, regarding G1 and G3, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%. So, their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either, implying additive effects. So, their functions are not epistatic but additive, meaning they are in separate pathways.

Looking at the options, the only option that has G2 as TF is options C and D.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So, in the double mutant, the effect would be same as G1's knockout (75%), but the data shows 10%, so that's not correct.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Same as above, doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But I'm not sure how pleiotropy applies here. Pleiotropy would mean that the genes affect multiple traits, but in our case, they're both involved in the same trait (resistance). So perhaps that's not the case.

I think the correct answer is option D, even though some parts don't fit, because it's the only option where G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in some form of redundant or additive pathways. But since I'm not confident, I'll have to go with that.


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine that contribute to resistance against anthracnose. The experimental results provide resistance percentages for single and double mutants, and the goal is to deduce the relationships between these genes, particularly focusing on whether one is a transcription factor (TF) and their epistatic interactions.

### Key Observations from the Data:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g2**: 0% resistance, indicating G2 is critical and likely the transcription factor (TF) upstream of other genes.
   - **g1**: 75% resistance, suggesting G1 contributes to resistance but is not as critical as G2.
   - **g3**: 50% resistance, indicating G3 also contributes to resistance but less than G1.

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance, same as g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to G1.
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance, same as g2, indicating G2 is epistatic to G3.
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, suggesting G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance and their effects are additive.

### Analysis of Gene Interactions:
- **G2 as the Transcription Factor**: The complete loss of resistance in g2 (0%) and the fact that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 (as seen in g1g2 and g2g3) strongly supports that G2 is the upstream transcription factor regulating G1 and G3.
- **G1 and G3 Contributions**: The single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) show that both genes contribute to resistance, but their effects are not redundant. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating that G1 and G3 function in separate pathways with additive effects.
- **Epistasis Between G1 and G3**: The data does not clearly indicate an epistatic relationship between G1 and G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, which is inconsistent with redundancy or one gene being epistatic to the other.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. G1 is not the transcription factor, as g2 (0%) is more severe than g1 (75%).
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 do not have the same promoter, and the data does not support G3 being epistatic to G1.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. G2 is the transcription factor, but there is no evidence of pleiotropy between G1 and G3. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than g1 (75%).
- **Option D**: Partially correct but flawed. G2 is the transcription factor, and the double mutant g1g3 (10%) suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant but rather function in separate pathways. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

### Conclusion:
The data supports that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance in separate pathways, leading to additive effects when both are knocked out. While none of the options perfectly fit the data, **Option D** is the closest, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor, even though the claim about gene redundancy and epistasis is not fully supported.
