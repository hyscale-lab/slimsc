Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll take it slow and think through each part.

The problem is about a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it forms a mixture Y of two other liquids through a disproportionation reaction. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives a hydrocarbon Z, which is a solvent and has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, and X has no conjugated multiple bonds.

Hmm. I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me start by understanding what each part means. First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Substances that do that usually have double bonds because they undergo addition reactions with bromine. So X must contain compounds with alkenes or maybe some other unsaturated bonds.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, X is a mixture, so perhaps each component undergoes a reaction. Or maybe one component undergoes disproportionation. Hmm.

Wait, the products Y don't decolorize bromine water. So Y doesn't have double bonds anymore. So X had some double bonds, and Y's components are saturated? Maybe X had something like an alkene which upon some reaction becomes something else.

Wait, but the reaction is with platinum when heated. Platinum is usually a catalyst for hydrogenation or dehydrogenation. Oh wait, but in the case of a mixture, perhaps one component is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated? But that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Because the reaction is a disproportionation, which suggests that a single species is both oxidized and reduced. But if X is a mixture, maybe each component undergoes a different reaction. Hmm, maybe that's
