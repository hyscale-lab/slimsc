Alright, so I've got this question about hydrogen atom transitions, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Okay, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. 

Wait, dipole transitions... right, the electric dipole selection rules. I think the key selection rules for allowed transitions in the hydrogen atom are: 

- Δn can be any integer (so n can change by ±1, ±2, etc.), but in practice, it's usually adjacent or nearby levels.
- Δl must be ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit. 
- Δm can be 0, ±1. So the magnetic quantum number m can stay the same or change by ±1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. The transition isn't allowed in a single step because l starts at 0 (s orbital) and needs to go to l=1, but wait, wait. No, because the initial l is 0, and the first transition must change l by ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1 (since l can't be negative, l=0 can't go to l=-1). 

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0, m=0. To go to |1,0,0>, which is n=1, l=0, m=0. That's a change in n by -2 (3 to 1), and l remains 0. But that can't happen in a single dipole transition because Δl must be ±1. So the transition must occur in two steps.

So the first transition must change l from 0 to 1. Then, the next transition can change l back to 0. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to n' and l=1, and the second transition goes from l=1 to l=0.

Wait, but what about n? The initial n is 3. After the first transition, n must change. Let's see, because the first transition is a dipole, Δn can be ±1 or ±2, but from 3, it's more likely to go to 2 or 4. But wait, after the first transition, the second transition must take it to n=1. So if the first transition goes from 3 to 2, then the second can go from 2 to 1. Alternatively, if the first goes from 3 to 4, the second would have to go to 3, but that doesn't help because we need to end up at n=1. So probably, the first transition is from 3→2.

So the
