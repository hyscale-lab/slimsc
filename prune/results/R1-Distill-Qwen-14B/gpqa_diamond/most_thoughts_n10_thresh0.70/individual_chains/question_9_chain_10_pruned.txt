Okay, so I've got this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and should also be symmetric when reflected across a horizontal plane.

Looking at the options, I see four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo... something, and a triphenyleno... something. Let me think about each one.

Triisopropyl borate. I recall that triisopropyl borane has a trigonal planar structure because boron has three valence electrons. But wait, triisopropyl borate is an ester. The borate would have three isopropyl groups attached to boron. So the structure would be something like O-B with three isopropyl groups. Wait, no, triisopropyl borate is actually (i-Pr)3BO, right? So the boron is at the center with three isopropyl groups and an oxygen. Wait, no, wait. Borate would be the conjugate base, so maybe it's (i-Pr)3B-O-. But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Anyway, the point is, it's a central atom connected to three identical groups. So that's trigonal symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? If the three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, then maybe it has a C3 axis. But for C3h, it needs a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm. The molecule would have to be planar, perhaps. Wait, the isopropyl groups are bulky and might cause the molecule to be non-planar. So maybe the overall symmetry is lower. Not sure yet.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, I think. It's a norbornane derivative with an amine group. Wait, norbornane is a bicyclo structure, right? So quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic amine. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane with an NH group. The molecule has a bridged structure, so maybe it's symmetric. Let me think about
