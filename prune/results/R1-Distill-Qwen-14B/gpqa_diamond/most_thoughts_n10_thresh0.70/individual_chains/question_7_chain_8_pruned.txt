Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking me to find the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process γγ → e+e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. Hmm, alright, I need to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that gamma-ray photons can interact with the CMB photons. When a high-energy gamma-ray photon meets a low-energy CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. This process is probably the main way that such high-energy gamma-rays are absorbed in the universe, so their numbers are limited by this interaction.

I think this is a problem involving photon-photon interactions and cross-sections. The cross-section is a measure of the probability that a particular interaction will occur. So the lifetime of the gamma-ray photon would be determined by the rate at which it interacts with the CMB photons.

The general formula for the interaction rate Γ (gamma) is given by Γ = n * σ * v, where n is the number density of the target photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity. But wait, for photons, the velocity is the speed of light, so maybe v can be considered as 1 in natural units, or just included in the cross-section somehow.

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for the photon-photon cross-section. The cross-section for γγ → e+e- is known, but I don't remember the exact expression. I think it's proportional to the square of the logarithm of the energy ratio. Or maybe it's something like σ ≈ (α^2 / (4π s)) * (ln(s/m_e^2) - ln(m_e^2)), where s is the squared center-of-mass energy, and α is the fine-structure constant. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit fuzzy here.

Alternatively, I remember that at high energies, the cross-section for γγ → e+e- can be approximated as σ ≈ (α²/(4π)) * (ln(s) - ln(m_e²)) / (s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass
