Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about eigenvectors of a spin operator. Hmm, I remember that spin operators in quantum mechanics are related to the Pauli matrices. Let me think step by step.

The problem states that we have an operator P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these components is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. Wait, those matrices look familiar. Like, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are commonly used for spin-1/2 systems like electrons or muons.

The question is to find the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, so the operator in the direction n would be P · n. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis, perhaps. So n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ)? Wait no, since it's in the x-z plane, the angle would be in that plane. So maybe n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no, wait. The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so it's (n_x, 0, n_z). Let me represent that as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ). Wait, depends on how we're parameterizing it. I think the standard way is to take θ as the polar angle from the z-axis. So n_x would be sinθ cosφ, but since φ is 0 or π because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or π, so cosφ is ±1. But the problem says an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so φ could be any value, but
