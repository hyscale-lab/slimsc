Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary, lying in the x-z plane. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin operators are often represented as vectors, and the eigenstates have specific properties.

Wait, the operator components are given: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me jot them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Wait, but the operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But for an eigenvalue equation, P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So the eigenvector is such that when P acts on it, it gives (ħ/2) times the same vector.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the eigenvector of the operator P in the direction n. Oh, wait, perhaps the operator in question is the component in the direction n. So the operator P_n would be (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the question says the operator is along n, so P is written as n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) ?

Right, so P = n·P, where n is a unit vector. Since n is in x-z plane, n has components (nx, 0, nz), and nx² + nz² = 1.

So the operator P is equal to nx P_x
