Okay, so I've got this physics problem about diffraction patterns. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field region where the intensity forms maxima and minima. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Wait, I remember that when the number of sides N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the aperture is effectively a circular one. That simplifies things because I can think about single-slit diffraction instead of a polygonal slit.

In single-slit diffraction, the positions of the minima occur at certain angles. The formula for the minima in single-slit is given by a*sin(theta) = m*lambda, where m is an integer (m = ±1, ±2, ...). Since the angles are small, sin(theta) is approximately equal to tan(theta), which is theta. So the equation simplifies to a*theta ≈ m*lambda.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the formula for the minima in single-slit diffraction is a sin(theta) = m lambda, where 'a' is the slit width. But I think in some cases, the formula is written as d sin(theta) = m lambda, where d is the distance from the slit to the screen or something else. Wait, no, in single-slit, the formula is a sin(theta) = m lambda, where a is the width of the slit. The first minimum (m=1) would then be at theta where a sin(theta) = lambda.

But wait, in this problem, the apothem is given as 'a'. Oh, the apothem of a polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius (the distance from the center to a vertex). So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' would be the radius of that circle. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the apothem is the distance
