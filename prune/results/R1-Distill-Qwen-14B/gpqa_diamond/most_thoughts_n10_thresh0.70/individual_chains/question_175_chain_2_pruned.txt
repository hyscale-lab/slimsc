Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to remember what I learned in electromagnetism.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. We need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the possible form of f as a function of lambda.

I remember that when a charge oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves. The power radiated depends on the angle theta. I think the radiation pattern for a dipole radiator (which this might be since it's oscillating along the z-axis) has a certain angular dependence.

Wait, right! For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far zone is such that the intensity (which is power per unit solid angle) varies with the angle theta. The intensity is proportional to (sin(theta))^2 or something like that. Or maybe it's (sin(theta))^2 times some function of lambda or the frequency.

Wait, no, let me think more carefully. The radiation from a dipole is maximum along the equator (theta=90 degrees) and falls off as you go towards the poles (theta=0 and 180 degrees). The intensity pattern is sin^2(theta) for a dipole, right? So the maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees.

Wait, no, wait. I think the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta) for a dipole. So the maximum occurs when sin(theta) is maximum, which is at theta=90 degrees. So at theta=0 (along the axis), the intensity is zero.

So, for this problem, the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle, depends on theta. If the maximum is at theta=90 degrees, then at theta=30 degrees, what's the fraction of the maximum power?

Wait, the problem states that A is the maximum power. So the function f(theta) must be such that when you integrate over all solid angles, you get the total power. But the question is about the fraction of A at a specific theta=30 degrees.

Wait, no, actually, the question says that the radiated power per unit solid angle is f, and the maximum power is A. So f is the intensity, and A is the maximum value of f.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the radiated power per unit solid angle is f( lambda, theta ), and the maximum of f is A. So f(theta) at any theta is less than or equal to A.

Wait, let me rephrase. The problem says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So the maximum value of f(theta) is A. So f(theta) has a maximum value of A, and elsewhere it's lower.

So for example, at theta=90 degrees, f(theta)=A, and at theta=0, f(theta)=0.

So, what's the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees?

Wait, no, wait. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So
