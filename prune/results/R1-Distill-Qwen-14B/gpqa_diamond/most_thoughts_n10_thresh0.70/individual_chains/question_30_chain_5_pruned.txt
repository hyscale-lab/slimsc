Okay, so I've got this question here about dyes and the light they emit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So the question says that a textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember something about conjugated pi systems and their relation to light absorption. Oh right! Conjugated systems, especially long ones, absorb light in the visible spectrum. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). So when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited from HOMO to LUMO.

But wait, the question is about the color emitted, not absorbed. Or wait, no, it's the opposite. The compound emits light when it drops back down to a lower energy state. So the emitted light's energy is the same as the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. But absorption and emission are related but opposite processes.

So the energy of the emitted photon determines the color we see. Wait, no, I think I get confused sometimes. So when a molecule absorbs light, it's because it's exciting an electron from HOMO to LUMO, and that requires a certain energy. The complementary color is emitted when it relaxes back.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of wavelength. The energy E is related to wavelength λ by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

Given E
