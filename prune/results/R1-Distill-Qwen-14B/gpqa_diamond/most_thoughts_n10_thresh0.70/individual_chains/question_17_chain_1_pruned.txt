Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The K value for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So, the formation constant, K, is involved here. The K for the complex is given as a very large number, which means the reaction favors the product, so the complex is stable.

The solution has a concentration of 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since it's a 1:1 complex, the concentration of each component (Ca²+ and EDTA^4-) should be equal in solution, assuming the complex dissociates a bit. Or wait, no, maybe I should think about the dissociation of the complex.

Let me write the equilibrium expression. The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But here, the solution has the complex at 0.02 M. So, let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x and EDTA^4- as y. But wait, when the complex dissociates, each mole of CaEDTA^2- produces one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates by 's' amount, then:

[Ca²+] = s
[EDTA^4-] = s
And [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02, because K is so large, s will be very small compared to 0.02.

Wait, no. Wait a second. If K is 5e10, that's a huge number, which suggests that the complex is almost completely formed. So, the dissociation isn't significant. So s is very small, so [Ca²+] = s, and [EDTA^4-] = s, and [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02.

But wait, another approach. The problem is that the solution contains
