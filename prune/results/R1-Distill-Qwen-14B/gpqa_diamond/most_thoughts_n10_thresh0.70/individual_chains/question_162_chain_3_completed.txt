Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2, given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Okay, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)](dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, since it's a pseudosphere, I guess it's a two-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space. Or wait, maybe it's a two-dimensional Lorentzian manifold? Because pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, but in higher dimensions, like maybe 2+1 dimensions? Or perhaps it's a hyperbolic space?

Wait, the metric has terms in dx² and dy², so it's likely two-dimensional. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That looks a bit like the equation of a circle, where x² + y² = 4 would be a circle of radius 2. But the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which would be zero when x² + y²=4. So the metric blows up there. That suggests that the radius is 2, since that's where the denominator becomes zero.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. I remember that for a sphere in Euclidean space, the area (surface area) is 4πr². But this is a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. Hmm, does that change the formula for the area?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing pseudosphere with the Riemann sphere. No, the pseudosphere is a surface with hyperbolic geometry. The area might be different. But wait, another thought: perhaps this metric is representing a hyperbolic space, specifically the two-dimensional hyperbolic space, parameterized by x and y coordinates.

In hyperbolic geometry, the area element isn't the same as in Euclidean space. The metric here is given, so maybe I can compute the area by integrating the area element over the entire space.

The area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. Let me compute the determinant of the metric. The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same, and the off-diagonal terms (g_xy and g_yx) are zero. So the determinant is g_xx * g_yy - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))².

Wait, no. Wait, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the diagonal elements. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of this would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Wait, but wait: to get the area, I need to integrate this over all x and y where the metric is defined. But the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which must be positive because otherwise the metric would have issues (like becoming singular). So the condition is 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the region of integration is the interior of a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin in the x-y plane.

So the area A would be the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Hmm, that's a challenging integral. Maybe I should switch to polar coordinates since the region is a circle.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r². So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. The integral over θ will just give a factor of 2π. So:

A = 2π ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me make a substitution: u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 * r dr ] / u = ∫ [32 * (- du/2) ] / u = -16 ∫ du/u.

The limits change from u=4 to u=0. So the integral is from 4 to 0, which is the same as the negative from 0 to 4. So:

-16 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du = -16 [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0.

Which is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral diverges to positive infinity because ln(0) is approaching -infty, so the expression becomes -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] → -16*(-infty) → +infty.

So the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 is divergent, it's infinite. So the area A would be 2π multiplied by infinity, which is infinity.

Wait, that's a bit concerning. So the area of this pseudosphere is infinite? That doesn't sound right. But wait, pseudospheres in hyperbolic geometry have infinite area, right? Because as you go further out, the area keeps increasing without bound. So maybe the pseudosphere in this metric has an infinite area, so the answer would be D) +infty.

Let me double-check. The metric is [32/(4 - r²)] in polar coordinates, so the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ. Integrating r from 0 to 2 gives a finite upper limit, but as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the integral of r/(4 - r²) dr near r=2 behaves like 1/(4 - r²), which integrated from, say, 1.99 to 2 would be roughly ∫ dr/(4 - r²) → as r approaches 2, the integral becomes large. So yeah, that's why the integral diverges to infinity.

So the area is infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty.


The problem involves finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) given the metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Metric Structure**: The metric is diagonal, with \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0 \). The determinant of the metric is \( \det(g) = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2 \), and the area element is \( \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy \).

2. **Region of Integration**: The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \) implies \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a circle of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. The area is computed by integrating the area element over this region.

3. **Switch to Polar Coordinates**: Using polar coordinates \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), the area element becomes:
   \[
   \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]
   The limits of integration are \( r \in [0, 2] \) and \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi] \).

4. **Integral Setup**: The total area is:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]
   The \( \theta \)-integration contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), leaving:
   \[
   A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]

5. **Evaluate the Radial Integral**: Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[ \ln|u| \right]_4^0.
   \]
   As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), making the integral diverge to \( +\infty \).

6. **Conclusion**: The area of the pseudosphere is infinite because the integral diverges as \( r \) approaches 2. This is consistent with the properties of hyperbolic geometry, where the area of a pseudosphere grows without bound.

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere is \( +\infty \).
