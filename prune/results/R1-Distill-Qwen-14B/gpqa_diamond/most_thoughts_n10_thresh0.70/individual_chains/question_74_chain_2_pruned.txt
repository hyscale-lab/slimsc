Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, earlier experiments show that in 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it decays. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. The question is asking, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait. So 50 minutes have passed, and it's still around. Now we're looking ahead 150 minutes. I think radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So the decay is memoryless, meaning the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, whether it's been 50 minutes or 10 minutes, the probability of decay in the next interval is the same as it was initially.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased might be a bit tricky. Let me think again. The decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. So, the decay constant is probably calculated based on that.

The decay formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt). The probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is P = e^(-λt). So, the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that, for 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%, which is 0.32. So,

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

So, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)
λ = - ln(0.68)/100

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately... ln(0.7)= about -0.3567, but 0.68 is smaller, so maybe around -0.3857 or something. Wait, exact value might not matter since I'm looking for a relative probability.

Now, the question is, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the remaining time to consider is 150 minutes? No, wait, the next 150 minutes. Wait, the
