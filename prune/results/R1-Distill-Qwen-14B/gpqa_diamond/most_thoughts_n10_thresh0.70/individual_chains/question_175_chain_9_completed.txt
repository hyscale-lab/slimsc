Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and the radiation they produce. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem states that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. We need to find two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f as a function of λ.

Alright, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroidal and symmetric along the z-axis, I think this is similar to a dipole antenna or something like that.

Wait, but wait. A dipole's radiation pattern is different. Oh right, a dipole radiates with a pattern that's maximum at the equator (θ=90 degrees) and drops off towards the poles (θ=0 and 180). So the radiation isn't isotropic—it's strongest in certain directions.

In the radiation zone, the electric and magnetic fields vary as 1/r, and the power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) can be found using the Poynting vector. For an oscillating dipole, the radiation intensity depends on the angle θ.

I think the formula for the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is given by something like (p² ω⁴ sin²θ)/(12π ε₀ c³), where p is the dipole moment. So the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. That makes sense because the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees (sinθ=1), and it's zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180). 

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the shape is spheroidal. A spheroid could be either an oblate spheroid (like a disk) or a prolate spheroid (like a cigar). But the symmetry is along the z-axis, so maybe it's an oscillating dipole? Either way, the radiation pattern might have a dependence on θ.

So, if the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and the question is asking about θ=30 degrees, which is closer to the axis, the intensity at 30 degrees would be lower than the maximum.

But wait, let's get back to the problem. The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which depends on λ and θ. So f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A. The question is, what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees.

First, let's think about the angular dependence. If the radiation pattern is sin²θ, then the intensity at θ=30 degrees would be sin²(30°)= (0.5)^2= 0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25, which is 1/4. But wait, is this the case here?

Wait, but spheroidal charge distributions can have different radiation patterns. For instance, a dipole has sin²θ, but maybe a quadrupole would have a different pattern. Alternatively, a spheroidal distribution might have a different dependence.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is about the form of f as a function of λ. So the power per unit solid angle depends on λ in some way.

Wait, from what I remember, for dipole radiation, the power radiated is proportional to the square of the frequency. Since λ = c/f, so frequency is inversely proportional to λ. So the power would be proportional to (1/λ²). But wait, the power per unit solid angle would also depend on the solid angle, but in the case of dipole radiation, the total power is proportional to (ω^4) * something. So let me think again.

The total power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by P = ( (p₀² ω^4 sin²(ωt) ) ) averaged over a cycle. Wait, wait, the average power is (p₀² ω^4)/(6π ε₀ c³). And the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is P/(4π) multiplied by sin²θ. Because 4π is the total solid angle, and the intensity is the distribution of power over solid angle.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The average Poynting vector, which gives the intensity, is I = (μ₀ p² ω^4 sin²θ )/(12π c³). So the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. And the total power is the integral of I over solid angle: ∫ I dΩ = ∫ (sinθ dθ dφ) I. So ∫0 to π, ∫0 to 2π. So substituting I = K sin²θ, where K is some constant.

So total power P = ∫ (K sin^3θ) dθ dφ. The integral over φ is 2π. The integral over θ of sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π. Let me compute that: ∫ sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π.

Hmm, the integral of sin^3θ is (1/3) ( -cosθ + (cos^3θ)/3 ), evaluated from 0 to π.

At π: cos π = -1 → (-cos π) = 1, (cos^3 π)/3 = (-1)^3/3 = -1/3. So [1 + (-1/3)] = 2/3.

At 0: cos 0 =1 → (-cos 0) =-1, (cos^3 0)/3 = 1/3. So [ -1 + 1/3 ] = -2/3.

So the integral from 0 to π is (2/3) - (-2/3) )= 4/3.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. The integral of sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π can be written as ∫ (1 - cos²θ) sinθ dθ. Let u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ. So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - u²) (-du) from u=1 (θ=0) to u=-1 (θ=π). So, ∫ from 1 to -1 of (1 - u²) (-du) = ∫ from -1 to 1 (1 - u²) du. That's 2 * ∫ from 0 to 1 (1 - u²) du. Which is 2 [ u - u^3/3 ] from 0 to 1 → 2*(1 -1/3 -0) )= 2*(2/3) )= 4/3. So yes, the integral is 4/3.

So total power P = K * 2π * (4/3) )= (8π K)/3.

But K is (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 )/(12 π c³ ), I think. Let me see: I = (μ₀ p² ω^4 sin²θ )/(12 π c³). So K is (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 )/(12 π c³).

So P = ∫ I dΩ = (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 )/(12 π c³) ) * 2π * (4/3) )

Simplify: (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 )/(12 π c³) ) * (8 π /3 ) )= (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 ) * (8 π ) / (12 π c³ *3 )

Simplify the numbers: 8/(12*3) = 8/(36)= 2/9.

So P = (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 ) * (2) / (9 c³ )

But I'm not sure if I'm going the right way. The point is, the maximum intensity occurs at θ=90 degrees, which is sinθ=1. So the maximum intensity is I_max = K sin^2(90) = K.

So the fraction of the total power P that is radiated at θ=30 degrees would be the intensity at θ=30 divided by the maximum intensity.

Wait no, because the intensity is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power is the integral of I over all solid angles. So the fraction of power in a small solid angle around θ=30 would be the integral around that angle. But in this case, the question is probably asking for the value of f(λ, θ=30 degrees) divided by A, where A is the maximum value.

Wait, the problem says the maximum power is A. So the maximum occurs when θ is 90 degrees, because that's where sinθ is maximum, right?

If the function f(λ,θ) is the power per unit solid angle, then the maximum value is A = f(λ, 90 degrees). So the fraction at θ=30 is f(λ,30)/A.

But since f is proportional to sin²θ, then f(30) = sin²(30) * A = (0.5)^2 A = 0.25 A. So the fraction is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, which is 0.25.

Now, looking at the options, the first part of the answer would be 1/4.

Next, the form of f. The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. For the dipole case, the intensity is proportional to (1/λ^something) multiplied by sin²θ.

Wait, let's think about how intensity depends on λ. Since λ = c/f and f is the frequency. And in dipole radiation, the power is proportional to ω^4, which is (2π f)^4. So ω^4 = (2π c /λ)^4, since f = c/(λ). So ω = 2π c / λ.

Thus, ω^4 is proportional to (1/ λ^4).

So the intensity I is proportional to (1/λ^4) multiplied by sin²θ.

Wait, but let me make sure. The intensity I is proportional to (p^2 ω^4) / (c^3), and p is the dipole moment which might depend on λ as well? Or is p a constant?

Wait, no. If the charge distribution is oscillating, the dipole moment p would be related to the charge and the displacement. The oscillation is at frequency f, which relates to ω. So p could be a function of time as p_0 sin(ωt), but when we average the power, we take the time average.

So in the expression for intensity, it's the square of the dipole moment, but since p is oscillating, the average power is proportional to p_0^2 ω^4.

So I = (μ₀ p_0^2 ω^4 sin²θ)/(12 π c^3 )

So substituting ω = 2π c / λ, because ω = 2π f and f = c/(λ), so ω = 2π c/(λ).

So ω^4 = (2π c / λ)^4. So I = (μ₀ p_0^2 (2π c)^4 / λ^4 sin²θ )/(12 π c^3 )

Simplify this:

I = (μ₀ p_0^2 (16 π^4 c^4) )/( λ^4 ) * (sin²θ) / (12 π c^3 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

16 π^4 c^4 / (12 π c^3 ) = (16 π^3 c )/(12 ) )= (4 π^3 c )/(3 )

So I = (μ₀ p_0^2 ) * (4 π^3 c )/(3 ) * (1/λ^4 ) * sin²θ ) * ( 1/(12 π c^3 ) ? Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the constants.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that the intensity is proportional to (1/λ^4) * sin²θ, so f is proportional to (1/λ^4) sin²θ.

So the function f would have a form of some constant times (1/λ^4) multiplied by sin²θ. Looking at the options, the form of f would be λ^−4.

So the function f is proportional to λ^(-4) multiplied by sin²θ. But the question is about the form of f in terms of λ, which, in the options, the form is given without the θ dependence. Wait, the options present the form of f as a function of λ, but in the question f is a function of both λ and θ.

Wait, the question says, "what is the possible form of f are, respectively," but looking at the options, each option includes a form for f and a fraction. So the options are:

Option C is 1/4, λ^(-4)

So if f is proportional to (1/λ^4) multiplied by sin²θ, then the form of f as a function of λ is λ^(-4), but it's also multiplied by sin²θ, which depends on θ.

But the question says, 'the fraction of A that will be radiated' and 'the possible form of f'. So the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is λ^(-4), so option C.

Wait, but wait, the question says 'the possible form of f are, respectively' — so the fraction is first, then the form. So looking at the options, option C is 1/4, λ^(-4).

So the answer would be option C: 1/4 and λ^(-4).


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, which radiates electromagnetic waves at wavelength \( \lambda \). The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), and the maximum power radiated is \( A \). The goal is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the possible form of \( f \) as a function of \( \lambda \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   For an oscillating dipole-like charge distribution, the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). This means the intensity is maximum at \( \theta = 90^\circ \) and decreases symmetrically toward the poles (\( \theta = 0^\circ \) and \( \theta = 180^\circ \)).

   At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), the intensity is proportional to \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength \( \lambda \)**:  
   The intensity \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \) for dipole radiation. This arises because the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), and \( \omega \propto \frac{1}{\lambda} \). Therefore, \( \omega^4 \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \), leading to a dependence of \( f \) on \( \lambda \) as \( \lambda^{-4} \).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   - The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).  
   - The form of \( f \) as a function of \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).  

   Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **Option C**: \( \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \lambda^{-4} \).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the form of \( f \) as a function of \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).
