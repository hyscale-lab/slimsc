Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's take it slow.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Wait, let me draw that structure mentally. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-CH(CH2?), wait no. Propene is CH2=CH2, but prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent from the double bond. So it's CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2CH2, but wait, that's not right. Oh wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=C-CH2 attached to the cyclohexane? Wait, no, the substituent is at position 5, so it's a substituent like CH2-C(CH2?) Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's an allyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)CH2 where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2-C(=CH2)- but wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2, but the substituent is attached to the middle carbon? No, wait, wait, the substituent is at position 5, so the prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH(CH2) attached to the ring. Wait, maybe it's isopropenyl? Like the group is CH2-C(CH2) with a double bond. Wait,
