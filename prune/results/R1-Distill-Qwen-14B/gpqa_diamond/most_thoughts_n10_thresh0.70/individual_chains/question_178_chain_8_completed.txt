Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the mass dimension of coupling constants relates to the renormalizability of the theory. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. So, I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I should recall that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is found by requiring that the entire term has mass dimension 4, since the Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4 in four spacetime dimensions. Wait, no, actually, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4? Or is it 4 in natural units? Let me think: in four dimensions, the action is dimensionless because it's integrated over four spacetime dimensions each with dimension 1 (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 because [Action] is dimensionless, and the integral is over d^4x, which has dimension [Mass]^-4. So the Lagrangian has [L] = 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So, for the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, each part contributes to the mass dimension, and the sum should be 4.

Let me break down each component:

1. ψ̄ is the Dirac adjoint spinor, which has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac field ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ also has 3/2.

2. σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, I think. Because in the Dirac equation, the gamma matrices are part of the terms with derivatives, which have dimension 1. But σ is a commutator of gammas, so each term in σ is a product of two gammas, but dimensionless.

3. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each derivative has mass dimension 1, and A_mu is a gauge field with dimension 1. So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2 (since each derivative brings a mass dimension 1, and A has 1, so each term is [∂ A] = 1 +1 =2. So F has dimension 2.

Now, let's count the dimensions. The term is κ times ψ̄ (3/2) times σ_{mu nu} (which is [gamma matrices]^2, so dimensionless) times psi (3/2), times F^{mu nu} (2).

So, putting it together: [κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = [κ] * (3/2) * (1) * (3/2) * (2) = [κ] * (3/2 *3/2 *2) 

Calculating the product: (3/2)*(3/2) is 9/4. Multiply by 2: (9/4)*2=9/2.

So the total mass dimension of the term is [κ] + (9/2) = 4. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So solving for [κ], we have [κ] = 4 - (9/2) = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1/2). Wait, that can't be right because none of the options have that. Oh wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check. The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let me compute each part:

ψ̄: 3/2
σ: each gamma is dimensionless, so their commutator is dimensionless. So [σ] = 0.
ψ: 3/2
F:2

So ψ̄ * σ * ψ * F would be (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2 = 0? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, that's not how it works. Each factor's dimension multiplies.

Wait, no, each part's mass dimension is multiplied together. So ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0 (since it's made of gammas which are dim 0), ψ is 3/2, F is 2.

So the product of the fields is (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2. Wait, no, wait: [ψ̄] =3/2, [σ]=0, [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2. So the product of the fields is [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F] = (3/2) * 1 * (3/2) * 2. Because σ is dimensionless, so 0 plus 1? No, mass dimension is additive when multiplied, but wait, [σ] is 0, so it's (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 * 1 (from σ's mass dimension being 0).

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: each factor's mass dimension is multiplied. So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [σ] is 0 (since it's made of gammas, which are dimensionless; [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is also dimensionless), [ψ] is 3/2, [F] is 2.

Wait, no, σ_{mu nu} is (i/2)[γ_mu,γ_nu], so [σ_{mu nu}] = [γ] * [γ] = 0 + 0 = 0. So it's dimensionless.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension: [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. Wait, no, because you add the dimensions when you multiply terms.

Wait, no, when you have a product like A B C D, the mass dimension is [A] + [B] + [C] + [D].

So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [σ] is 0, [ψ] is 3/2, [F] is 2. So adding them gives 3/2 +0+3/2 +2 = (3 + 2) + 0? Wait, 3/2 +3/2 =3, plus 2 is 5. So the total dimension from the fields is 5.

But the entire term has to have dimension 4 (since Lagrangian terms must be dimension 4). So the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F), which has dimension [κ] +5 =4.

So [κ] =4 -5 = -1.

Ah, okay, so [κ]_M is -1. So that would match option A or C. Now the next part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling constants having mass dimension <=4 in four dimensions. Wait, no, wait. The coupling constants in the interaction term determine renormalizability. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension. Wait no, another approach: The maximum mass dimension allowed for a renormalizable interaction is 4 in four dimensions. Because the interaction term is part of the Lagrangian, which has dimension 4. So each coupling must have a dimension such that when multiplied by the fields, the term is dimension 4.

Wait, but the coupling constants themselves can't have dimension higher than 4, because otherwise the term would have higher dimension, making it nonrenormalizable. So for a term like L = g φ^n, the dimension of g is [g] =4 - n*(dimension of φ). For renormalizability, [g] >=0. Because if [g] is negative, the term would have a higher dimension when included in the Lagrangian, making it nonrenormalizable.

Wait, no, perhaps another angle: The mass dimension of the coupling determines whether the term is renormalizable. For a term in the Lagrangian, if the coupling has a positive mass dimension, then the term is relevant (super-renormalizable), if zero, marginal (renormalizable), and negative, irrelevant (nonrenormalizable). Because in four dimensions, the dimension of a coupling g in an interaction term g O, where O has dimension d, is [g] =4 -d.

If [g] =4 -d >=0 → d<=4, so the interaction is renormalizable if [g] >=0 → d <=4. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a mass dimension ≤4; but no, actually, it's about the superficial degree of divergence.

Wait, another approach: The superficial degree of divergence of a Feynman diagram is D = 4 - (L * (mass dim of coupling)). If all possible diagrams have D ≤0, the theory is renormalizable. If any diagram has D >0, the theory is nonrenormalizable.

Alternatively, I remember that a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the term is nonrenormalizable because higher order terms would have higher dimensions. Since our κ has [κ] =-1, which is negative, the interaction is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but in our case, the coupling κ has [κ]=-1. So each vertex in a Feynman diagram would contribute a factor of κ, which is dimension -1. So for a diagram with N vertices, the total factor would be κ^N, which has dimension -N. But each vertex also brings in fields, each with their own dimensions.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the possible divergences. An interaction term with a coupling of negative mass dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at lower energies (since dimensionless couplings are marginal, positive dimensions are super-renormalizable, negative are non-renormalizable).

Wait, in four dimensions, the renormalizability condition is that the coupling has dimension [g] ≥ 0. Because if [g] <0, the term is dimension 4 + [g] (since the Lagrangian term is L = g O, where O has dimension 4 - [g]). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the interaction term is L = g Φ, where Φ is some operator. The dimension of L must be 4. So [g] + [Φ] =4 → [g] =4 - [Φ]. For the term to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0 → [Φ] ≤4. But in our case, the term is L= κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F), which is a four-dimensional operator. Because each ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So [ψ̄ σ ψ F ] = 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 5. So the operator has dimension 5. Then [κ] =4 -5 = -1.

An operator with dimension 5 is a higher-dimensional operator, which means the term is nonrenormalizable because any coupling to such an operator would have negative mass dimension. So the theory would not be renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]_M is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory renormalizable. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ in the given Lagrangian

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]

we analyze the mass dimensions of each component:

1. **Mass dimension of $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$**: The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $3/2$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has mass dimension $3/2$.
2. **Mass dimension of $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$**: The object $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is dimensionless.
3. **Mass dimension of $F^{\mu\nu}$**: The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ is defined as $F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu$, where $A_\mu$ is a gauge field with mass dimension $1$. Since derivatives $\partial_\mu$ have mass dimension $1$, $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $2$.

The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension $4$ because the Lagrangian density has mass dimension $4$ in four spacetime dimensions. The total mass dimension of the fields is:

\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is determined by requiring the entire term to have mass dimension $4$:

\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

Next, we assess the renormalizability of the theory. A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative, the interaction term is nonrenormalizable. Nonrenormalizable theories typically require an infinite number of counterterms to absorb divergences, making them not predictive at all energy scales.

From the given options:

- **Option A**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect** because the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect** because the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not $1$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct** because the coupling has a negative mass dimension, and the theory is nonrenormalizable.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect** because the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not $1$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
