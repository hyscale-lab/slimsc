Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm supposed to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν], right? So σ is an antisymmetric tensor made from the gamma matrices. And F is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism or some gauge field. 

I remember that in determining renormalizability, the key is the mass dimension of the coupling constant. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimensions. Wait, no, more accurately, the dimension should be such that the coupling has positive or zero mass dimension. Because in the renormalization group equations, couplings with positive mass dimensions are relevant (they can run and the theory can be predictive), while those with negative dimensions are irrelevant and might lead to non-renormalizable theories.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density, which should have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. Because in 4D, the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x requires the integrand (the Lagrangian) to have dimension 4.

Looking at the term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So I need to compute the mass dimensions of each field and constant in the term.

Let me break down the term:

- κ is the coupling constant. We'll find its dimension.
- ψ̄ is the Dirac adjoint of the spinor ψ. So the dimension of ψ is the same as ψ̄.
- σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Each gamma matrix has mass dimension 1, because gamma matrices are dimensionless in 4D? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in 4D, the gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices, but their product would have the same dimension as the fields they act on.

Wait, no. Let me
