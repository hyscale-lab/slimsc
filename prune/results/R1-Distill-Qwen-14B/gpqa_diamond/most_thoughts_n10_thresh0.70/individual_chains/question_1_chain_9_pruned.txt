Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

Wait, no, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy has an uncertainty of about ħ/τ. So if ΔE is the difference between E2 and E1, it should be much larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or perhaps it's each of their uncertainties, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is that the energy difference ΔE should be greater than ħ divided by the time resolution. So the time resolution is the time during which we measure, which would be on the order of the smallest lifetime. Or maybe the reciprocal of the sum of the lifetimes? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think. The uncertainty principle says that the energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ/(Δt), where Δt is the time over which the state is
