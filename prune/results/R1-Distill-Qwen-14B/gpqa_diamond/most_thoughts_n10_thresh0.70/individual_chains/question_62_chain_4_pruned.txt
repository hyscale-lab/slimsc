Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, the molecule has two cyclohexane rings. One of them is attached to a carbonyl group (because it's a carbaldehyde), and on the same carbon, there's another cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group that also has an OH group. So, the structure is cyclohexane ring with a CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group and a CHO group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is one cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. Then, on the same carbon as the CHO, there's a CH2 group, which is connected to a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, that would mean the same carbon (the 1-position) has both the aldehyde and the CH(OH)cyclohexyl group.

Wait, no, more accurately: the main ring is cyclohexane, and the 1-carbon (which would be adjacent to the ring) has a substituent. So perhaps it's a bridge or a substituent on the ring? No, wait, it's 1-(something)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the carbaldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring, and at position 1 (the same carbon as the aldehyde), there's a substituent which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group.

So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a carbon attached to the ring. That carbon has a CHO group, a CH2 group, and two other substituents? Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is cyclohexane with a -CHO group attached to one carbon. Then, at the same position (the 1-position), there's
