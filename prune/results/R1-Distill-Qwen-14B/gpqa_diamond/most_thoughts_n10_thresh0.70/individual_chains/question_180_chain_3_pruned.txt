Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules.

Hmm, okay, so I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when charges are arranged in space, they have potential energy due to their configuration.

Wait, but how do I calculate the potential energy for multiple charges? I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions, considering the potential caused by the others.

So the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 × 10^9 N·m²/C².

But in this case, there are multiple charges, 13 in total. Let me see. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So all 12 are at the same distance from the 13th charge.

Wait, but each of the 12 is 2m from P. So the 13th charge is at P, and the others are arranged in a sphere around it at radius 2m? Or maybe they're all at the same point 2m away, but I don't think that's possible without overlapping. Probably, they're arranged symmetrically, but the exact arrangement beyond the distance doesn't matter for the potential energy because each is at the same distance from P.

But wait, potential energy is a scalar, so for each charge, the potential due to other charges would contribute. But how?

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed. So the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between the 13th charge and each of the 12 others, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Ah, right. So the total potential energy U_total is the sum of two parts: the energy due to the 13th charge interacting with all the
