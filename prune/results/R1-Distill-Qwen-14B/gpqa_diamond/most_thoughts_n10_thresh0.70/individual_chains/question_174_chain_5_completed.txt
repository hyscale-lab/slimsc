Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission and comparing relativistic versus classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energy. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me read the problem again carefully.

The problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 (of the more massive fragment) and the value calculated using the classical approximation.

Alright, so let's break this down.

1. **Understanding the initial conditions:**
   - The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero.
   - After fission, two fragments are produced. Let's call their rest masses m1 and m2. Given that one is twice as massive as the other. Let's assume m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2 * m2.
   - The sum of their rest masses is 0.99*M, where M is the initial mass.

2. **Conservation of momentum:**
   Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. So, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. According to momentum conservation:
   m1 * v1 = m2 * v2 (since momentum is mass times velocity, and directions are opposite, so without considering direction, the magnitudes must be equal).

3. **Relating velocities and masses:**
   From m1 = 2m2, substituting into the momentum equation:
   2m2 * v1 = m2 * v2 → 2v1 = v2.

   Wait, but let me think about the direction. If m1 moves in one direction, m2 in the opposite. So, velocity signs would be opposite, but when considering magnitudes, v2 = 2 v1.

4. **Rest masses:**
   Total rest mass after fission is 0.99M. And m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting:

   2m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M → m1 = 0.66 M.

   Wait, let me compute that again. 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M /3 → 0.33 M. Yes, that's correct.

   So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M.

5. **Conservation of energy:**
   The total energy before fission is just the rest mass energy: 300 GeV (since it's at rest).

   After fission, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two fragments. Each fragment's total energy is its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So:

   E_total = (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2) = (m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2) = 0.99 M c² + (K1 + K2).

   Since energy is conserved, this must equal the initial energy, which is M c². So:

   0.99 M c² + (K1 + K2) = M c² → K1 + K2 = (M c²) (1 - 0.99) )= 0.01 M c².

   So the total kinetic energy released is 1% of the initial rest mass energy, which is 3 GeV (since 300 GeV * 0.01 = 3 GeV).

6. **Relating kinetic energies using momentum:**
   Since the fragments' velocities are related by v2 = 2 v1 (from earlier), but wait, no. Earlier calculation says v2 = 2 v1? Wait, no. Let me go back.

   From m1*v1 = m2*v2 (in magnitude, since directions are opposite). So substituting m1=2 m2:

   2 m2 * v1 = m2 * v2 → 2 v1 = v2. So v2 is twice v1.

   So, if v2 is larger, that means the lighter fragment is moving faster than the heavier one.

7. **Expressing kinetic energies:**
   The kinetic energy K for each fragment is (gamma -1) m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

   So:

   K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²
   K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c²

   And we know that K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

   Also, from the velocities, v2 = 2 v1, so the speed of the lighter fragment is twice that of the heavier one. Hmm, but wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly, but let's think about how to relate gamma1 and gamma2.

   Alternatively, perhaps we can express gamma2 in terms of gamma1, using their velocity relationship.

   Let's denote beta1 = v1 / c, beta2 = v2 / c.

   From earlier, beta2 = 2 beta1.

   So, beta2 = 2 beta1.

   Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). 

   So, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta1²)
   gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (2 beta1)²) = 1/sqrt(1 -4 beta1²).

   But wait, beta cannot be more than 0.5 because if beta1 is 0.6, beta2 would be 1.2, which is impossible (since velocities can't exceed c). So beta1 must be less than 0.5.

8. **Expressing K1 and K2 in terms of beta1:**
   K1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c²
   K2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c²

   Substituting m1 = 0.66 M and m2 = 0.33 M:

   K1 = (gamma1 -1) * 0.66 M c²
   K2 = (gamma2 -1) * 0.33 M c²

   So,

   K1 + K2 = 0.66 (gamma1 -1) M c² + 0.33 (gamma2 -1) M c² 
   = (0.66 (gamma1 -1) + 0.33 (gamma2 -1)) ) M c² 
   = (0.66 gamma1 - 0.66 + 0.33 gamma2 - 0.33 ) M c² 
   = (0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 - 0.99 ) M c² 

   And this sum equals 3 GeV, which is 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

   Wait, wait. Let me compute M c². The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV.

   So,

   0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 - 0.99 = (3 GeV) / (M c²) ) → 3 GeV / 300 GeV = 0.01.

   So,

   0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 - 0.99 = 0.01 → 
   0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.0.

   Now, substitute gamma2 in terms of beta1.

   Since beta2 = 2 beta1 → gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (2 beta1)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -4 beta1²)

   Gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - beta1²).

   Let me denote beta = beta1 for simplicity.

   So, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) → (gamma1)² = 1/(1 - beta²)
   Similarly, gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 4 beta²), so (gamma2)^2 = 1/(1-4 beta²)

   Let me see if I can express gamma2 in terms of gamma1.

   Let me think about 1-4beta² = (1- beta²) - 3 beta² → Not sure if that helps.

   Alternatively, let's express beta in terms of gamma1.

   beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma1^2)).

   Then, beta2 = 2 beta = 2 sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma1^2)).

   Then, beta2^2 =4 (1 - 1/(gamma1^2)).

   So, 1 - beta2^2 = 1 - 4(1 - 1/gamma1^2) = 1 -4 + 4/(gamma1^2) ) = -3 + 4/(gamma1^2).

   So, 1 - beta2^2 = (4/(gamma1^2)) -3.

   Since 1 - beta2^2 must be positive (because beta2 <1), so (4/(gamma1^2)) -3 >0 → 4> 3 gamma1^2 → gamma1^2 <4/3 → gamma1 < sqrt(4/3) ≈1.1547. So gamma1 must be less than about 1.1547.

   Hmm, that's interesting. So gamma1 is relatively small, which suggests that the velocities are not extremely relativistic.

9. **Putting it all together:**
   Our equation is:

   0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.0.

   But gamma2 is in terms of beta1, which is in terms of gamma1.

   Let me substitute gamma2 into this equation.

   Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 -4 beta^2) → substituting beta = sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2):

   beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1^2)

   So,

   beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma1^2 → 4 beta^2 =4 (1 -1/gamma1^2) → 1 -4 beta^2 = 1 -4 +4/gamma1^2 = (4/gamma1^2) -3.

   So,

   gamma2 = 1 / sqrt( (4/gamma1^2) -3 ) )

   Let me compute (4/gamma1^2) -3:

   Let me denote x = gamma1^2.

   Then,

   (4/x) -3 = (4 -3x)/x.

   So,

   gamma2 = 1 / sqrt( (4 -3x)/x ) ) = sqrt( x/(4 -3x) )

   So,

   gamma2 = sqrt( x / (4-3x) ) → squared, that's x/(4-3x).

   Hmm, perhaps this substitution can help.

   Now, let's go back to the equation:

   0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.0 → (0.66 gamma1) + (0.33 gamma2) ) =1.

   Let me factor out 0.33:

   0.33 (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) =1 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 100/33 ≈3.0303.

   Wait, 1 / 0.33 is approximately 3.0303. Hmm, perhaps I should write it as 100/33, but maybe that's not necessary yet.

   So, 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303 approx.

   But we have gamma2 in terms of gamma1.

   So,

   gamma2 = sqrt( x/(4-3x) ), where x = gamma1^2.

   Let me write this as:

   gamma2 = sqrt( gamma1^2/(4 -3 gamma1^2) )

   Let me square both sides to make it easier.

   (gamma2)^2 = gamma1^2/(4 -3 gamma1^2)

   Let me denote equation (A):

   2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 100/33 ≈3.0303.

   Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to make an assumption about the velocities and see if the kinetic energies are non-relativistic, but given that the mass is split into 0.66 and 0.33 of the initial mass, perhaps the velocities are non-relativistic. Let me consider using the classical approximation first, then compare.

10. **Classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**
    In the classical case, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

    Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2. With m1=0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

    So, (0.66 M) v1 = (0.33 M) v2 → 2 v1 = v2.

    So, v2 = 2 v1.

    The total kinetic energy is (1/2 m1 v1²) + (1/2 m2 v2²) ) = (1/2)(0.66 M v1²) + (1/2)(0.33 M (2v1)^2 )

    Simplify:

    = 0.33 M v1² + (1/2)(0.33 M *4 v1²)
    =0.33 M v1² + 0.66 M v1²
    =0.99 M v1².

    But from conservation of energy, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV (0.01 * 300 GeV).

    So,

    0.99 M v1² = 3 GeV → M v1² = 3 /0.99 ≈3.0303 GeV.

    Then, the kinetic energy T1 (of the more massive fragment) is (1/2) m1 v1².

    Which is (1/2)(0.66 M) v1² = 0.33 M v1².

    From above, M v1^2 =3.0303 GeV → 0.33 *3.0303 ≈1 GeV.

    So T1 (classical) is approximately 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

    Hmm, but wait, 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy. If in the classical case, T1 is 1 GeV, and T2 is 2 GeV (since T2 = 0.33 M v2² =0.33 M (4 v1²) *1/2 → 0.66 M v1² = 2 GeV? Wait, let me recheck.

    Wait, in the classical case, T1 is 0.33 M v1² and T2 is 0.33 M * (2v1)^2 * 0.5 → 0.33 M *4 v1² *0.5 = 0.66 M v1².

    So T1 + T2 = (0.33 + 0.66) M v1² = 0.99 M v1² =3 GeV → M v1² =3 /0.99 ≈3.0303 GeV.

    So T1 is 0.33 *3.0303 ≈1.0 GeV → 1000 MeV.

    Hmm, that's a lot.

    But wait, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So the binding energy is 1% of M c², which gives 3 GeV. But in classical approximation, all of that 3 GeV is kinetic energy. But in reality, due to relativity, some of this energy is actually the increase in rest mass (since the fragments are moving, their rest mass increases), so the actual kinetic energy must be less than the classical value.

    Wait, wait, no. Because in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass and kinetic energy. So when the nucleus splits, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is less than the initial rest mass (99% here), which implies that the binding energy released (3 GeV) is the total energy available, which includes the kinetic energy and any rest mass increases.

    Hmm, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

    The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the fragments have rest mass energy of 0.99*300=297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which is the sum of the kinetic energies plus any rest mass increases. Wait, but wait: according to relativity, the rest mass of the fragments includes their kinetic energy, but I think that might not be correct.

    No, that's not right. The rest mass of each fragment is just their rest mass, irrespective of velocity. So when the nucleus is at rest and splits into two fragments, the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M, and the initial rest mass is M. So the difference is 0.01 M, which is 3 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which is all available for kinetic energy (since in the center of mass frame, the rest masses are fixed, and the kinetic energy comes from that energy difference). So in reality, the total kinetic energy of the fragments is 3 GeV.

    Wait, but wait, in the real scenario, the fragments are moving, so their energies are their rest mass plus kinetic energy. But the initial nucleus is at rest, so the sum of the fragments' energies must equal the initial energy.

    So,

    E_initial = M c² = E1 + E2.

    E1 = (m1 c² + K1), E2 = (m2 c² + K2).

    So,

    M c² = (m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2).

    So,

    K1 + K2 = (M - (m1 + m2)) c² = (M -0.99 M) c² = 0.01 M c² =3 GeV.

    So the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy available is 3 GeV.

    Now, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is all 3 GeV, but in reality, some of that energy is used up in the increase in rest mass (gamma factor), so the actual kinetic energies would be less than the classical case.

    Wait, no. Because the rest mass of the fragments is fixed (m1 and m2), their kinetic energy comes from the energy difference. So the rest masses m1 and m2 are given, so their rest mass energies are 0.66 M c² and 0.33 M c². So the initial energy is M c², and the sum of the rest mass energies is 0.99 M c². Therefore, the remaining 0.01 M c² is the kinetic energy, which is 3 GeV. So the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is 3 GeV. 

    So in reality, K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

    But in the classical approximation, I found that K1 (classical) is 1 GeV. So the correct K1 must be less than that because relativistic effects would require more energy to account for the increased rest mass (gamma factor). Wait, no: in reality, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So if the velocity is high enough that gamma is greater than 1, then the kinetic energy is positive. But in the case where the fragments are moving, the kinetic energy is indeed (gamma -1) m c².

    Wait, but in this case, the sum of the kinetic energies is fixed at 3 GeV. So why would the correct K1 be less than the classical value? Because the classical calculation assumes that all the energy is kinetic, but in reality, some energy goes into the rest mass via gamma factors. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

    Wait, no: the rest mass of each fragment is fixed. So the gamma factors are only for their kinetic energy. Because the rest mass is given, so m1 and m2 are fixed. Therefore, the kinetic energy comes from the difference between the initial rest mass and the sum of the rest masses of the fragments.

    So in reality, the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. The problem is to find T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) in reality and compare it with the classical approximation.

    So, perhaps the problem is that in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy is 1 GeV, but the correct relativistic value is less, or more?

    Wait, let's think about it. If the velocity is high, the kinetic energy in relativity is higher than the classical calculation. Because for low speeds, the classical KE approximates the relativistic KE, but as speeds increase, the relativistic KE is larger.

    Wait, no. The classical KE is (1/2)mv², and the relativistic KE is (gamma -1) mc². At low velocities, gamma is approximately 1 + (1/2) v²/c². So KE_rel ≈ (1/2 mv²) + (3/8 mv^4 /c²) + ... So for small v, relativistic KE is a little larger than classical.

    But, wait, in our case, the sum of the KEs is fixed at 3 GeV. So the actual KE for each fragment depends on how the velocities are distributed.

    So perhaps the correct T1 is less than the classical value because in reality, some of the energy is used in the gamma factors (i.e., the higher energies required for higher velocities), which would mean that the kinetic energies are lower than the classical assumption. Or the opposite, maybe.

    Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this differently.

11. **Relating the velocities using momentum:**
    Let me express the velocities in terms of beta.

    From earlier, v2 =2 v1 → beta2 = 2 beta1.

    So, beta1 = beta, beta2=2 beta.

    So, from the total energy equation:

    0.66 gamma1 +0.33 gamma2 =1.0.

    Let me write that again:

    0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

    And gamma2 is in terms of beta, which is in terms of gamma1.

    Maybe we can substitute gamma2 into the equation.

    So,

    0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 * [1/sqrt(1-4 beta^2)] =1.

    But beta is sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2).

    Let me substitute beta in terms of gamma1:

    Let me let gamma1 = g.

    Then,

    beta = sqrt(1 -1/g²).

    So,

    4 beta^2 =4 (1-1/g²) =4 -4/(g²).

    So,

    1-4 beta^2 = 1 - (4 -4/g²) ) =1-4 +4/g^2 → (4/g^2) -3.

    So,

    gamma2 =1/sqrt( (4/g^2) -3 )

    So,

    gamma2=1 / sqrt( (4 -3g²)/g² )= g / sqrt(4 -3g²).

    So,

    0.66 g + 0.33 ( g / sqrt(4-3g²) ) =1.

    So equation becomes:

    0.66 g + (0.33 g) / sqrt(4 -3g²) =1.

    Let me factor out g:

    g [ 0.66 + 0.33 / sqrt(4-3g²) ] =1.

    Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in g. It might be difficult to solve algebraically. Perhaps trial and error or substitution can help.

    Let me try possible values of g. Remember, from earlier, g must be less than sqrt(4/3) ≈1.1547.

    Let me try g=1.0.

    Then,

    denominator in the second term: sqrt(4-3*(1)^2)=sqrt(1)=1.

    So,

    0.66*1 +0.33*(1)/1 =0.66 +0.33=0.99 <1. So left side is 0.99 <1. So g must be larger than 1.

    Next, try g=1.05.

    sqrt(4-3*(1.05)^2 )= sqrt(4 -3*(1.1025))= sqrt(4-3.3075)=sqrt(0.6925)=approx 0.832.

    So,

    0.66 *1.05=0.693.

    0.33 *1.05 /0.832≈ (0.3465)/0.832≈0.416.

    Sum:0.693 +0.416=1.109>1. So g=1.05 gives LHS=1.109>1.

    So the solution is between g=1 and g=1.05.

    Let me try g=1.03.

    Compute 4-3g²:

    3*(1.03)^2=3*(1.0609)=3.1827.

    4-3.1827=0.8173.

    sqrt(0.8173)=0.904.

    So,

    0.66 *1.03=0.680.

    0.33 *1.03=0.3399. 0.3399 /0.904≈0.376.

    Sum:0.680 + 0.376=1.056>1.

    So g=1.03 gives sum=1.056.

    Let me try g=1.02.

    3g²=3*(1.0404)=3.1212.

    4-3.1212=0.8788.

    sqrt(0.8788)=approx 0.9375.

    0.66 *1.02=0.6732.

    0.33 *1.02=0.3366; 0.3366 /0.9375≈0.3587.

    Sum:0.6732 +0.3587=1.0319>1.

    Still higher than 1. Let's try g=1.01.

    3g²=3*(1.0201)=3.0603.

    4-3.0603=0.9397.

    sqrt(0.9397)=approx0.969.

    0.66 *1.01=0.6666.

    0.33*1.01=0.3333; 0.3333/0.969≈0.344.

    Sum:0.6666+0.344≈1.0106>1.

    Closer. Let me try g=1.005.

    3g²=3*(1.010025)=3.030075.

    4-3.030075=0.969925.

    sqrt(0.969925)=approx0.9849.

    0.66 *1.005≈0.6633.

    0.33 *1.005=0.33165; 0.33165/0.9849≈0.337.

    Sum:0.6633 +0.337≈1.0003 ≈1. So g≈1.005.

    So gamma1≈1.005, which is very close to 1. So the velocity is not very high, which makes sense because the sum of rest masses is 99% which is a small binding energy (3 GeV vs 300 GeV).

    So gamma1≈1.005.

    Now, compute gamma2.

    gamma2=gamma1 / sqrt(4-3g²).

    Wait, no, earlier substitution: gamma2= sqrt( x/(4-3x) ), where x=gamma1^2.

    So x= (1.005)^2≈1.010025.

    4-3x=4-3*1.010025=4-3.030075=0.969925.

    So,

    gamma2= sqrt(1.010025 /0.969925 )= sqrt(1.041)≈1.0203.

    So gamma2≈1.0203.

    Now, compute K1 and K2.

    K1=(gamma1 -1) m1 c².

    m1=0.66 M.

    So,

    K1= (1.005 -1) *0.66 M c² =0.005 *0.66 M c²=0.0033 M c².

    M c² is 300 GeV, so K1=0.0033 *300 GeV=0.99 GeV≈1 GeV.

    K2=(gamma2-1) m2 c².

    m2=0.33 M.

    gamma2≈1.0203 → gamma2-1=0.0203.

    So,

    K2=0.0203 *0.33 *300 GeV≈0.0203 *99 GeV≈2 GeV.

    Wait, wait, wait, adding K1 and K2 gives 1 +2=3 GeV, which matches the sum, so that's correct.

    So in reality, T1 is approximately 1 GeV.

    But wait, in the classical approximation, T1 was also 1 GeV. So the difference would be zero?

    But that can't be right because the options don't have zero. Hmm.

    Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

    Wait, in the classical approximation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is (1/2) m1 v1². And in the relativistic case, it's (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

    Wait, but I just computed K1 as (gamma1-1) m1 c²≈0.99 GeV, which is about 1 GeV. The classical case was also about 1 GeV. So the difference is negligible?

    Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the classical approximation. Let me recheck.

    In the classical case, the velocity is v. Then, from momentum conservation:

    m1 v1 = m2 v2 → (0.66 M) v1 = (0.33 M) v2 → v2=2 v1.

    Kinetic energies:

    K1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2 = 0.5 *0.66 M v1^2 =0.33 M v1^2.

    K2=0.5 *0.33 M (v2)^2 =0.5 *0.33 M (4 v1^2 )=0.66 M v1^2.

    So, K1 +K2=0.99 M v1^2 =3 GeV → M v1^2=3/0.99 ≈3.0303 GeV.

    So K1=0.33 *3.0303 ≈1.0 GeV.

    So in the classical case, K1 is 1 GeV.

    In the relativistic case, K1 is approximately 0.99 GeV. So the difference is about 0.01 GeV, which is 10 MeV.

    So the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, and the classical approximation is 1 GeV. So the correct value is 0.99 GeV, and the difference is 10 MeV (since 0.01 GeV is 10 MeV).

    So the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 is about 10 MeV.

    Looking at the options, option C is 10 MeV.

    So the correct answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process and compare the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) kinetic energies of the more massive fragment. Here's the breakdown:

---

### Key Information and Assumptions:
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The nucleus has a rest mass \( M \) and rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \).
   - The total rest mass of the fragments is \( 0.99M \), so \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \).

2. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Momentum Conservation**: Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero. Thus, \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), where \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) are the velocities of the two fragments.
   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after fission is conserved. The initial energy is \( M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \). After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments:
     \[
     M c^2 = (m_1 + m_2) c^2 + (K_1 + K_2).
     \]
     The energy released in the fission is:
     \[
     K_1 + K_2 = M c^2 - (m_1 + m_2) c^2 = 0.01 M c^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

3. **Rest Masses of Fragments**:
   - From \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \) and \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), we find:
     \[
     m_1 = 0.66M, \quad m_2 = 0.33M.
     \]

---

### Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:
In the classical case, kinetic energy is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). Using momentum conservation \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), we find \( v_2 = 2v_1 \). The total kinetic energy is:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2.
\]
Substituting \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), \( m_1 = 0.66M \), and \( m_2 = 0.33M \):
\[
K_1 + K_2 = \frac{1}{2} (0.66M) v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (0.33M)(2v_1)^2.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = 0.33M v_1^2 + 0.66M v_1^2 = 0.99M v_1^2.
\]
From energy conservation, \( K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), so:
\[
0.99M v_1^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \implies M v_1^2 = \frac{3}{0.99} \approx 3.0303 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
\[
K_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 0.33M v_1^2 = 0.33 \times 3.0303 \approx 1.0 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

---

### Relativistic Calculation:
In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy of each fragment is:
\[
K = (\gamma - 1) m c^2,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Using momentum conservation \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), we find \( v_2 = 2v_1 \). The total kinetic energy is:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 c^2 + (\gamma_2 - 1)m_2 c^2.
\]
Substituting \( m_1 = 0.66M \), \( m_2 = 0.33M \), and \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), we solve for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \). After detailed calculations, we find:
\[
\gamma_1 \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.0203.
\]
The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
\[
K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 c^2 = (1.005 - 1) \times 0.66M c^2 = 0.0033 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} \approx 0.99 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values:
The classical value of \( K_1 \) is \( 1.0 \, \text{GeV} \), and the relativistic value is \( 0.99 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
\[
\Delta K_1 = 1.0 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) value and the classical approximation is **10 MeV**.
