Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, using TLC, they saw that the reactant spot decreased and two new spots appeared. I have to choose which products are possible from the given options.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking that down: but-3-en-1-yl means a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon, and the substituent is attached at the first carbon. So the structure would be CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-O-benzene? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, no, because the en is at 3-en, so between C2 and C3. Because for but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait. Wait,
