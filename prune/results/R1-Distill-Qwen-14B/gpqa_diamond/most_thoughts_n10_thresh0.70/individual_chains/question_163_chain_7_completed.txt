Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. They want to know the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with a pH and a volume.

First, I think I need to figure out the reaction that happens when Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a strong acid. Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and a strong acid like HCl would react with it. The general reaction for such a case is: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 would require 3 moles of H+ ions (from the strong acid) to dissolve completely.

Next, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would help. Let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH group is 17 g/mol (16 for O and 1 for H), so three OH groups would be 51 g/mol. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

The mass given is 0.1 grams, so moles = mass/molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by around 107 is approximately 0.0009346, so yeah, about 9.358e-4 mol.

Since Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 H+ per mole, the H+ needed is 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

Now, the strong acid provided is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So, to find the volume needed, I can use the formula: moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). Rearranged, Volume = moles / Molarity.

So, Volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Wait, but the problem says "minimum volume," which suggests that this is the volume needed for complete dissolution, right? So that would be approximately 28.07 cm³. Looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³, which is close. Option B is 30.09, which is a bit larger. Hmm, wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recast the molar mass calculation. Fe is 55.845, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3: 55.845 + 3*(17) = 55.845 +51 = 106.845 g/mol. So mass 0.1g is 0.1 / 106.845 = let's compute that precisely. 0.1 / 106.845 ≈ 0.0009358 mol. So yeah, same as before.

H+ needed is 3 * 0.0009358 = 0.0028074 mol. So volume is 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³. So the answer should be near 28.07, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³. So for the first part, the volume is about 28.05 cm³.

Now, figuring out the pH. After dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, we have a solution of Fe³+ ions and excess H+. Let me think about the resulting solution.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. So, the solution will contain Fe³+ ions and Cl^- ions. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate H+ ions. But after reacting, the excess H+ comes from the acid not used in the reaction.

Wait, wait. Let me think about how much H+ is in the solution after the reaction. The moles of H+ contributed by HCl is (volume of HCl in liters) * 0.1 M. But some of that H+ is used in the reaction.

Wait, the initial HCl is added to 100 cm³ (0.1 L) of solution. Let's correct that: the total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, but the HCl is being added to that. So the total volume after adding HCl would be 100 cm³ plus the volume of HCl added. But wait, the problem says "prepare the solution" by adding the acid, but it's unclear if the 100 cm³ is the final volume or the initial. Hmm, the question says, "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." Oh, wait, maybe the 100 cm³ is the final volume. So when adding the acid, the total solution volume becomes 100 cm³. Wait, no, the question states: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution will be 100 cm³ after dissolving. So when you add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the HCl volume is V, but when added, the total solution is 100 cm³. So the initial solution might have been less than 100 cm³, and adding V cm³ of HCl makes it 100 cm³? Or maybe the 100 cm³ is the solvent. Hmm, perhaps I should model it as the total solution after adding HCl is 100 cm³, so the HCl volume is (100 - volume of Fe(OH)3 solution). Wait, but I don't know the volume of Fe(OH)3 as a solid. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the total volume, including the HCl added. So perhaps the HCl volume is V cm³, and the rest is water. Or perhaps I should assume that the 100 cm³ is the final volume, and the HCl is added so that the total volume is 100 cm³. But this might complicate things because the volume might change upon addition. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified by assuming that the volumes are additive, but since it's a small volume of acid added to 100 cm³, maybe the change is negligible. I'm not sure, but perhaps the problem expects to ignore the volume change from adding the acid, meaning that the HCl volume is V, and the total solution is 100 cm³.

Wait, but in any case, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps the HCl is added to 100 cm³ of solution. So the HCl is V cm³, but the total is 100 cm³. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the volume after adding the HCl. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says that you dissolve Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³. So perhaps the initial solution is 100 cm³, and you add V cm³ of HCl. But that would make the total volume more than 100 cm³, which contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps you add V cm³ of acid to a solution that's under 100 cm³, and the final volume is 100 cm³. Hmm.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to proceed. Let's assume that the total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ after adding the acid. So the HCl is V cm³, and the rest is made up to 100 cm³ with water. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is just considering that the entire HCl is added to the 100 cm³ of solution, and we can neglect the volume change. So, the moles of HCl added is 0.1 M * V (in liters). But some of that HCl is used to react with Fe(OH)3.

So, the moles of HCl required to dissolve Fe(OH)3 is 3 * n(Fe(OH)3) = 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol. So if the HCl added is more than this, the excess H+ will determine the pH.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum volume of HCl needed to completely dissolve Fe(OH)3. So the minimum volume is when the moles of HCl exactly equal the required 0.002807 mol. But wait, when you add a strong acid to a solid, you may need a bit more to get complete dissolution, but perhaps the calculation assumes exact stoichiometric amount.

Wait, but in practice, you might need more acid to fully dissolve the hydroxide, but the question is asking for the minimum, so perhaps it's the stoichiometric amount. So, the volume needed is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So that's the first part, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³.

Now, the pH part. After adding the HCl, the solution contains Fe³+ ions and excess H+ ions. Wait, but wait: when you add exactly the stoichiometric amount of HCl, all the Fe(OH)3 would dissolve, but would there be excess H+?

Wait, no. Because Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+ per mole to dissolve. So if we add exactly 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, then all the H+ would be consumed in the reaction. But in reality, other factors might mean that not all H+ is consumed, but perhaps the problem is assuming that only the necessary H+ is used, and the rest would contribute to the solution's acidity.

Wait, no. Because the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O. So if you add exactly 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, then all the H+ is used up, and the solution would be neutral? No, because Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic.

Wait, right! So even if all the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction, the Fe³+ ions will hydrolyze, producing more H+ ions and making the solution acidic. So the pH of the solution won't be neutral but acidic.

So I need to consider the hydrolysis of Fe³+ ions. Hmm, this complicates things. Let's think about this.

The solution after reaction contains Fe³+ ions. The concentration of Fe³+ would be based on the moles and the volume.

Wait, moles of Fe³+ is same as moles of Fe(OH)3 dissolved, which is 0.0009358 mol. The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). So concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M.

Fe³+ undergoes hydrolysis in water: Fe³+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. The hydrolysis produces H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of H+ from this hydrolysis. But for that, I need the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe³+.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the K value for Fe³+ hydrolysis. I think the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is a stepwise process, but maybe I can approximate it as a single step. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Ka or Kb for this reaction.

Alternatively, I remember that the hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be considered using its hydrolysis constant. Looking it up, I think the Ka for Fe³+ hydrolysis is around 1.0e-31, but that seems way too small. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the K is larger. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the hydrolysis reaction.

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

Wait, but if I'm not precipitating Fe(OH)3, then the solution can have a certain concentration of H+.

Wait, but in our case, after adding the acid, we have a solution that's at 100 cm³, and we have Fe³+ in solution. The concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009358 M. Let's denote [Fe³+] = 0.009358 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

The K for this reaction can be found using the solubility product of Fe(OH)3. Wait, Fe(OH)3 has a solubility product, Ksp. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.0 × 10^-38. But wait, that's for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3 OH^−. The Ksp is [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

But when Fe³+ is in acidic solution, it hydrolyzes to produce H+ ions. So, perhaps the hydrolysis reaction can be linked to the Ksp.

Alternatively, I can write the hydrolysis as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

The K for this reaction would be K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+].

But [Fe(OH)3] is the concentration of the solid, which we can assume is constant, so it's part of the K. Wait, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of the solubility product.

Wait, the Ksp is for the reverse of the hydrolysis reaction (since Ksp is for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 into Fe³+ and OH^-). So perhaps to get the hydrolysis reaction (which produces H+), we can combine the dissolution with the reverse of the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the acid dissociation of Fe(OH)3. Let's think of Fe(OH)3 as a weak base. The reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)4^- + OH^−.

But this might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution of Fe³+ will undergo hydrolysis to produce H+.

Wait, perhaps I can write the hydrolysis as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = (Kw / Ksp) * Ka, where Ka is the acid dissociation of water? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between Ksp and the hydrolysis.

Wait, let me think again. The solubility product Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is given by:

Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

In pure water, Fe(OH)3 would dissociate into Fe³+ and OH^- ions. But in acidic solution, the OH^- is consumed, so Fe³+ can hydrolyze further.

Alternatively, in the solution, the concentration of OH^- is very low (since it's acidic), so the reaction shifts to produce more Fe³+ and H+.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the hydrolysis to the Ksp. Let's write the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Rearranging the dissolution equation:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

But in the hydrolysis, the reaction is the reverse:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ → K_hydrolysis = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+].

Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant and can be considered part of the K. So,

K_hydrolysis = (1 / Ksp) * [H+]^3 / [Fe³+].

Alternatively, perhaps K_hydrolysis = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+]} * (1/Ksp).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I can express K_hydrolysis as Kw / Ksp * (something).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the K expression for the hydrolysis. Let me think of the hydrolysis reaction as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = ([Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, [Fe(OH)3] is a constant, so:

K = (constant * [H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

But what is this K? Let me think about the K in terms of Ksp.

From the dissolution: Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse of this is Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp.

But how does that relate to the hydrolysis reaction, which produces H+?

Wait, perhaps I can combine the two. The hydrolysis produces H+, which can be linked to OH- via Kw.

Let me try to write the hydrolysis reaction as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = (1/Ksp) * (Kw^3) / [Fe³+}.

Wait, perhaps I should take it step by step.

The dissolution reaction is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse of this would be:

Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

This can be rewritten as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction would be K = ([Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

But since [Fe(OH)3] is a constant (because it's a solid), we can write:

K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe³+] ) * [Fe(OH)3].

But [Fe(OH)3] is a constant, so it's part of the K. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this K to the Ksp.

Wait, perhaps I can express [H+] in terms of Ksp and [Fe³+}.

From the dissolution equation:

[OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+}.

But in the hydrolysis, the H+ concentration is linked to OH- via Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14 at 25°C.

So, [OH^-] = Kw / [H+].

Substituting into the dissolution equation:

([H+][Kw/ [H+}] )^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+}.

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Let me try another approach.

In the solution, [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M. Let's assume that the hydrolysis is significant enough that [H+] is determined by this process.

So, for the hydrolysis:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression for K is:

K = ([Fe(OH)3][H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, [Fe(OH)3] is constant, so K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe³+} ) * constant.

But I need the value of K for this reaction. Maybe it's better to express this K in terms of Ksp and other known constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the concentration of H+ produced by the hydrolysis.

Let me consider that the hydrolysis is the main source of H+ in solution. So, [H+] is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Let me denote x as [H+] contributed by hydrolysis. Then, the hydrolysis reaction produces 3x [H+], since for each Fe³+ ion, 3 H+ are produced.

Wait, no. Because the reaction produces 3 H+ per Fe³+. So, the concentration of H+ from hydrolysis would be 3x, where x is the concentration of Fe³+ that reacts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set up an equilibrium expression.

Let me denote s as the solubility of Fe³+ in terms of hydrolysis. So, s is the concentration of Fe(OH)3 that dissolves (but this seems conflicting since Fe(OH)3 is a solid). Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the hydrolysis produces H+ and consumes Fe³+.

Let me assume that [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M initially, and let it decrease by 'a' due to hydrolysis. The H+ produced would be 3a. So:

[Fe³+] = 0.009358 - a ≈ 0.009358 (if a is small compared to 0.009358).

[H+] = 3a.

The K for the hydrolysis can be written as:

K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe³+}.

But I'm not sure what K is. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the K in terms of Ksp.

Wait, from the dissolution equation:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction would be Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

Which can be thought of as combining the dissolution reaction with the acid conditions. Let me try to write the hydrolysis reaction in terms of the dissolution and another reaction.

The dissolution: Fe(OH)3(s) → Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse dissolution: Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp.

But hydrolysis involves Fe³+ reacting with water to produce H+ and Fe(OH)3.

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis can be considered as the reverse of the dissolution, but with H+ involved. Let me think of it as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

This reaction can be linked to the dissolution by considering that in the dissolution, OH^- is produced, but here, H+ is being produced. So, perhaps combining the dissolution reaction with the autoionization of water.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the hydrolysis in terms of the H+ and OH- concentrations.

Let me think again. For the hydrolysis:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = ([Fe(OH)3][H+]^3)/[Fe³+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is a constant, so K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe³+} ) * (1/Fe(OH)3's solubility constant).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express K as K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe³+} ) * (1/Ksp).

Wait, because from the dissolution, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3. So, [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+}.

But in the hydrolysis, the H+ concentration would be related to OH- via Kw: Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So, [OH^-] = (Kw) / [H+].

Substituting into the Ksp expression:

Ksp = [Fe³+} * (Kw/[H+})^3.

Rearranging:

[Fe³+} = Ksp * [H+]^3 / Kw^3.

Wait, that's getting somewhere. So,

[Fe³+} = (Ksp / Kw^3) * [H+]^3.

But wait, the K for the hydrolysis is K_hydrolysis = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+}.

Substituting [Fe³+} from above,

K_hydrolysis = [H+]^3 / ( (Ksp / Kw^3) * [H+]^3 ) ) = Kw^3 / Ksp.

So, K_hydrolysis = (Kw^3) / Ksp.

Given that Ksp is about 6e-38, Kw is 1e-14.

So,

K_hydrolysis = ( (1e-14)^3 ) / (6e-38) ) = (1e-42) / (6e-38) ) ≈ 1.6667e-5.

So, K_hydrolysis ≈ 1.6667e-5.

Wait, let me compute that:

(1e-14)^3 = 1e-42. 1e-42 divided by 6e-38 is (1 /6) * 1e-4 = approximately 0.1667e-4 = 1.667e-5.

So K_hydrolysis ≈ 1.667e-5.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is K_hydrolysis = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+}.

We can plug in the known values. Let's let [H+] = x. Since [Fe³+] is initially 0.009358 M, and assuming x is small compared to this concentration (which might not be the case, but let's try), we can approximate [Fe³+] ≈ 0.009358 M.

So,

K_hydrolysis ≈ x^3 / 0.009358 = 1.667e-5.

Solving for x:

x^3 = 1.667e-5 * 0.009358.

Compute that:

1.667e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.667e-5 * 9.358e-3 = let's compute.

1.667e-5 * 9.358e-3:

Multiply 1.667 * 9.358 ≈ 15.625.

Then, 1e-5 * 1e-3 = 1e-8.

So, x^3 ≈ 15.625e-8 = 1.5625e-7.

x = cube root(1.5625e-7) ≈ ?

Cube root of 1e-7 is 1e-2.333..., since (1e-2.333)^3 = 1e-7.

But 1.5625e-7 is a bit larger than 1e-7. Let me compute cube root of 1.5625.

Cube root of 1.5625 is approximately 1.16 (since 1.16^3 = approx 1.56).

So, cube root of 1.5625e-7 is approximately 1.16e-2.333.

Wait, 1e-7 is 1e-7, so cube root is 1e-7^(1/3) = 1e- (7/3) ) = 1e-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3.

Wait, 4.64e-3 is 0.00464.

So, 1.16 * 0.00464 ≈ 0.00538.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.5625e-7.

Take natural log: ln(1.5625e-7) = ln(1.5625) + ln(1e-7) = approx 0.44998 - 16.118 ≈ -15.668.

Divide by 3: -5.223.

Exponentiate: e^(-5.223) ≈ 0.00538.

So, x ≈ 0.00538 M.

So, [H+] ≈ 0.00538 M.

Then, pH = -log10(0.00538) ≈ ?

log10(0.00538) = log10(5.38e-3) = log10(5.38) + log10(1e-3).

log10(5.38) ≈ 0.7318.

So, log10(5.38e-3) ≈ 0.7318 -3 = -2.2682.

So pH ≈ 2.268.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise methods.

Wait, another approach: [H+]^3 = K_hydrolysis * [Fe³+}.

So,

[H+]^3 = 1.667e-5 * 0.009358.

Compute 1.667e-5 * 0.009358:

1.667e-5 = 0.00001667.

0.00001667 * 0.009358 ≈ 0.00000015625.

So, [H+]^3 = 1.5625e-7.

Then, [H+] = cube root(1.5625e-7) ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

So, pH = -log10(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.268.

Hmm, but the options given don't have 2.268. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³

B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³

C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³

D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³

So, my calculation of pH ≈2.27 is not exactly matching any option. The closest is option C (2.04) and option B (2.69). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_hydrolysis calculation. Let me double-check that.

Earlier, I thought K_hydrolysis = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

In the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe³+}.

Since [Fe(OH)3] is a solid, it's a constant, so K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe³+} ) * (1 / [Fe(OH)3} ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should express K in terms of Ksp.

From the dissolution equation:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe³+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction would be:

Fe³+ + 3 OH^- ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

This can be written as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

Let me write it as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

This is similar to the reverse dissolution, but H+ is being produced.

The K for this reaction would be K = ([Fe(OH)3][H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

Since [Fe(OH)3] is a solid, it's a constant. Let's call it C.

So, K = (C * [H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

But from the dissolution reaction, Ksp = [Fe³+}[OH^-]^3.

We can express [OH^-] in terms of [H+] using Kw: [OH^-] = Kw/[H+}.

So, Ksp = [Fe³+} * (Kw/[H+})^3.

Rearranging:

[Fe³+} = Ksp * [H+]^3 / Kw^3.

Substituting into the expression for K:

K = (C * [H+]^3) / (Ksp [H+]^3 / Kw^3 )) ) = (C Kw^3) / Ksp.

So, K = (C Kw^3) / Ksp.

But since C is a constant (related to the solubility of Fe(OH)3), perhaps it's incorporated into K. Alternatively, perhaps I can ignore it because it's a solid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that K for the hydrolysis is Kw^3 / Ksp.

Because from substitution, K = (Kw^3) / Ksp.

Given that, K = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-38 ≈ 1e-42 / 6e-38 ≈ 1.6667e-5.

So, same as before.

Then, using [H+]^3 = K * [Fe³+}.

So, [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.5625e-7.

So, [H+] ≈ cube root(1.5625e-7) ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.268.

But none of the options have pH around 2.27. The closest is option C (2.04) and option B (2.69).

Hmm, perhaps I missed something in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that all the Fe(OH)3 dissolves is incorrect. Because if we have added only the stoichiometric amount of HCl, would the solution have enough H+ to completely dissolve Fe(OH)3? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry calculation earlier.

Wait, let me recheck the stoichiometry.

Fe(OH)3 has a formula weight of 106.845 g/mol. 0.1 g is 0.1 / 106.845 ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

The reaction requires 3 H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. So, 0.0009358 mol * 3 ≈ 0.002807 mol H+ needed.

The HCl is 0.1 M. So volume needed is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So that part seems correct.

But perhaps the pH calculation is more complicated because the solution also contains chloride ions, but I don't think they affect the pH since Cl^- is the conjugate base of a strong acid and doesn't hydrolyze.

Wait, another thought: when Fe³+ hydrolyzes, it produces H+ and Fe(OH)3(s). So perhaps the actual [H+] is higher than what I calculated, because some of the Fe³+ may precipitate as Fe(OH)3 again, but that's beyond the point of the initial dissolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution doesn't have all the Fe³+ in solution, but some precipitates. But the problem states that we are to dissolve Fe(OH)3, so perhaps it's assumed that all of it dissolves, and the solution is clear.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the calculation of the hydrolysis K is incorrect. Let me look up the K for Fe³+ hydrolysis.

Upon a quick search in my memory, I think that Fe³+ hydrolysis has a K around 1e-31, but that's probably the Ksp. Wait, no. The Ksp is about 6e-38, but the hydrolysis K would be higher than that because it's an acid-catalyzed process.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis produces more H+ than I calculated, leading to a lower pH.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH considering both the H+ from the excess HCl and the H+ from Fe³+ hydrolysis.

Wait, no. Because in this case, we added exactly the stoichiometric amount of HCl needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So, all the H+ from HCl is used in the reaction, leaving no excess H+ from the acid. So the H+ in solution comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because when you add the HCl, the solution's H+ comes from both the reaction with Fe(OH)3 and any excess HCl.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the situation.

The reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

If I add exactly 3 moles of HCl per mole of Fe(OH)3, then all the H+ from HCl is consumed in the reaction. So no excess H+ remains. But wait, that's only true if all Fe(OH)3 dissolves. But if some remains undissolved, then the H+ is not all consumed. But the problem states that we're dissolving it, so perhaps it's assumed that all Fe(OH)3 reacts, and the H+ from HCl is just enough for that.

So, in that case, the solution is the saturated solution of FeCl3, with no excess HCl. So the H+ comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

In that case, the [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M, and the H+ is due to hydrolysis as calculated earlier, leading to pH ≈2.27. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 100 cm³, and the HCl is added to make that volume. So, the HCl volume is V, and the final solution is 100 cm³. So, the moles of HCl added is 0.1 M * V (in liters) = 0.1 * V/1000 = 0.01 * V (mol).

But according to the reaction, the moles of HCl needed are 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

So, 0.01 * V = 0.002807 → V = 0.2807 liters → 280.7 cm³. But that's impossible because the solution is 100 cm³. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. The HCl is 0.1 M; M is mol/L. So, volume in liters multiplied by 0.1 gives moles.

So, moles = 0.1 * (V_in_liters).

We need moles = 0.002807.

So, V = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.

So that's correct, and the volume is about 28 cm³, which matches option C.

But then the pH is about 2.27, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the FeCl3 solution is in 100 cm³, so after adding the HCl, the volume is 100 cm³. So the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009358 / 0.1 = 0.009358 M.

Now, considering the hydrolysis, perhaps I should use the formula for a weak acid.

Wait, Fe³+ is a weak acid (it hydrolyzes to produce H+). So, the concentration of H+ can be calculated using the formula for a weak acid:

[H+] = sqrt( (3 C α) ), where C is concentration and α is the hydrolysis constant.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that [H+] = 3√(K * C), where K is the hydrolysis constant and C is the concentration of Fe³+.

But earlier, I found K_hydrolysis ≈ 1.667e-5.

So,

[H+] = cube root( K_hydrolysis * C )

= cube_root(1.667e-5 * 0.009358)

= cube_root(1.5625e-7) ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.268.

So, approximately pH 2.27.

But the options don't have this value. The closest option is C, which is pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the K_hydrolysis is different. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: perhaps the hydrolysis can be treated as a reaction where each Fe³+ produces 3 H+.

The hydrolysis constant K can be calculated using the relation between Ksp and the hydrolysis.

Wait, another approach: the solubility of Fe(OH)3 in water is low, but when dissolved in acid, the Fe³+ can hydrolyze as follows.

The hydrolysis can be considered as:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 / [Fe³+}.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, [Fe(OH)3] is a constant, so K = ([H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

We can write this as:

[H+]^3 = K * [Fe³+}.

We need to find K.

From the Ksp expression:

Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

But in the solution, [OH^-] = Kw/[H+}.

So,

Ksp = [Fe³+} * (Kw/[H+})^3.

Rearranging,

[H+]^3 = (Kw^3 * [Fe³+}) / Ksp.

So,

[H+] = cube_root( (Kw^3 * [Fe³+}) / Ksp ).

Plugging in the numbers:

Kw = 1e-14,

Ksp = 6e-38,

[Fe³+] = 0.009358 M.

So,

[H+] = cube_root( ( (1e-14)^3 * 0.009358 ) / 6e-38 )

Calculate numerator: (1e-42) * 0.009358 ≈ 9.358e-45.

Denominator: 6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (9.358e-45) / (6e-38) ) = (9.358 /6 ) * 1e-7 ≈ 1.5597e-7.

So,

[H+] = cube_root( 1.5597e-7 ) ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

Which leads to the same pH of ~2.27. But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think: perhaps the initial assumption that the solution is 100 cm³ but the HCl is added as 28 cm³, making the total solution volume 100 cm³. So the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M.

But perhaps the H+ comes not only from hydrolysis but also from the excess HCl. Wait, no, because we added exactly the stoichiometric amount of HCl, so no excess H+ remains.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the Fe³+ hydrolysis produces H+, which increases the [H+], so the pH is lower than 7. But none of the options have around 2.27.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

Option B: 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69.

Option A: 32.14 cm³ and pH 3.16.

Option D: 20.40 cm³ and pH 4.94.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_hydrolysis calculation. Let me think again about K.

Wait, perhaps the K for the hydrolysis is ( Kw^3 ) / Ksp.

Yes, that's what I had earlier. So,

K = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-38 = 1e-42 /6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = 1.6667e-5.

So, K is 1.6667e-5.

Then,

[H+]^3 = K * [Fe³+} = 1.6667e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.5625e-7.

Cube root is ~5.38e-3, pH ~2.27.

Hmm. None of the options match. Perhaps the given options have a mistake, but I'm probably missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution isn't just the FeCl3 solution but also has H+ from the excess HCl. But in this case, we added exactly the required amount of HCl, so no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid. FeCl3 dissociates into Fe³+ and Cl^-.

Cl^- is the conjugate base of HCl, a strong acid, so it doesn't hydrolyze. So, the pH is determined solely by Fe³+ hydrolysis.

But according to my calculations, the pH should be around 2.27. But the closest option is C (2.04), which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or other factors, but that's probably beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_hydrolysis calculation. Let me think: K_hydrolysis = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = ([Fe(OH)3][H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

But [Fe(OH)3] is a solid, so it's a constant, let's call it S. So,

K = (S [H+]^3) / [Fe³+}.

But from Ksp,

Ksp = [Fe³+} [OH^-]^3.

And [OH^-] = Kw / [H+}.

So,

Ksp = [Fe³+} (Kw / [H+})^3.

Rearranging,

[Fe³+} = Ksp [H+]^3 / Kw^3.

Substituting into K:

K = (S [H+]^3) / ( Ksp [H+]^3 / Kw^3 ) )

= (S Kw^3 ) / Ksp.

So, K = (S Kw^3 ) / Ksp.

But S is the solubility of Fe(OH)3, which is related to Ksp. Solubility S is given by S = (Ksp)^(1/4) * (10^something), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps S is (Ksp)^(1/4), because for a compound like Fe(OH)3, which dissociates into 1 Fe³+ and 3 OH^-, the solubility S is given by S = (Ksp)^(1/(n+m)), where n is the number of cations and m the number of anions. So here, n=1, m=3, so S = (Ksp)^(1/4).

But Ksp = 6e-38, so S = (6e-38)^(1/4) ≈ (6^(1/4)) * 1e-9.5 ≈ 1.565 * 1e-9.5.

Wait, 1e-9.5 is approximately 3.16e-10.

So, S ≈ 1.565 * 3.16e-10 ≈ 4.95e-10 mol/L.

Wait, but that's the solubility in pure water, which is much lower than the concentration we have in the solution (0.009358 M). So, under the given conditions, Fe³+ doesn't precipitate, and the hydrolysis is significant.

So, substituting S into K:

K = (4.95e-10) * (1e-14)^3 / 6e-38.

Wait, let's compute this:

(4.95e-10) * (1e-42) = 4.95e-52.

Divide by 6e-38:

4.95e-52 / 6e-38 = 8.25e-15.

So, K ≈ 8.25e-15.

Wait, that's a much smaller K than I had before. So,

K ≈ 8.25e-15.

Then,

[H+]^3 = K * [Fe³+} = 8.25e-15 * 0.009358 ≈ 7.72e-17.

[H+] = cube_root(7.72e-17) ≈ 9.2e-6 M.

pH = -log(9.2e-6) ≈ 5.04.

Hmm, that's around pH 5.04, which is close to option D's pH of 4.94. But wait, the volume for option D is 20.40 cm³, which doesn't match our earlier calculation of 28 cm³.

But this suggests that the pH would be around 5.04, which is not matching any of the options except perhaps D, but the volume doesn't align.

I'm getting confused because different approaches are giving different pH values. Let me try to think differently.

Another approach: perhaps the solution after adding HCl and dissolving Fe(OH)3 has excess HCl, leading to a lower pH.

Wait, no. Because if we add exactly the stoichiometric amount, there's no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that the solution is 100 cm³. Let me re-express the problem.

The problem states that the solution is made up to a total volume of 100 cm³. So, when adding HCl, the final volume is 100 cm³.

So, the moles of HCl added is 0.1 M * (V / 1000), where V is the volume in cm³.

But the reaction requires 3 * 0.0009358 mol HCl.

So,

0.1 * (V / 1000) = 0.002807 → V = 28.07 cm³.

So, the volume is correct.

Now, considering the solution after reaction: the Fe³+ is dissolved, and the solution is made up to 100 cm³. The H+ comes from Fe³+ hydrolysis.

But earlier calculations gave a pH of around 2.27, which isn't an option. So perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 100 cm³, and the Fe³+ concentration is 0.009358 M. Let me calculate the pH using the hydrolysis expression.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+:

Fe³+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

Let x be the concentration of Fe³+ that reacts. Then,

[Fe³+] = 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358 (if x is small).

[H+] = 3x.

The K expression is K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe³+}.

Plugging in,

K = ( (3x)^3 ) / (0.009358 - x ) ≈ (27 x^3 ) / 0.009358.

But K is 1.667e-5.

So,

27 x^3 / 0.009358 = 1.667e-5 → x^3 = (1.667e-5 * 0.009358) / 27.

Compute numerator: 1.667e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.5625e-7.

So,

x^3 = 1.5625e-7 / 27 ≈ 5.787e-9.

x = cube_root(5.787e-9) ≈ 1.795e-3.

So,

[H+] = 3x ≈ 5.385e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.385e-3) ≈ 2.268.

Again, same result. So, the pH is about 2.27.

But none of the options match. Perhaps I'm missing something about the problem statement.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B has 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69. If I used a different K, perhaps the pH would be higher. Let me see what K would give pH 2.69.

pH = 2.69 → [H+] = 10^-2.69 ≈ 2.04e-3 M.

So,

[H+]^3 = (2.04e-3)^3 ≈ 8.5e-9.

Then,

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+} = (8.5e-9) / 0.009358 ≈ 9.09e-7.

So, K ≈9.09e-7.

But earlier, I calculated K as 1.667e-5. 9.09e-7 is about 0.0054 times that. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier K calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct K is 9.09e-7, which would give the pH of 2.69 as in option B.

But why would K be 9.09e-7?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K calculation earlier. Let me re-calculate K.

K = (Kw^3) / Ksp.

Kw = 1e-14,

Ksp =6e-38.

So,

K = (1e-42) / 6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = 1.6667e-5.

That's correct. So, unless I have the wrong Ksp value.

Wait, perhaps the Ksp I used is incorrect. Let me check the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Upon checking, I recall that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6 × 10^-38, which is what I used.

Hmm. So, unless I'm using the wrong K, I don't see why the pH would be 2.69.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that some Fe(OH)3 remains undissolved, and thus some H+ remains from the excess HCl. But the problem states that we are to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, implying that it's completely dissolved.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the hydrolysis and only consider the excess H+ from the strong acid. But in that case, if we add exactly the stoichiometric amount, there's no excess H+.

Wait, but perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and the solution requires considering the excess H+.

Let me think: perhaps the problem wants us to calculate the volume of HCl needed to ensure complete dissolution, which may require more than the stoichiometric amount, allowing some excess H+ that contributes to the pH.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum volume needed to dissolve, which would be the stoichiometric volume, with no excess H+.

But let me try adding a bit more HCl and see what happens.

Suppose we add V cm³ of HCl, where V is a bit more than 28.07 cm³. Let's say V =30 cm³.

Moles of HCl = 0.1 * 30/1000 = 0.003 mol.

Moles needed: 0.002807 mol.

Excess H+ = 0.003 - 0.002807 = 0.000193 mol.

Total volume is 100 cm³, so [H+] excess = 0.000193 / 0.1 = 0.00193 M.

But this would contribute to the pH.

But in addition, Fe³+ would hydrolyze, contributing more H+.

So,

[H+] = sqrt( ([H+]_excess)^2 + ( [H+]_hydrolysis )^2 )

But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the excess H+ is negligible compared to the H+ from hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to calculate.

If V=30 cm³,

HCl added = 0.003 mol.

Reaction consumes 0.002807 mol HCl, leaving 0.000193 mol H+.

So, [H+] from excess = 0.000193 / 0.1 = 0.00193 M.

Fe³+ concentration: 0.009358 M.

H+ from hydrolysis: 5.38e-3 M.

Total [H+] ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

pH ≈ 2.27, same as before. So, the excess H+ doesn't significantly affect the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the hydrolysis and only consider the excess H+ from HCl. But in that case, adding exactly the stoichiometric amount would result in pH 7, which isn't possible because Fe³+ is present.

I'm stuck. Given the options, the correct volume is 28.05 cm³, which is option C. The pH, according to my calculations, should be around 2.27, but the closest option is C's pH of 2.04.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_hydrolysis calculation. Let me re-calculate K.

K_hydrolysis = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kw^3 =1e-42.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38.

So,

K_hydrolysis =1e-42 /6e-38 = (1/6)*1e-4 = 1.6667e-5.

Yes, correct.

So, [H+]^3 =1.6667e-5 * 0.009358 ≈1.56e-7.

Cube root is ~5.38e-3 → pH ~2.27.

But none of the options match. Unless I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Mass =0.1 g.

Molar mass: Fe=55.85, O=16*3=48, H=1*3=3. Total:55.85+48+3=106.85 g/mol.

Moles = 0.1 /106.85 ≈0.0009358 mol.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm not seeing a mistake in the calculations. It seems that the correct pH is approximately 2.27, but the options don't have this. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, with pH 2.04, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use a different approach, such as considering the solution as a buffer, but I don't think that applies here.

Given the time I've spent and the calculations I've done, I think the correct answer is option C: 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04, but I'm not entirely confident about the pH value.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a monobasic strong acid (e.g., HCl) is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + (16 + 1) \times 3 = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.0009358 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine moles of H⁺ required
From the balanced reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺. Thus, the moles of H⁺ required are:
\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.0009358 \approx 0.002807 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M HCl needed
The volume of HCl required is given by:
\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Molarity of HCl}} = \frac{0.002807}{0.1} = 0.02807 \, \text{L} = 28.07 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the pH of the resulting solution
After dissolving Fe(OH)₃, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+.
\]
The hydrolysis constant \( K \) is related to the solubility product (\( K_{\text{sp}} \)) and \( K_w \):
\[
K = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{\text{sp}}}.
\]
Given \( K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14} \) and \( K_{\text{sp}} = 6 \times 10^{-38} \), we calculate:
\[
K = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-14})^3}{6 \times 10^{-38}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-42}}{6 \times 10^{-38}} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the solution is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe}^{3+}}{\text{Volume of solution}} = \frac{0.0009358}{0.1} = 0.009358 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the hydrolysis equilibrium:
\[
K = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]},
\]
we solve for \([\text{H}^+]\):
\[
[\text{H}^+]^3 = K \cdot [\text{Fe}^{3+}] = (1.667 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot (0.009358) \approx 1.5625 \times 10^{-7}.
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] = \sqrt[3]{1.5625 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.38 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH is then:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log_{10}([\text{H}^+]) = -\log_{10}(5.38 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.27.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: pH 3.16, 32.14 cm³. The volume is too high, and the pH is inconsistent with calculations.
- **Option B**: pH 2.69, 30.09 cm³. The volume is higher than the calculated minimum, and the pH is slightly higher than expected.
- **Option C**: pH 2.04, 28.05 cm³. The volume matches the calculated minimum (28.07 cm³), and the pH is close to the calculated value (2.27).
- **Option D**: pH 4.94, 20.40 cm³. The volume is too low, and the pH is far too high.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option C**, as it provides the minimum volume of HCl (28.05 cm³) and a pH (2.04) that is reasonably close to the calculated value (2.27).

Answer: C
