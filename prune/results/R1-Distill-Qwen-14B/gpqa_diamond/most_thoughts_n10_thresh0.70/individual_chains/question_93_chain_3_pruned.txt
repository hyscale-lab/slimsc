Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran it on serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. So the results show the Ct values for each concentration.

The question is asking why there are discrepancies in his results, and the options are A to D.

First, I remember that qPCR quantification relies on the relationship between the starting quantity of nucleic acids and the Ct value. The formula I recall is something like Ct = Ct0 - (slope * log(Q)), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Oh right, the standard formula is log(Q) = (Ct - Ct0) / slope, where Ct0 is the intercept. Wait, no, I think it's actually Q = 10^((Ct0 - Ct)/slope) or something like that. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as log(Q) = (Ct0 - Ct) * (1/slope). Hmm, but the details might not matter immediately.

The efficiency is 100%, which I think is perfect because qPCR efficiency ideally is around 100%, meaning each cycle doubles the DNA. So if efficiency is 100%, the relationship between starting quantity and Ct should be perfect, leading to a linear plot when using log-transformed data. The R² of 1 confirms that the data fits perfectly, so it's a good calibration curve.

Now, looking at the data. The scientist has concentrations from 100,000 down to 10 copies per µl, each diluted tenfold. The Ct values are as follows:

100,000: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
10,000: 30.6, etc. → each time, the Ct decreases by about 3.3 each tenfold dilution. Wait, let's check the differences between each concentration's Ct averages.

From 100,000 to 10,000: 33.9 to 30.6 → a difference of 3.3
10,000 to 1,000: 30.6 to 27.3 → 3.3
1,000 to 100: 27.3 to 24 → 3.3
100 to 10: 24 to 20.7 → 3.3

Oh wait, each 10-fold dilution causes a decrease in Ct of exactly 3.3 cycles. That's interesting. But in a perfect scenario, for a 100% efficient PCR, a 10-fold dilution should lead to a decrease of about 3.32 cycles because log2(10) is approximately 3.
