Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the question involves several reactions, and I need to figure out what's happening at each step to determine the final NMR coupling pattern.

First, let's look at the starting material. The first compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe an elimination reaction? Dehydrohalogenation perhaps? So when dibromides are treated with a strong base, they usually eliminate to form alkenes. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons, it should form an alkene.

The product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Wait, but if it's an elimination, wouldn't that form an alkene with a double bond? Oh wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, wait. Wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps it's a di-elimination. Wait, but elimination usually gives alkenes, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait another thought: maybe the reaction is not elimination but a substitution. Wait, adamantane is a structure that's quite rigid, so substitution might be less likely. Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone? Oh wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Dibromide reacting with KOH could form an epoxide if the starting material was a vicinal dihalide. But no, epoxides form from epoxidation, which usually involves peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's elimination to form a diene, but that might not explain the IR.

Wait, maybe the product is an ethylene glycol derivative. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl, so maybe the elimination forms a ketone? Wait, but how?

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a double elimination. Each Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons form double bonds. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose HBr twice, forming a diene? But then why the IR peak at 1720? Unless... Wait, perhaps it's a different structure. Oh wait, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, which upon elimination would form a double bond, but then maybe a subsequent reaction?

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, if the structure is such that the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br at positions 1 and 3. If both Br atoms are eliminated, perhaps the structure would form a bridge, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantanedione? No, that can't be right because the starting material is di-bromo, so elimination would form a double bond, not a ketone. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle: looking at the NMR of product 1. The given 1H NMR spectrum has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The peak at 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH group, but wait, in D2O it would exchange. Or maybe it's an -O- group. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That might be a CH2 next to an oxygen. For example, an ether or an ester.

Wait, IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So, maybe product 1 is an ester or a ketone. But how does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. KOH is a strong base, but in a dibromide, maybe it's a double substitution. Wait, but that would give a diol, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait another thought: Maybe the KOH is acting as a base, causing elimination. So the dibromide would lose two HBr molecules, resulting in an alkene. But wait, then why is the IR showing a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide. Wait, but for epoxide formation, we usually use a peracid, not KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Hmm...

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, but I'm not seeing the mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing the formation of a dioxolane or similar. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether.

Wait, maybe it's a pinacol-type elimination. Pinacol is when a 1,2-diol loses water to form a carbonyl. But here we have a dihalide. Wait, in the pinacol mechanism, the diol loses two water molecules to form a ketone. So, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base, causing elimination of two HX molecules (like HBr) to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but in that case, the starting material would have two leaving groups on adjacent carbons, each bonded to hydroxyl groups. But in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so two Br atoms on adjacent positions. So, perhaps the base (KOH) abstracts a proton beta to each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. But that brings us back to forming an alkene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, but what if the structure of adamantane leads to the elimination of two HBr molecules and the formation of a carbonyl group? Let me think. If the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and each is eliminated with a base abstracting a proton from each adjacent carbon, then the two carbons would form a double bond. Wait, but that would just give an alkene, not a carbonyl. Unless something else happens.

Wait, perhaps it's an oxidative cleavage. Oh wait, but the reaction is with KOH, which is a strong base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but I don't see how that would form from a dibromide with KOH.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, would form a diepoxide. But no, that requires an epoxidizing agent like mCPBA.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the reaction is a double elimination forming a carbonyl. So, each Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group. But how?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR data again. The 4.79 ppm peak (2H) could be a CH2 next to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely from the adamantane structure, maybe some CH2 groups. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2. Maybe the structure is an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diol. But if it's a diol, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diketone. Wait, then two Br atoms would have been replaced by ketones. But how? I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the IR peak. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the NMR doesn't show any aldehyde protons (which would be around 9-10 ppm), so probably not an aldehyde. Carboxylic acids would have broad peaks around 1-2 ppm, but again, not matching.

Wait, an ester would show a carbonyl around 1720, but then the structure would have an ester group. How could that form from the dibromide? Maybe through a substitution reaction, but with what?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double substitution with a base. But KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. If the dibromide undergoes two SN2 reactions, perhaps substituting Br with OH groups, forming a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the product is an epoxide. Let me think: 1,3-dibromo could form an epoxide if the base induces a ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product is a ketone resulting from the elimination of two HBr molecules. How?

Wait, if the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when two HBr molecules are eliminated, a carbonyl group is formed. For instance, each elimination forms a double bond, but perhaps in this case, the two eliminations lead to a carbonyl. But I don't see a clear mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diepoxide, but that would require an oxidizing agent, which I don't think is present here.

I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let's think about the possible structures. The IR has a carbonyl, and the NMR has 2H at around 4.79 ppm. That might indicate an -OCH₂- group, like in an ether or ester. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide, but the NMR doesn't fit well. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether. For example, a three-membered ring. Epoxides have protons around 3-4 ppm, but in this case, it's 4.79. Hmm, not a perfect fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is a gem-diol. But that would be a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl in IR.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketone with adjacent CH2 groups. The 4.79 ppm could be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetal or ketal structure, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ketone. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is forming a diradical or some other structure, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Hmm, perhaps I should move to the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is something with a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, perhaps product 2 is undergoing some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and heating with a Lewis acid would cause it to undergo some reaction, like cleavage. But without knowing product 1, it's hard to say.

Wait, but maybe product 1 is a diol. If product 1 is a diol, then treating with Al(OiPr)3 might lead to some kind of acetylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for ring-opening. Then product 2 would be an alcohol or something else.

But I'm not making much progress. Let's think about the next step: product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

After ozonolysis, product 3 is formed. Then, in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding exchangeables) has a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, the most deshielded hydrogen would typically be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So after ozonolysis, the product would have carbonyl groups, so any protons adjacent to them would be deshielded.

Looking at the options, the coupling pattern could be a triplet, triplet of triplets, etc. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, perhaps the initial product 1 is a cyclic ether. Let's say it's an epoxide. Then product 2 might be something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then product 2 would be the same, but maybe with some modification.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the steps again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Assuming KOH is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton adjacent to each Br, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane? But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl peak. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's substitution. But substitution of Br with OH would give a diol, but then no carbonyl in IR.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is more like a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, that would require the formation of a carbonyl from a dihalide. How?

Ah! Wait, perhaps it's a case of the Corey-Fuchs reaction, but I'm not familiar with that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone via a two-step elimination.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. Each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br, so eliminating both would form a conjugated diene. Hmm, but no carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that the IR peak is from an ester. So, product 1 is an ester. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution where Br is replaced by an O-linked group. If KOH is used, maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis? But for that, you need an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Hmm, but in this case, it's a dihalide. So perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen group. But I'm not sure how that would lead to an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would give a diol, which doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think about the product 1 structure based on NMR.

The NMR has 4.79 (2H). Maybe this is an -OCH2- group, as in an ether. Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be multiple CH2 groups from the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) might be another CH2.

If product 1 is an epoxide, the NMR would have a triplet for the epoxide protons around 3-4 ppm, but here it's 4.79. So maybe it's an ether, not an epoxide.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, the -OH protons would show broad peaks, but in the given data, there's a peak at 4.79 which is probably not an -OH. So maybe it's an ether.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. But then the 4.79 ppm would be something else.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a secondary alcohol. The 4.79 could be the -OH group, but then the IR would have a broad peak, which isn't mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a geminal diol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a di-substituted ether. But I'm not making progress here. Let's try to move to the next steps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, but product 1 would need an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Then, ozonolysis would break a double bond.

Wait, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and the protons adjacent to them would be deshielded.

Now, the most deshielded proton in product 3 would be near a carbonyl. Let's imagine product 3 has a carbonyl group next to a CH2 group. The CH2 protons would couple with neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone, with each carbonyl adjacent to a CH2 group. The protons on these CH2 groups would be deshielded due to being next to the carbonyl.

In such a scenario, each CH2 would have two protons. These protons would couple with the adjacent CH2 protons. But wait, if the structure is a chain like (CH₂)₂(C=O), then each CH₂ would have protons that are next to each other. Let's think about the coupling.

If the structure is (CH₂)₂(C=O), then each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂. So each proton on the first CH₂ would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. That would lead to a triplet of triplets, perhaps? Because each proton would see two neighboring protons, each split into a triplet, but wait, that's for coupling with two different sets.

Wait, let's think clearly. Suppose we have a structure like CH₂CH₂(C=O)R. Each proton on the first CH₂ would be adjacent to two protons on the second CH₂. So each proton would have coupling with two equivalent protons. So each proton would split into a triplet. But if the two coupling constants are the same, the total splitting would be a triplet. However, if the two adjacent CH₂ groups are connected in a way that each CH₂'s protons are coupled to both ends, perhaps the splitting becomes more complex.

Wait, another scenario: suppose the ozonolysis produces two carbonyl groups on either end of a chain, and the remaining part is a CH₂ group in the middle. For example, if product 3 is something like (CH₂)₂(C=O)₂, then each CH₂ is adjacent to two protons on each side. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diacid or a diketone, with the CH₂ groups in the center. Let's say the structure is O=C-(CH₂)₂-C=O. Then, the central CH₂ would be between two carbonyl groups. The protons on these CH₂ would be next to each other and coupled to each other. Each would couple with two protons (the two on the adjacent CH₂), but since they're equivalent, perhaps it's a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, then each CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂. The central CH₂'s protons would be split by the neighboring CH₂ protons. So each H on the first CH₂ is next to two H on the next CH₂. So each H would be split into a triplet. But if the coupling is between adjacent CH₂ groups, perhaps the splitting is a doublet of doublets or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with a structure like (CH₂)₂ between two ketones. So the CH₂ groups are each next to a ketone. Each CH₂ would have two protons, each coupling with the adjacent CH₂'s protons.

In this case, each proton on the central CH₂ would be coupled to two others. So each would split into a triplet. But wait, considering the neighboring group, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out. Let's say the molecule is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. The two CH₂ groups are in the middle. Each CH₂ has two protons. The protons on the first CH₂ are adjacent to the protons on the second CH₂. So each proton on the first CH₂ is split by the two protons on the second CH₂, which would result in a triplet (n+1, where n=2, so triplet). Similarly, the protons on the second CH₂ are split by the first CH₂'s protons, also leading to triplets.

But wait, in this case, each CH₂ is flanked by a carbonyl group. So the most deshielded protons would be the ones closest to the carbonyl. Wait, but in this structure, all the CH₂ protons are adjacent to carbonyls.

Wait, but the question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So perhaps the most deshielded is the one closest to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the ozonolysis produces a molecule where a CH₂ group is next to the carbonyl, and that CH₂ is adjacent to another CH₂.

In that case, each proton on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂. So each would split into a triplet.

But depending on the structure, the coupling could be more complex. For instance, if the CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ which is adjacent to another group, the coupling might involve multiple neighbors.

Wait, another possibility: if the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, then the central CH₂ would have neighbors on both sides. Each proton on the central CH₂ would couple with the two on the adjacent CH₂ groups. So each would have (n=2 + 2)=4 neighbors, leading to a pentet. But that's if all the coupling constants are similar. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH₂ is only adjacent to one other CH₂. For example, O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, with the central CH₂-CH₂. Each CH₂'s protons would be split by the adjacent CH₂'s two protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in that case, each CH₂'s protons would be a triplet. So the most deshielded would be the ones next to the carbonyl. Their coupling would be with the adjacent CH₂'s two protons, so triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet. So perhaps that's the answer.

Wait, but let's think again. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone with a CH₂ group in between. The CH₂ protons would be adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, another point: the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So, the CH₂ next to the carbonyl would have protons that are more deshielded. Each of these protons would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂, resulting in a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet. Hence, the answer would be option A.

But wait, another possibility arises. If the structure is such that the CH₂ group is between two carbonyls, each CH₂ proton is adjacent to two protons on each side. So, each proton would have four neighboring protons (two on each adjacent CH₂ group). But that's unlikely because each CH₂ only has two protons. So perhaps each CH₂ is between two carbonyls and another CH₂.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O. So each CH₂ is flanked by a carbonyl on one side and another CH₂ on the other. Each CH₂ proton would be adjacent to two protons from the neighboring CH₂. So each would split into a triplet.

Thus, the most deshielded proton (on the CH₂ next to the carbonyl) would show a triplet coupling pattern.

So the answer would be option A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is treated with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH, being a strong base, likely induces two successive eliminations of HBr, forming a conjugated diene. However, the IR spectrum of the product shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction does not stop at the diene stage but proceeds further. The most plausible outcome is the formation of a diketone, where the two carbonyl groups are positioned on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

2. **NMR Analysis of Product 1**  
   The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The peak at 4.79 ppm likely corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group, while the other peaks are consistent with the adamantane structure. This supports the formation of a diketone.

3. **Step 2: Reaction with Aluminum Isopropoxide**  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in reactions involving carbonyl compounds. This step likely leads to the formation of product 2, which may involve rearrangement or further modification of the diketone structure.

4. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. If product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.

5. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring protons. If the structure of product 3 is a diketone with a CH₂ group flanked by carbonyl groups (e.g., O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O), the protons on the CH₂ groups would couple with the adjacent CH₂ protons. Each proton on the CH₂ group would experience coupling with two protons on the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern.

6. **Conclusion**  
   Based on the reaction sequence and the coupling pattern analysis, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a triplet coupling pattern.

**Answer: A**
