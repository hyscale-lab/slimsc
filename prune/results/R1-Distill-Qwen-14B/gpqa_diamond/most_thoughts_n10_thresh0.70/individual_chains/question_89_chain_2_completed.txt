Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's going on step by step. Hmm, it's about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. 

The first step says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given for product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break this down.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very similar to diamond but with a more crystalline structure. The 1,3-dibromo compound has bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. 

Heating with KOH probably leads to an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it should deprotonate something. Wait, but in this case, since it's dibromide, maybe it's an E2 elimination. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three other carbons and one substituent. So, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon? Hmm. Wait, no, adamantane's structure is such that each bridgehead carbon is connected to three others, so when those are substituted with Br, elimination would likely form a double bond.

Wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons that are opposite each other? Or perhaps adjacent? Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons arranged in a chair-like structure. If the compound is 1,3-dibromo, then the two Br atoms are on carbons that are two positions apart? Or maybe across from each other. Anyway, when treated with a strong base like KOH, perhaps elimination occurs, forming a double bond between those two carbons.

Wait, when two bromides are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, elimination would form a bridged double bond. So maybe the product is 1,3-diamantadiene. But wait, when two bromides are on adjacent bridgeheads, elimination would form a double bond between them. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's a diamondoid structure where each bridgehead is a CH2Br group, maybe? Or perhaps each bridgehead is a CBr group connected to two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. The structure of adamantane is such that each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three CH2 groups. So in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bridgehead carbons have Br substituents. So, when KOH is added, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond between those two bridgehead carbons. So the product would be a diene, perhaps an adamantadiene.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or possibly an ester. Wait, but elimination would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. With two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps it's undergoing an SN2 reaction with KOH. But SN2 in such a rigid structure might not be feasible. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, leading to the formation of an oxide or an epoxide? No, wait, that's for alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. That suggests that the reaction is not elimination but something else. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by keto-enol tautomerism or something else. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing an elimination to form a ketone. Wait, that can't be right because elimination typically forms alkenes or alkynes.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening or some kind of substitution to form a ketone. Hmm. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH at high temperature. Another possibility is that it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's more for amines. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would give a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretching. Wait, the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, such as a ketone or ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a ketone. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes. Another thought: perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, perhaps the initial elimination forms a diene (which would have a double bond), but then some rearrangement forms a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. Wait, how? Let's think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent bridgeheads. KOH might abstract a β-hydrogen from each, leading to the formation of two double bonds? Or perhaps one double bond between the two bridgeheads, but that would require losing two HBr molecules.

Wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead carbon is connected to three CH2 groups. So if you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each bridgehead has a Br. When KOH is added, each bridgehead loses HBr, perhaps forming a double bond between them. So the product would have a double bond between C1 and C3, making a bicyclic diene. But wait, how would that give a carbonyl group in product 1?

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Heated with KOH, maybe it's a Fittig reaction? No, that's for aryl halides. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would form a peroxide or something else. Not sure.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a diketone. How would that happen? Let me think about the structure. If each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group, but that would require two substitutions. But wait, KOH is a strong base; perhaps it's undergoing a double elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, which then gets oxidized. But I don't see an oxidizing agent here. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some oxidation. But the problem doesn't mention any oxidizing conditions after elimination.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination but something else. Oh! Maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination forming a double bond, and the product has a conjugated diene. But then how does that lead to a carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the initial product is a diene, and then upon some reaction, it forms a ketone. But in the given data, product 1 is formed directly, so the IR peak must come from product 1.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it undergoes a double intramolecular elimination, forming a ring. Like, in a six-membered ring, perhaps forming a cyclohexenone. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a bridge where the two Br atoms are eliminated, forming a bridgehead double bond, and then perhaps some rearrangement.

Wait, another angle: The NMR spectrum of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is a singlet integrating for 2H. Singlet suggests that the two protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring Hs. So maybe they are on an oxygen, like an ether. Wait, but IR doesn't show O-H stretch. Alternatively, it could be on a carbonyl group, but then they wouldn't be protons.

Alternatively, maybe those 2H are adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Wait, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an acetate group. But the IR peak is at 1720, which could be an ester or ketone. Wait, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1740. If it's a ketone, around 1720. So perhaps the product is a ketone.

In that case, the 1H NMR would show the ketone's neighboring protons. Let me think about the structure. Suppose the product is a ketone in the adamantane structure. So maybe the two bridgehead Brs are replaced by a carbonyl group. Wait, but two Br substitutions would require two reactions, but in the starting material, there are two Br atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But that would require each bridgehead to have a carbonyl, which might not be feasible due to the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a single ketone, but I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, so maybe it's a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. But wait, if it's attached to an oxygen, perhaps it's an epoxide? But then the IR would show a characteristic peak around 1250 cm-1 for the epoxide, which isn't mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, another thought: if the product is a bicyclic ketone, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is the methylene adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, in a structure like (CH2)2CO. The CH2 groups next to the carbonyl typically appear around 2.1-2.5 ppm as a quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. But in this case, the singlet at 4.79 suggests it's two equivalent protons, not split by neighboring Hs. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet comes from an ethylene group, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Wait, but the IR does show a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is a -OCH2O- group, like in a cyclic ether. But again, the IR would show different peaks.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not a ketone but something else. Let me think again about the reaction. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could lead to elimination, forming a double bond. So perhaps product 1 is an alkene. Then, the NMR would show peaks corresponding to the alkene protons. But the IR's 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, which wouldn't be present in an alkene. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. When Br is replaced by OH, but then the IR would show O-H absorption. But the data doesn't mention that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone or an ester. Considering the starting material is a dibromide, perhaps it's undergoing a double elimination to form a diketone. So each Br is replaced by a carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that happen? Elimination usually forms alkenes. Maybe in this case, it's forming a cycloketone via a double elimination. For example, if two HBr molecules are eliminated, forming a ring with a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone adamantane. So each bridgehead Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single ketone formed by the elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a bridgehead double bond and then some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If each Br is replaced by an O- group, but then that would form a peroxide or something else. But the IR doesn't show O-H. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution where each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would form a diol.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantane-1,3-dione. That would explain the carbonyl in the IR. So product 1 is a diketone. So each Br in 1,3-dibromoadamantane is replaced by a carbonyl group via a substitution reaction.

But wait, substitution of Br with what? KOH provides OH- as a nucleophile. So perhaps each Br is replaced by a hydroxyl group, but that would form a diol. However, diols don't have a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's more of an elimination followed by oxidation? But the problem states that product 1 is formed directly upon heating with KOH.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the NMR again. The singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe it's a -CH2-O- group in an epoxide, but from the structure, I'm not sure.

Another approach: perhaps the product is a gem-diol. But that would require the two Brs being on the same carbon, which they're not. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. But then the IR would show the epoxide peak, which is around 1250 cm-1, which I don't think is present here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. The only way for that to happen from a dibromide is if the two Brs are eliminated, but that would form a double bond unless there's some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone, where the elimination forms a bridge with a carbonyl group. For example, in a bridged bicyclic structure, where the two bridgehead carbons are now connected via a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a ketone to begin with, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group. So, each Br is removed as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl. That would require each carbon to lose H and Br, leading to a double bond. Wait, but that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Let's consider that the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl in the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not formed via elimination but through substitution. If each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group via some mechanism. But how? Maybe via a Corey-Fuchs reaction? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but adamantane isn't aromatic.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol, but again, the IR doesn't show O-H. Unless it's a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diester. But that would require an ester group, which would have a carbonyl. The IR would show around 1740 cm-1, which is higher than 1720, so perhaps it's a ketone.

Let me think again. Suppose product 1 is a ketone. The only way to form a ketone from a dibromide is if two HBr molecules are eliminated, and the two carbons bond to each other, forming a double bond, but that's just an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but then how does that form a ketone? Unless there's some subsequent oxidation, but that's not mentioned.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but is a substitution where each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But substitution typically replaces with a nucleophile, not a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone, and the NMR shows the adjacent CH2 groups. Let's imagine the structure. Suppose the ketone is at C1 and C3. Each ketone would have adjacent CH2 groups. So the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. But wait, in a ketone, the adjacent CH2 would typically be around 2.1-2.5 ppm, not 4.79. That's higher, suggesting perhaps an oxygen nearby. So maybe it's like an acetate group, but that would be an ester.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.79 ppm is a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. Like in an ether or an epoxide. For example, if the structure has an -O-CH2-O- group. But in that case, the IR would show the C-O-C peak around 1100 cm-1, which isn't mentioned.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that would require OH groups on the same carbon, which I don't think is the case.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should move to the next step and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. I recall that aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1, whatever it is, would need to react with it. Perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(isopropoxide)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation.

Wait, product 1's IR has a strong peak at 1720, which fits a ketone. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then, treating a ketone with aluminum isopropoxide might lead to some kind of enol formation or perhaps the generation of an acylium ion, which could undergo Friedel-Crafts type reactions. But what's the structure of product 2?

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone and has an α hydrogen, then treatment with a Lewis acid like AlCl3 (or Al(iPr)3) could protonate the enolate, making it more susceptible to Friedel-Crafts. But I'm not sure what product 2 would be.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 could be an enol ether or some kind of enolate. Or perhaps the ketone is alkylated via Friedel-Crafts. But that requires the presence of an aromatic ring, which I don't think is present in adamantane derivatives.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or an acetal. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation product, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is a conjugated enone. Hmm.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene typically cleaves the double bonds and forms carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments.

But the problem states that ozone is bubbled through solution 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. That's a standard ozonolysis workup which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, putting it all together, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, product 2 is an enol or enone, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

Wait, but let me try to piece this together. Let's assume that product 1 is a ketone. Then, when treated with Al(iPr)3, it could form an enol ether or perhaps undergo some kind of ring expansion or contraction. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is a more substituted diene.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about product 2 being an enone. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyls.

So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But given the starting material, perhaps the diene is part of a bridged structure.

Wait, but let's think about the initial steps. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 with KOH. Let's say product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 1 treated with Al(iPr)3 → product 2, perhaps a diene. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3.

So, product 3 would be the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. Then, the NMR of product 3 would show the coupling of the protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, perhaps the most deshielded H is adjacent to a carbonyl group, making it deshielded, and its coupling would depend on neighboring Hs.

Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded H is part of a conjugated system, leading to specific splitting.

Wait, in ozonolysis, each double bond is cleaved into two carbonyls. So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups.

But considering the structure, perhaps product 3 is a dialdehyde or a diketone.

Wait, but in the case of a bridged bicyclic diene, ozonolysis would break the bridge. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the possible structures.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (maybe a diene or ketone)
2. product 1 → Al(iPr)3 → product 2 (possibly a diene or enol ether)
3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (with carbonyl groups)

For the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would likely be near a carbonyl group, so perhaps it's a methylene or methine group next to a carbonyl.

In the NMR, the coupling pattern depends on neighboring Hs. If the H is next to two sets of Hs, it could be a triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, let's think about a simple example. Suppose product 3 is a dialdehyde. The structure could be something like O=CH-CH2-CHO. Then, the central CH2 would be next to two aldehyde Hs, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are split into a doublet. But in this case, the most deshielded H would likely be the aldehyde H, but those are typically split if they have neighboring Hs. But in the case of a dialdehyde, each aldehyde H is next to a CH2 group. Wait, no, in O=CH-CH2-CHO, each aldehyde H is at the end, so they wouldn't have neighboring Hs except perhaps from the adjacent CH2.

Wait, no, the structure would be O=CH-CH2-CHO. The central CH2 is between two O=CH- groups. So each aldehyde H is on a CH group, which is next to a CH2. The H on the aldehyde is deshielded, but in that case, each aldehyde H would be a singlet because they don't have neighboring Hs (the O=CH- group has only one H). Alternatively, if the structure is a cyclic dialdehyde, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone. Then, the Hs adjacent to the ketones would be deshielded. For example, if the structure is (CH2)CO-R-CO(CH2), then each CH2 next to a carbonyl would have neighboring Hs. The CH2 groups would be split based on their neighboring Hs.

Wait, maybe it's a more complex structure. For example, ozonolysis of a bridged diene could form a structure like two ketones connected by a chain. So, the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and perhaps coupled with two sets of Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets or some other multiplet.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. The most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. If it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and each CH2 is next to another CH2, then each H in the CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the central CH2 groups would each have neighboring Hs. Each H in the CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups. So each H would be a quartet due to coupling with two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in this case, the central CH2 would be between two CH2 groups. Each H would be adjacent to two Hs on the left and two on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each H is coupled with two Hs on each neighboring group, perhaps leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, no. Let me think about a simple ethylene oxide. CH2-O-CH2. Each CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet because each H is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So for a CH2-CH2 group, each H is a triplet.

Wait, in the case of a structure like CH2-CO-CHO, the central CH2 would be next to a carbonyl. But the adjacent groups would determine the splitting.

Alternatively, suppose product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of those Hs is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other. So, each H would be split into a triplet from the adjacent CH2, but perhaps also split again by another neighboring group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The CH2 groups in the middle would each have two neighboring Hs on either side. So each H in the middle CH2 groups would be a quartet (coupled with two Hs from each adjacent CH2). So each would be a quartet of quartets, but that's a lot, but perhaps in reality, it's a triplet of triplets, depending on how the coupling constants are.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex. For example, each H in the CH2 is coupled to two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to (n+1)(m+1) where n and m are the number of neighboring Hs. So each H would be a triplet of triplets, making a total of 9 peaks. But that's unlikely to be one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, the choices are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet. So which one fits?

If the H is adjacent to two sets of Hs, each with two Hs, then each coupling would split into triplets. So a triplet of triplets would be the case.

For example, if a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each H in the central CH2 is split by the two Hs on the left and the two on the right. So each H would be a triplet due to coupling with the left CH2, and each of those triplets would be further split into triplets by the right CH2. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH and another CH2, the splitting might be different.

Wait, let's think of a specific structure. Suppose product 3 is a diketone where the carbonyl groups are at each end of a chain. For example:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O

Each of the central CH2 groups would have neighboring Hs. The middle CH2 would be adjacent to two CH2 groups. So each H in the middle would be split by the two Hs on the left and the two on the right. Thus, each H would be a quartet due to coupling with the left CH2, and each of those would be split again by the right CH2, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and one H on the other, leading to a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the options:

Option B: triplet of triplets.
Option C: doublet of triplets.

If the H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, it's a triplet of triplets (option B). If it's coupled with two on one side and one on the other, it would be a doublet of triplets (option C). So which is more likely?

In the case where the H is in the middle of a chain, like CH2-CH2-CH2, each CH2 is adjacent to two CH2 groups. So each H is split by two Hs on the left and two on the right. So each H would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to a CH and a CH2, it would have one and two Hs coupling, leading to a doublet of triplets.

But in the case of ozonolysis of a diene, product 3 would likely have a symmetrical structure. So perhaps the central CH2 groups are each adjacent to two CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Therefore, the most deshielded H would be in a CH2 group adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So its coupling would be a triplet of triplets, option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3, and the question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a conjugated diene. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that product 1 is a diketone, where the two bromine atoms are replaced by carbonyl groups.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Aluminum Isopropoxide**  
   Treatment of the diketone with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates the formation of an enol or enone intermediate (product 2). This step sets up the molecule for further reaction.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2**  
   Ozonolysis of the enol or enone cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 is a dialdehyde or diketone, depending on the structure of product 2.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. If product 3 is a symmetrical diketone or dialdehyde, the central CH₂ group will be flanked by two CH₂ groups. Each hydrogen in the central CH₂ group will couple with two hydrogens on one side and two hydrogens on the other, resulting in a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with only two equivalent hydrogens, but the symmetry of the molecule suggests a more complex splitting pattern.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This matches the expected splitting for a hydrogen in the central CH₂ group, coupled with two hydrogens on each adjacent CH₂ group.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen coupled with one set of two hydrogens and another set of three hydrogens, which is inconsistent with the expected structure.  
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not supported by the structure.

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 exhibits a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern due to its position in the molecule and the neighboring hydrogens. 

ANSWER: B
