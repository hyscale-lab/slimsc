Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then determining the product after a series of reactions. The options are from A to D. Let me break this down.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 + 2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2= (9)/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right because degrees should be whole numbers. Oh wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, for unsaturation: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. Each ring or double bond gives one, each triple bond gives two, etc.

So five degrees could be a ring and some double bonds. Or maybe like a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds and a ring, so 4 degrees) plus a double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high ppm, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes appear around 9-10 ppm. So that's likely the aldehyde group.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H). Another peak at 6.51 (d, 2H). These are probably from a di-substituted aromatic ring. Like para-substituted benzene, because the two doublets each integrate 2H. So each is a pair of H's in a para position.

Then, 6.27 (bs, 2H). A broad singlet, maybe for some protons that are either next to an oxygen or part of an enol structure, maybe. Broad suggests exchange, like in an acidic environment, maybe an enol or something adjacent to an oxygen.

And 3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet integrating for 2H. That looks like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. So maybe an OCH2 group, but the splitting suggests two neighboring protons. Wait, but OCH2 would be split into a quartet if next to another CH2. Hmm. Or perhaps it's a CH2 attached to something else, like a carbonyl or another oxygen.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring (from the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks), an aldehyde group (9.72), and some substituents with OCH2 or something.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene is 6C, so there's 2 more carbons. Let's see: the aldehyde is CHO, so that's one C. Then maybe an O group, another substituent.

Wait, maybe the molecule has two benzene rings attached? No, because C8H9NO is only 8 carbons, but benzene is 6, so perhaps one substituent is a benzene ring, and the other substituents are something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a diphenyl compound. Let's see: two benzene rings would be 12 carbons, which is too much. So no, perhaps only one benzene ring.

Wait, let me think again. The molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's count the possible structure. Maybe a benzaldehyde derivative. So, for example, something like phenyl group attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde and some oxygen-containing groups.

Looking at the NMR again: the aldehyde proton at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which suggests it has two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't have neighboring Hs unless in a specific structure. Hmm, maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like an enal. Or perhaps a vinyl aldehyde.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 ppm with 1H: that's a bit unusual. Wait, maybe it's a ketone instead? No, because the chemical shift is too high for a ketone. Unless it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to another proton group, such as in a CH2CHO group. But then, the aldehyde proton would be next to the CH2, so it would be a triplet. Oh, that makes sense! So, the aldehyde (CHO) is attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to something else.
