Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their gamma is much larger than 1. But how does the gamma value relate to how far they travel before decaying?

Wait, the problem mentions that the particles are fast-decaying. So their lifetime is very short in the lab frame. The time it takes for them to reach the detector's inner walls depends on their speed and the detector's size. I think the particles' lifetime is important here because if they decay before reaching the wall, they won't be detected.

So, the particles are created at the center of the detector. The distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The particles have a lifetime, let's call it tau, in their rest frame. But in the lab frame, their lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The lifetime in the lab would be gamma multiplied by tau.

The distance a particle travels before decaying can be found by multiplying its speed by the time it's moving. At ultra-relativistic speeds, the speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance is speed (v ≈ c) times the lifetime in the lab.

Wait, but the speed is v, so the time in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the distance is v * gamma tau. But since v is approximately c, we can write distance ≈ c * gamma tau.

If the particle reaches the detector wall (30 meters away), then c * gamma tau should be greater than or equal to 30 meters. The fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on whether their lifetime in the lab is long enough to cover the distance.

Wait, but the problem says that at gamma of 20, one third reach the walls. So, for gamma=20, 1/3 reach the walls. So, the average lifetime must be such that only a third make it. Maybe it's a statistical thing, like a 50% chance of decaying before a certain time, but not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on the average path length compared to the detector radius. Hmm, I'm a bit hazy here.

Wait, maybe it's about the proper lifetime. So, the particles' proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame sees their lifetime as gamma tau. The time they take to reach the wall is t = distance/speed = 30 m / (v). Since v is roughly c, that's t ≈ 30/(3e8) seconds, which is 1e-7 seconds or so. So if gamma tau is greater than t, then the particle doesn't decay in time and reaches the wall.

Wait, so for a particle to reach the wall, gamma tau must be greater than t. So the condition is gamma tau >= t. Which is gamma tau >= (30 m)/(v). But since v ≈ c, t ≈ 30/(c) meters per second.

Wait, let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau. So the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / v. Since R is 30 m and v is approximately c, so t ≈ 30 / (3e8) meters per second → 1e-7 seconds.

So, if gamma tau is greater than t, the particle has a chance to reach the wall. The probability that the particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall is exp(-t/(tau)). Because the decay follows an exponential distribution. So the probability of surviving (not decaying) until time t is P = exp(-t/(tau)).

Wait, no, the decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/(tau)), but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, the fraction that reach the wall is equal to the probability that their lifetime is longer than t, which is the same as exp(-t/(tau)).

Wait, let me correct. The decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(tau)). So the survival probability, the fraction that reach the wall, is exp(-t/(tau)).

In the given problem, when gamma is 20, the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(-t/(tau)).

Wait, but t is the time to reach the wall, which is 30/(gamma v) ?? Wait, no, the time is t = R / (v), but since in the lab frame, the speed is v, which is beta c. So t = R / (beta c).

But, wait, the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau. So the time t must be less than gamma tau for the particle to survive and reach the wall. So the probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no, because the time in the lab is t, and the lifetime in the lab is gamma tau. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed at time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, that can't be right. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So, the decay rate is lower. So the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, maybe I should formalize it.

In the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau. The time in the lab frame is longer by a factor gamma, so the lab sees the lifetime as gamma tau.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = (distance)/v. Since v ≈ c, t ≈ R/(c).

So the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no, because the decay rate in the lab frame is lower. The decay probability in the lab frame is (1/gamma tau) dt. So the survival probability is exp( - t/(gamma tau) ).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The proper time (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R/(v). Since v ≈ c, t ≈ R/c.

The probability that the particle doesn't decay before time t is P = exp( - t/(gamma tau) ).

So when gamma is 20, the survival probability (fraction reaching the wall) is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( - (R/(c)) / (gamma tau) )

Wait, that's an equation we can use. Let's denote R = 30 m, c = 3e8 m/s.

So,

1/3 = exp( - (30/(3e8)) / (gamma tau) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (30/(3e8)) / (gamma tau )

Which is:

ln(1/3) = - (1e-7) / (gamma tau )

Because 30/(3e8) is 1e-7 s.

Hmm, ln(1/3) is -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So,

-1.0986 = - (1e-7) / (gamma tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = (1e-7) / (gamma tau )

So,

gamma tau = 1e-7 / 1.0986 ≈ 9.1e-8.

Wait, gamma times tau is approximately 9.1e-8 seconds. Let me write that as approximately 9.1e-8 s.

Now, the question is, what gamma do we need to have two-thirds of the particles reach the wall. So the survival probability P is 2/3.

So,

2/3 = exp( - t/(gamma tau) )

Again, t is the same, 30/(c) = 1e-7 s.

So,

ln(2/3) = - (1e-7) / (gamma tau )

ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = - (1e-7) / (gamma tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = (1e-7)/(gamma tau )

We have gamma tau from before, which is 9.1e-8, so let's plug that in.

Wait, let me think. We can set up a ratio.

From the first case, gamma1 tau = 9.1e-8 s.

In the second case, gamma2 tau = ?

In the second case, equation is:

gamma tau = (1e-7) / (ln(3/2)) )

Wait, let me rephrase.

Wait, let me use the first equation for gamma1:

gamma1 tau = (1e-7) / |ln(1/3)| )

Wait, because ln(1/3) is negative, but the absolute value comes from the equation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express gamma tau from the first condition and plug into the second.

So,

From first condition:

gamma1 tau = 1e-7 / |ln(1/3)|.

Because,

ln(1/3) is negative, so |ln(1/3)| is ln(3).

So,

gamma1 tau = (1e-7) / ln(3) ≈ 1e-7 / 1.0986 ≈ 9.1e-8.

Now, for the second condition, we have:

gamma2 tau = (1e-7) / |ln(2/3)|.

Because,

ln(2/3) is negative, so |ln(2/3)| is -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So,

gamma2 tau = (1e-7) / 0.4055 ≈ (1e-7) / 0.4055 ≈ 2.466e-7.

Now, we can divide gamma2 by gamma1 to find the ratio.

gamma2 / gamma1 = (gamma2 tau) / (gamma1 tau) ) = (2.466e-7) / (9.1e-8) ) ≈ 2.466 / 0.91 ≈ ~2.709.

So,

gamma2 ≈ gamma1 * 2.709.

Given gamma1 is 20,

gamma2 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.

So, approximately 54.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 54. So the answer would be A) 54.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, gamma1 tau = 9.1e-8 s.

gamma2 tau = (1e-7)/(0.4055) ≈ 2.466e-7 s.

So,

gamma2 = (gamma2 tau) / tau = (2.466e-7) / (9.1e-8) ) * gamma1.

Because gamma1 tau = 9.1e-8, so (gamma2 tau) = (gamma2) * tau.

Divide gamma2 tau by gamma1 tau:

(gamma2 tau)/(gamma1 tau) ) = gamma2 / gamma1 = (2.466e-7) / (9.1e-8) ≈ 2.709.

So,

gamma2 = gamma1 * 2.709 = 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.

Which is approximately 54, matching option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor ($\gamma$), the survival probability of particles, and the detector's geometry. The particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector with radius $R = 30 \, \text{m}$ and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. The survival probability of a particle reaching the detector's inner walls depends on the exponential decay law:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where $t$ is the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall, $\tau$ is the proper lifetime of the particle, and $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. The time $t$ is given by:

\[
t = \frac{R}{v} \approx \frac{R}{c},
\]

since the particles travel at nearly the speed of light ($v \approx c$). Substituting $R = 30 \, \text{m}$ and $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$, we find:

\[
t \approx \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 1: Relating $\gamma \tau$ to the survival probability
From the problem, when $\gamma = 20$, the survival probability is $P = \frac{1}{3}$. Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

Since $\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3) \approx -1.0986$, we find:

\[
\gamma \tau = \frac{t}{\ln(3)} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{1.0986} \approx 9.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Finding $\gamma$ for $P = \frac{2}{3}$
For the second case, where the survival probability is $P = \frac{2}{3}$, we use the same formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

Since $\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx -0.4055$, we find:

\[
\gamma \tau = \frac{t}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{0.4055} \approx 2.466 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the ratio of $\gamma$
From the first case, $\gamma_1 \tau = 9.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}$, and from the second case, $\gamma_2 \tau = 2.466 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}$. The ratio of $\gamma$ values is:

\[
\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} = \frac{\gamma_2 \tau}{\gamma_1 \tau} = \frac{2.466 \times 10^{-7}}{9.1 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 2.709.
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \times 2.709 = 20 \times 2.709 \approx 54.18.
\]

### Final Answer:
The Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately **54**.
