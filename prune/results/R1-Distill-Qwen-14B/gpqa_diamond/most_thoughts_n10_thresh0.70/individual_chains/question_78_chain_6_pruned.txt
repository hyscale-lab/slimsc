Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the potentials in the context of a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about scalar and vector potentials, right?

So, the problem says that a charge q is moving with trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at time t, where t is larger than tr, the time when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r.

I think the scalar potential V is related to the electric field, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field. Oh right, the potentials are usually used in Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field as E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field as B = ∇×A.

Wait, but for a moving charge, how do these potentials look? I remember that for a stationary charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things change because of the motion affecting the fields.

Oh, right! When the charge moves, the potentials might involve terms related to the velocity of the charge. I think the vector potential A should be proportional to the velocity of the charge. Because when a charge moves, it creates a magnetic field, which is related to A.

So the general form for the potentials from a moving charge is probably something like the static potentials but modified by the motion. I recall that for a point charge moving with velocity v, the potentials can be found using the Liénard potentials. 

In the Liénard expressions, the scalar potential V isn't just 1/r anymore because the charge's motion affects it. There's a term involving the velocity and the distance. I think V is proportional to q/(ε₀ (d c - d·v)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. Wait, d would be the vector from where the charge was (determined by tr) to r, so it's like (r - s(tr)).

Wait, no, the problem says d is the vector from the field generating point (which is s(tr)) to r. So d = r - s(tr). So that's the vector
