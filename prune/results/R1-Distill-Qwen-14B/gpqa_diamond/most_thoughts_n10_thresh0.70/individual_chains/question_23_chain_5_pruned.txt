Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a researcher reacted ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, using TLC, they saw the reactant spot diminish and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which products were formed from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's typically an addition reaction. The mechanism is probably the acid-catalyzed addition where HBr acts as both an acid and the bromide ion attacks the carbocation. Wait, but waitâ€”is this an allylic substitution? No, wait, the compound is an ether with a substituted butenyl group. So the structure is benzene-O-(CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2), but wait, no. Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw that structure.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond starting at position 3. So, 1-yl implies the substituent is on the first carbon. So for but-3-en-1-yl, it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait. Let me number the butenyl group.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, but butenyl has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, which is actually at the end. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-. Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The structure of but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's not possible because butenyl is four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- group. So the substituent is at position
