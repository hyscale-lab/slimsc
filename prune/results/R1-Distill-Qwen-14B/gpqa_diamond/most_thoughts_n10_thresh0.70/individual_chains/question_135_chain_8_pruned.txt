Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, let me parse that. I think the Lagrangian must be something like L = λ ψ† (ῡ + X) ψ. Oh wait, no, the given expression: it's -λ f bar_psi f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) psi_f(y). So probably, the interaction term is something like λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), because the Yukawa term is usually λ ψ ψ X or so. Wait, the Yukawa interaction is typically like λ ψ ψ X, where X is the boson field. So in this case, the interaction term would be λ f ψ_f X ψ_f? Or maybe the Yukawa term is written as λ ψ ψ X. So that would imply that the interaction coupling is between two fermions and the boson X.

I think the general form is that the Yukawa interaction has a term like g ψ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So in this case, the interaction is proportional to f times bar_psi_f times X times psi_f. So the interaction term would be something like -λ f bar_psi_f X psi_f. So that's the term in the Lagrangian.

Now, the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So, I need to determine which fermions X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

In particle physics, a boson can decay into a pair of fermions if the sum of their rest masses is less than the mass of the boson. Because energy and momentum must be conserved, the decay products must have enough energy to be created.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, any fermion pair f fbar that has a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV can be produced.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks have masses around a few MeV, but in the standard model, their masses are much lighter compared to the GeV scale. However, for decay purposes, the quark masses are often negligible unless the boson's mass is very low. Wait, but considering that the qu
