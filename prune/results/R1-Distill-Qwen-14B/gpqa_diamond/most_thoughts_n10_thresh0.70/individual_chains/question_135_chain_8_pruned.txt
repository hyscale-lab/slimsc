Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll think through it.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ̄_f(y)ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that again. Oh right, it's -λ f f(y) times (υ plus X) times ψ bar ψ. So this looks like a Yukawa coupling term. The lambda is the coupling constant, and f probably refers to the fermion flavor or something like that.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I'm supposed to find the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the energy has to be enough to produce the particles, right? So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into because you need energy for each particle (since they have rest mass energy) and also because they have to have some kinetic energy to move apart, but I think for the sake of this problem, it's about whether the mass is sufficient.

Wait, but in pair production, the minimum energy is twice the rest mass of the fermions. So X can decay into a pair of fermions if 2m_fermion ≤ m_X. So m_X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each, because 2*3=6. Wait, no, wait, wait. No, the fermions are produced as a pair, so each has mass m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV. So each fermion must be ≤3 GeV.

Wait, no, wait again. No, because the fermions are a pair, so each has mass m, so the sum is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV. So any fermion with mass ≤ 3 GeV can be a decay product.

But wait, let's think about the fermions available. The known fermions are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), charged leptons (e, mu, tau), and neutrinos. But in
