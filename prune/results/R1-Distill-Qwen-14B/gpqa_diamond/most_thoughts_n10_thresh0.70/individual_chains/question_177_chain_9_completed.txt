Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities—Star_1 is moving at 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. We're told to assume the stars radiate as black bodies and find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity (L) is proportional to radius squared times temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So for two stars, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Okay, since Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's, R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5. Plugging that into the equation, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So that part is 2.25. But we also need to consider the temperature part. So the key is to find T1 and T2.

Now, the stars emit most strongly (peak wavelength) at the same wavelength. Oh, I think that's related to Wien's displacement law. Wien's law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, because if λ_max is same, then T would be same, but wait, wait... no, because if λ_max is same, then T is same. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is same, T must be same. So T1 = T2. Hmm, but wait, the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So same peak wavelength implies same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, what about Doppler shift? Oh right! Because the star's spectral lines are observed, and if the star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength. So for example, if a star is moving towards us, the observed wavelengths are blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted.

So in this case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me think. Since Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s—wait, but which direction? Radial velocity is positive when moving away from us, I think. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that means it's moving away from us, so we're observing a redshift.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the actual (intrinsic) temperature must be related to this. Let me clarify this.

The peak wavelength emitted by the star is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T. But if the star is moving relative to us, this observed wavelength would change. So the observed λ_max, observed by us, is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), but wait, that's for relativistic speeds, but 700 km/s is about a fraction of the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is 0.0023c, so non-relativistic speeds. So perhaps we can approximate the Doppler shift as λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but I'm a little fuzzy here. Let's think: when a star is moving away, the light is redshifted. So the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted.

Wait, but in the problem, the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. So for Star_1, which has v_r=0, λ_obs,1 = λ_emitted,1 (since no Doppler shift). For Star_2, moving at v_r=700 km/s, λ_obs,2 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v_r/c) [since it's moving away (radial velocity positive), so redshift]. Since λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have:

λ_emitted,1 = λ_emitted,2 * (1 + v_r/c)

But according to Wien's law, λ_emitted is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_emitted = b / T. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

Simplify. The b's cancel:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

So T1 is less than T2 because the denominator is greater than 1. So Star_1's temperature is lower than Star_2's.

Wait, but wait, let's get the velocity right. Because radial velocity is positive when moving away from us. So if Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s, then it's moving away, so we have a redshift. So that would make the observed wavelength longer than the emitted. But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, which has v_r=0, the observed wavelength is λ1 = λ_emitted1. For Star_2, observed wavelength λ2 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v_r/c) because it's moving away (so higher wavelength). But the problem says λ1 = λ2. So:

λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * (1 + v_r/c )

But λ_emitted is b/T. So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

Therefore, T1 is T2 divided by (1 + v_r/c )

But wait, v_r for Star_2 is 700 km/s. So let me compute (1 + v_r/c ). Let me compute v_r in terms of c.

c is about 3e5 km/s. So v_r = 700 km/s.

v_r/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333...

So (1 + v_r/c ) ≈ 1.02333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.02333 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So the temperature of Star_1 is about 97.7% of T2.

Wait, so T1 is lower than T2. So now, going back to luminosity.

L1/L2 = (R1² * T1⁴ ) / (R2² * T2⁴ )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5, so (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

T1 = T2 * (0.977). So (T1 / T2) is 0.977.

So (T1 / T2)^4 is (0.977)^4.

Let me compute that.

0.977^2 is approximately 0.9545. Then, 0.9545^2 is about 0.910.

Wait, let me compute 0.977^4:

Compute 0.977 squared:

0.977 * 0.977 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

977 * 977:

= (1000 - 23)^2 = 1000^2 - 2*1000*23 + 23^2 = 1e6 - 46,000 + 529 = 954,529. So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Now, square that again: (0.954529)^2.

Approximating: let's take 0.9545 as 9545/10000.

So (9545/10000)^2 = (9545^2)/(1e8).

Compute 9545^2:

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 9500^2 = (9.5e3)^2 =90.25e6. Then, 9545 is 9500 +45.

So (9500 +45)^2 =9500² + 2*9500*45 +45².

=90,250,000 + 2*9500*45 + 2025.

Compute 9500*45: 9500 *45 = (95 * 100)*45 =95 *4500 = 95*4500.

95*4000=380,000.

95*500=47,500. Total 427,500. So 2*427,500=855,000.

So 90,250,000 + 855,000 =91,105,000.

Add 45²=2025: 91,105,000 +2025= 91,107,025.

So (9545)^2 =91,107,025.

Thus, 0.9545^2 =91,107,025 / 1e8 =0.91107025.

So approximately 0.911.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.977)^4 ≈0.911.

So now, L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.911) ≈ 2.25 * 0.911.

Let me compute that: 2 * 0.911 =1.822, 0.25 *0.911=0.22775. Sum is 1.822 +0.22775=2.04975.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.25 *0.911 is 2.04975. But wait, the options are all around 2.2 or so. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait no! Wait, I messed up the calculation. Because the formula is (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4). So R ratio is 1.5, so squared is 2.25. T ratio is (0.977), to the 4th power is about 0.911. 2.25 *0.911 is approximately 2.049. So L1 is about 2.05 times L2.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: ~2.23, but none of the options are near 2.05. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the Doppler shift calculation. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds is λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is longer (redshifted).

In this problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So for Star_1, which has v_r=0, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

For Star_2, which has v_r=700 km/s, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + 700/c )

Because the observed wavelengths are the same, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 +700/c )

But λ_emit is given by Wien's law as λ_emit = b / T.

So, (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 +700/c )

Cancel b: 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 +700/c )

So T1 = T2 / (1 +700/c )

So let's compute 1 + (700)/(3e5) = 1 + 700/300000 = 1 + 7/(3000) = approximately 1.00233333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

Wait, that's different from what I had before. Oh wait, earlier I thought 700/c is about 0.0023333, so 1 + 0.0023333 is 1.0023333, so reciprocal is approximately 0.99767. So T1 is about 0.99767 times T2.

Wait, that's a much smaller difference in temperature. So (T1 / T2) is 0.99767.

So (T1/T2)^4 is (0.99767)^4.

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me compute (0.99767)^2 first.

0.99767^2 = 0.99534. Then square that: (0.99534)^2.

0.99534 * 0.99534 ≈ 0.99072.

So approximately 0.9907.

So now, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23. So the factor is around 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, so that's the correct answer.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

Thus, the ratio of luminosities is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same. Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, which has no radial velocity (\(v_r = 0\)), the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}
\]

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its motion away from us. The Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T}\)):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Canceling \(b\):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

The speed of light \(c \approx 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
1 + \frac{v_r}{c} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1.002333} \approx T_2 \times 0.99767
\]

The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Temperature to the Fourth Power
The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99767)^4
\]

First, compute \((0.99767)^2\):

\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99534
\]

Then, square the result:

\[
(0.99534)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 4: Luminosity Ratio
Substitute the values into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. The closest option is:
