Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the setup: The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic field is initially along +Z. Then, the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Hamiltonian. The energy is -mu·B, so the Hamiltonian should be proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

Initially, the field is along Z. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma Sz B. But then, the field is turned off and turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma (Sz * 0 + S_y * B + S_z * 0?) Wait no, wait: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So when the field is along Y, mu·B would be gamma (S · B). Since B is along Y, that's gamma S_y B.

Wait, no, more accurately, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z initially, but wait, no, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin vector. Oh wait, no, mu is gamma times the spin vector. Because that's how magnetic moments work for particles like electrons, right? The magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin angular momentum S. So mu = gamma S. So when the field is along Z,
