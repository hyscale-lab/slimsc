Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question involves a series of reactions leading from compound A to E, and I need to figure out what E is.

Let me read the problem again. The reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D loses an inert gas to form E.

And the hints are:

a) A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to give 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, E's IR is ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones. So, E must be a ketone, given the IR peaks which are around the carbonyl region. A's peak is higher than E's. I remember that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) have strong IR peaks around 1700 cm^-1. The exact position can depend on the substituents. For example, conjugation can lower the wavenumber (higher cm^-1 is lower wavenumber? Wait, no, cm^-1 is the unit. So higher number is higher wavenumber. So a ketone's carbonyl is typically around 1700-1750. E's peak is at 1715, which is a bit lower than A's (1750). Hmm, maybe A is an ester or something with a higher carbonyl stretch. But wait, the IR of A is at 1750, which is more like an ester or maybe a ketone? Wait, esters usually have higher carbonyl peaks than ketones. Because the carbonyl in esters is more electron-deficient (due to the adjacent oxygen), so higher frequency. So if A has 1750, that could be an ester. But then E is a ketone at 1715. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Alternatively, maybe A is a ketone and E is a different type of carbonyl. But let's think about the reaction steps.

Let me break down the steps:

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, HCN would add to form a cyanohydrin. But wait, another possibility is that A could be an ester. Wait, but in that case, HCN adding to ester... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if A is a nitrile, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, if A is a ketone, then reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl O is replaced by an -OH and -CN
