Okay, so I have this question about transit probability for two Earth-like planets. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, and their host stars have the same radius but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But same radius.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula I remember is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, more precisely, I think the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's the area blocked. The probability is more about whether the planet's orbit is edge-on enough.

Wait, no, the probability P of a transit is given by P = (R*/a) * (sin i), where i is the inclination. Oh wait, but for a random inclination, the average probability is (R*/a) * (2/Ï€) ) * something. Wait, I might be mixing up some terms.

I think the general formula for the transit probability is (
