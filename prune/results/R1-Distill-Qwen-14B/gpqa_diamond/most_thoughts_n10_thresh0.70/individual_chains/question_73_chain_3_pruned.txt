Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, alright. So first, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics because relativistic effects come into play. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed, and use the relativistic energy formulas for the energy part.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The relative speed here isn't just the difference of their velocities because that's what you'd do in classical mechanics. But since they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, I need to use the relativistic formula. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, am I subtracting them correctly? Because in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so I think v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²). Simplifying that denominator: 1 - (0.3) = 0.7. So numerator is 0.1c. So v_rel = (0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ 0.1428c. Oh, that's about 0.14c when rounded. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a start.

Next, the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is given by the total energy formula E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let me compute gamma for each.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: E_total = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 mc².

Wait, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D has E=5 mc². So I think the correct energy is around 5.96, so option C.

Let me double-check the calculations for errors.

Gamma1: 0.6^2 is 0.36, so 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root is 0.8, so 1/0.8 is 1.25. Correct.

E1: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc². Correct.

Gamma2: 0.5^2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0
