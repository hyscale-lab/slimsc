Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with quantum models, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, would switch the molecule to the next lowest energy state. 

The given data are:
- Mass of atom X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of atom Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (ω) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are four different momenta values. So, the task is to find out which momentum corresponds to the photon needed for the transition.

First, I need to understand the quantum rotation-vibration model. From what I remember, this model treats the molecule's motion as a combination of both rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question mentions the "fundamental state"—I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state (v=0 and J=0 maybe?), and the next state would involve some change in either vibration or rotation.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the next higher energy state, which is the lowest possible. Since the molecule can either change its vibrational state or rotate, but both contribute to the energy. But wait, in the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. However, the non-rigid rotor model (also called the rotation-vibration model) combines both, so the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

So, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think is the ground state for both rotation (J=0) and vibration (v=0). The next state would be the next energy level, which could be either an increase in vibrational state (v=1) or a change in rotational state (J=1). But since the question asks for the lowest possible energy next state, that would be the first excited state, which could be either the vibrational first excited (v=1) or the rotational first excited (J=1), whichever has the lower energy.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot
