Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So the structure is a six-membered cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (O) attached to one of the carbons.

The first reaction is treatment with bromine, forming product 1. Bromine usually adds across double bonds, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, in the presence of a ketone, bromine might do something else. Oh! Maybe it's a ring-opening addition. Or wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone with bromine could undergo a bromohydrination. Wait, no, that's with water. Or maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that requires a diene and a dienophile, and I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe it's an enol formation. So, the ketone can enolize. When enol is formed, the alpha carbons have lone pairs and can react. Bromine (Br2) might add to the enol. Oh, right! That's the bromination of the alpha position. So the product would be a dibrominated cyclohexane, but wait, no, the enol is a conjugate base. So, when bromine adds, each Br adds to adjacent carbons. So, cyclohexanone would form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or maybe it's a vicinal dibromide. Wait, another thought: another possibility is that the bromine adds to the carbonyl group. But cyclohexanone's carbonyl is a ketone, which isn't as reactive as an aldehyde. Wait, no, maybe it's a conjugate addition. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I think I'm confusing this with another reaction. Oh wait, perhaps the bromine is adding to the alpha position via enol formation. So, cyclohexanone can form an enolate, which then reacts with Br2. So, the product would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. But wait, does that make sense? Because cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So adding Br2 might
