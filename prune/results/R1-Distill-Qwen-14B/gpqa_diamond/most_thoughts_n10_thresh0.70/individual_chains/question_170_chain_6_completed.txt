Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve quantum operators and the state vector. 

The given state is (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I think I should write this as a column vector. So it's a two-component vector with the first component 3i and the second 4. So the spin state χ is [3i; 4]. 

The spin operator S_y is given by the Pauli matrix σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

To find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute χ† S_y χ. Let me write down the steps. 

First, compute χ†. The conjugate transpose of χ would be [ -3i, 4 ] since the first component is 3i, and taking the conjugate gives -3i, and the second component is 4, which stays the same. 

So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ] and S_y is (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix. Let me write that out:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So S_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So χ† S_y is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, no. Actually, the operator is (ħ/2) σ_y, so when calculating χ† S_y, we multiply χ† with S_y, which is the same as (ħ/2) times χ† σ_y.

So the expectation value is χ† S_y χ = (ħ/2) χ† σ_y χ.

Let me compute χ† σ_y first. 

σ_y is [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So χ† σ_y is the product of [ -3i, 4 ] with σ_y.

Calculating each element:

First element: (-3i)(0) + 4(i) = 0 + 4i =4i.

Wait, wait. Matrix multiplication: the result is a row vector. Let me do it properly.

Compute the product [a b] * [[c d],[e f]] = [a c + b e, a d + b f]. 

So [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y:

First element: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 +4i=4i.

Second element: (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) = (3i^2) + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

Wait, wait, because [a b] * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] 

So a is -3i, b is 4.

First element: a*σ_y[0][0] + b*σ_y[1][0] = (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 4i.

Second element: a*σ_y[0][1] + b*σ_y[1][1] = (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = (3i^2) = 3*(-1) = -3.

So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by χ, which is [3i; 4].

So [4i, -3] * [3i; 4] = 4i *3i + (-3)*4.

Compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 *4 = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So χ† σ_y χ is -24.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the multiplication. Because it's [4i, -3] multiplied by the column vector [3i; 4]. So the first term is 4i *3i, which is 12 i² = 12*(-1)= -12. Second term is -3 *4= -12. So total is -24.

Now, the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this, so (ħ/2)*(-24) = (-24/2) * ħ = (-12) ħ.

Wait, but wait the options have 12 ħ/25 and similar. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in normalization. Because the state χ must be normalized, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are unit vectors. So let's check the norm of χ.

The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the state isn't normalized. So I should normalize it before computing the expectation value.

Ah! That's a crucial step I might have missed. So the actual state should be χ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4], because the norm is 5.

So I need to include this normalization in the calculation. Let me correct that.

So χ_normalized is (1/5)[3i;4]. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by 1/5.

So χ† σ_y is [ (-3i)(1/5) * σ_y ] ? Wait no, better to redo the calculation with the normalized state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value without normalization and then adjust, but I think it's better to normalize the state first.

So χ becomes [3i/5; 4/5].

Now, χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

So χ† σ_y is [ (-3i/5)*σ_y[0][0] + (4/5)*σ_y[1][0], ... ]

Let me recompute χ† σ_y.

σ_y is:

0   -i
i    0

So χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ]

Multiplying χ† with σ_y:

First element: (-3i/5)*0 + (4/5)*i = 0 + (4i/5) = 4i/5.

Second element: (-3i/5)*(-i) + (4/5)*0 = (3i²/5) + 0 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

So χ† σ_y = [4i/5, -3/5 ].

Now, multiply this by χ, which is [3i/5; 4/5 ].

So [4i/5, -3/5] multiplied by [3i/5;4/5 ].

First term: (4i/5) * (3i/5) = 12 i² /25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (-3/5) * (4/5) = (-12)/25.

Adding both terms: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So χ† σ_y χ is (-24)/25.

Then, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) multiplied by this value.

So (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ )/(50) = (-12 ħ )/(25).

Wait, 24/50 is 12/25, so yes. So the expectation value is (-12 ħ )/(25).

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. So that's the correct answer.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the given spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the state**:  
   The norm of the state is calculated as:  
   \[
   \|\chi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expression for \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is given by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation value formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger S_y \chi_{\text{normalized}}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \sigma_y \)**:  
   The conjugate transpose of \( \chi_{\text{normalized}} \) is:  
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Multiplying \( \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \) with \( \sigma_y \):  
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \sigma_y = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 4i/5 & -3/5 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Multiply with \( \chi_{\text{normalized}} \)**:  
   Now, multiply \( \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \sigma_y \) with \( \chi_{\text{normalized}} \):  
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 4i/5 & -3/5 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i/5 \\ 4/5 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Compute the terms:  
   - First term: \( (4i/5)(3i/5) = 12i^2/25 = -12/25 \),  
   - Second term: \( (-3/5)(4/5) = -12/25 \).  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \left( -12/25 - 12/25 \right) = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final expectation value**:  
   Multiply by \( \hbar/2 \):  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -12\hbar/25 \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
