Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out the structure of the starting material and then determine the final product after each reaction step.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:
- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm. Let's break this down. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton since aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but an aldehyde is usually a triplet? Or maybe it's a conjugated system. Maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Because in that case, the aldehyde proton (H) would couple with the two protons on the double bond, giving a triplet.

Looking at the other signals: the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets. These are likely aromatic protons. The 6.98 is probably para-substituted phenyl groups, as the doublet with 2H suggests ortho coupling but maybe with two substituents. Or wait, maybe it's a doublet because they're adjacent on a ring. Alternatively, maybe two aromatic protons each as a pair.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet for 2H. That could be something like an enol proton, or maybe some kind of conjugated diene. Or perhaps it's an oxygen-bearing proton, like an alcohol or phenol. But the broadness suggests it's exchanging, like an -OH proton. Wait, but phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm. Or maybe it's something else.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H. That looks like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Since it's a doublet, perhaps it's attached to another CH2 group or something else that causes coupling.

Putting it together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and an ether or ester group.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be two rings and a double bond, or one ring, a double bond, and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR, considering the aldehyde (which is a double bond equivalent), the aromatic rings (each ring is one, so two rings would take two), and perhaps another double bond or ring.

Alternatively, maybe one ring, one double bond (like an enone), and a carbonyl.

Wait, the aldehyde is a carbonyl. So the aldehyde takes care of one. Then, say, two aromatic rings (two rings), and a double bond elsewhere (like an enol). That would sum up to four: 1 (aldehyde) + 2 (rings) +1 (double bond) =4.

So maybe the structure is something like an aldehyde with an aromatic group and a conjugated dienol or something.

Let me think about the possible structures. The NMR shows an aldehyde, so the molecule has an aldehyde group (CHO). The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets suggest two aromatic protons each. Maybe two para-substituted benzene rings. Because for a para-substituted benzene, the two protons are equivalent and show up as a doublet each, but wait, para substitution would lead to a singlet because the two protons are equivalent. Oh wait, no, perhaps they are adjacent on the ring. Alternatively, maybe each is part of a substituent.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule could be an ortho-substituted di-substituted benzene. Let me think. If a benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, the protons on the adjacent carbons would each be a doublet, but that's if the substituents are in the para. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The two doublets in the aromatic region could correspond to a para-disubstituted benzene, but each doublet might be from adjacent positions. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two doublets comes from two different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has two aromatic rings, each with a substituent. For example, maybe a diphenyl compound. Let me think of 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the 1H NMR, the aldehyde is a triplet. If it's conjugated with a double bond, that makes sense. So if the structure is something like CH2=CH-CHO, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. Let's consider a structure where there's a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. For example, OCH2CH2... Hmm, but in the NMR, that CH2 is a doublet, so maybe it's connected to another CH2 group. Or perhaps it's an aryl group attached via an oxygen.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. C8: perhaps two benzene rings (each with 6 C) but that would be 12 C, which is way more. Wait no, wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps it's a single ring plus something else. Wait, wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with substituents and another group.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. Maybe the compound is a diphenyl derivative, like a diaryl aldehyde.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 is 1H; that's the aldehyde. The two doublets in the aromatic region could be two sets of two equivalent protons each. So perhaps two substituents on a benzene ring that are each causing those doublets. Or maybe each substituent is a group that contributes two protons as a doublet. Alternatively, the molecule could have two benzene rings, each with a substituent.

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests exchange, possibly an -OH group. But how many -OH groups are present? The molecular formula has one O, but wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So that's one O. Wait, but the NMR shows a peak that could be an -OH, but that would require another O elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the O is part of an ether or ester group. Let me think about the 3.66 ppm as an OCH2 group. So perhaps there's a CH2-O-R group.

Wait, let me try to build the structure step by step.

The aldehyde group is present (from 9.72 ppm). So the formula includes an aldehyde (CHO). The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the rest is C7H8NO.

Wait, the aldehyde is CHO (which is -CHO) so that's one C, one O. So the remaining is C7H8N. Hmm, but wait, the O is already accounted for in the aldehyde. So the molecular formula is C8H9NO: that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, one oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent. Let's think about the substituent.

Another approach: the triplet at 9.72 (1H) is the aldehyde. The adjacent protons (if any) would be the ones causing the triplet. So perhaps the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond, making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. That way, the aldehyde proton would couple with two protons on the adjacent double bond, giving a triplet.

If that's the case, the structure would have a CH2=CH-CHO group, but that's just three carbons. Wait, but the molecular formula is larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CH-CHO- attached to a benzene ring. But that might not add up.

Alternatively, maybe there's a benzene ring attached to the aldehyde group. For example, benzaldehyde derivatives.

Wait, let me think about the coupling. The aldehyde is at the end, and the next group is a double bond. So the aldehyde is at position 1, and there's a double bond between positions 2 and 3. So the structure would be R-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, if it's conjugated, maybe R-CH=CH-CHO. So the aldehyde is at the end, and the double bond is between the two carbons before it.

So the aldehyde proton (CHO) would be adjacent to a CH2 group, but that's not quite right. Wait, if it's CH2=CH-CHO, the aldehyde is on the third carbon. The CH2=CH would have protons on each of the CH2 and CH groups. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible reactions.

The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl → This is typically a nitrous acid condition, used for diazotization of aromatic amines, especially under cold conditions (0-5°C). So perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic amine.

Wait, but the molecular formula includes N, so perhaps the starting material has an aromatic amine group. But wait, the initial NMR data doesn't show any peaks that I would associate with an aromatic amine. Or maybe the amine is in another part of the molecule.

Wait, the NMR shows 9.72 ppm (aldehyde), and 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H). Could the 6.27 be an NH proton? But amines typically show up around 1-5 ppm, depending on the substitution and the environment. A broad peak could be an NH group, but then where's the rest of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a phenol group. Phenol protons are around 5-7 ppm, but the 6.27 is a bit higher. But if it's an enol proton, maybe that's different.

Wait, but the reaction steps involve first treating with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aq KOH and heat.

NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization, which is performed on aromatic amines. The diazonium salt is then typically treated with water (like a hydrolysis step) to give a phenol if the diazonium salt is acidified and heated.

Wait, but what comes after? The third reagent is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a hydrolysis under basic conditions, perhaps for an ester or a nitrile. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step (H2O) is for hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to give a phenol. Then, the third step (KOH, heat) could be some kind of elimination or saponification.

But wait, let's think about the starting material. If the starting material has a nitro group, but that's not indicated in the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a primary amine which gets diazotized, then hydrolyzed to a phenol group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any NH protons. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a secondary amine, but that's less likely to undergo diazotization.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzylamine derivative. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. The aldehyde is at one end. The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. Let's say that's a CH2O group. Maybe connected to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Then, perhaps adjacent to the CH2O group is another CH2, which is part of a conjugated system with the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO? No, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with an attached group.

Wait, another thought: the 3.66 ppm doublet is 2H, so maybe it's a CH2 group connected to an oxygen and another CH2. So OCH2CH2... But where would that lead? Maybe OCH2CH2CHO, but with benzene rings attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzalacetone derivative. Benzalacetone is Ph-CH2-CO-CH2-CHO. But that might not fit the formula.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde derivative. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has two benzene rings attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde and an oxygen.

Let me think about the possible products after the reactions.

The first step is diazotization (NaNO2, HCl). So the starting material must have an aromatic amine group. Then, in aqueous conditions, perhaps the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol group. Then, in the third step, with KOH and heat, perhaps an elimination reaction occurs, like the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the starting material has an amine, after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes a hydroxyl group. So the phenol would form. Then, under basic conditions, perhaps a dehydration occurs, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, if the starting structure has an adjacent alcohol and a carbonyl, then under basic conditions, perhaps an elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the starting compound is 2,4-diphenylbutanamine. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2,4-diphenylbutan-1-ol. No, but the NMR shows an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with an amino group attached. For example, something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde. But the molecular formula would need to fit.

Wait, 4-aminobenzaldehyde would have the formula C7H7NO. But our compound is C8H9NO. So maybe it's something like 3-phenyl-4-aminobenzaldehyde? Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diaryl aldehyde. For example, benzaldehyde with a substituent on the benzene ring. But I'm not quite getting it.

Let me think about the NMR again. The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Could that be an enol proton in a conjugated system? Or perhaps it's a secondary amine, but I don't see an NH in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the 6.27 is an -OCH2CH2CHO group, but that doesn't explain the broadness.

Alternatively, maybe the 6.27 is an NH group. But then, the molecular formula would have N. But in the starting material, we have NO. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the reactions.

1. NaNO2 and HCl: this typically converts primary aromatic amines to diazonium salts. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group (-NH2 attached to a benzene ring).

After that, step 2 is H2O. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis, especially under acidic conditions, to form phenols. So in step 2, the diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).

Then, step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat. This could be a hydrolysis under basic conditions, perhaps of an ester or another functional group. Alternatively, it might be a dehydration reaction, forming a carbonyl or a double bond.

So, considering that, the starting material has an aromatic amine, which becomes a hydroxyl group after the first two steps. Then, the third step could be dehydrating an alcohol to form a carbonyl group.

So, perhaps in the starting material, there's an amino group adjacent to an alcohol group. Then, after hydrolysis, the amino becomes an OH, and then under basic conditions, the adjacent OH and maybe another group undergo dehydration to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting compound has an aldehyde group. So maybe the aldehyde is part of the structure, and the NH2 is somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzylamine derivative with a substituent that includes an aldehyde group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, let's try to piece it together again.

The NMR shows an aldehyde, so the starting material has an aldehyde group. It also has an aromatic substituent, as indicated by the aromatic peaks. The 3.66 ppm is likely an OCH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the structure can't be too complicated. Let's count the atoms.

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CHO would have:

Ph (C6H5), then CH2 (2 C, 2 H), O, CH2 (another 2 C, 2 H), CHO (1 C, 1 O, 1 N? Wait, no, CHO is O, no N. Wait, the formula has N, so perhaps the CH2 group has an amino somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-NH-CH2-CHO. But that would add more H and N. Let's count:

Ph (C6H5), then CH2 (2 H), NH (1 N), CH2 (2 H), CHO.

So the formula would be C8H8N O (since CHO has an O). But the given formula is C8H9NO. So that's one more H than in our structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another substituent.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the possible products after the reactions.

After the first step (NaNO2, HCl), the aromatic amine is converted to a diazonium chloride. Then, in water (step 2), it's hydrolyzed to a phenol. So the product after step 2 would have a hydroxyl group where the amine was.

Then, step 3 is treatment with aqueous KOH and heat. This could cause elimination, perhaps forming a carbonyl group if there's an adjacent alcohol. For example, if there's an -OH and a CH2 group next to it, under basic conditions, they could dehydrate to form a double bond or a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the structure after step 2 has an -OH group adjacent to a CH2 group which is part of a chain leading to the aldehyde.

Let me try to imagine the starting material. Suppose it's 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde. Structure would be Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO. But that's a long chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like Ph-CH2-NH-CHO. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options. The options are:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal
B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal
C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal
D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal

These are all butenals or butanal derivatives with diphenyl groups.

Wait, each option has two phenyl groups attached. Let me see:

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure is Ph-CH2-C(Ph)=CH-CHO? Or maybe the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO?

No, wait but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CH2CHO but with double bond at 3. Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. So the aldehyde is at C4, the double bond between C2 and C3.

So the structure would be Ph groups at positions 2 and 4. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't include the double bond.

Wait, the starting material after the reactions is the product in the options. Let's think about what each reaction does.

Reaction steps:

1. Diazotization: forms a diazonium salt from an aromatic amine.

2. Hydrolysis: converts the diazonium salt to a phenol.

3. Treatment with KOH and heat: perhaps elimination, like forming a carbonyl group.

So, the initial compound has an aromatic amine group. After step 1 and 2, it becomes a phenolic OH. Step 3 may form a double bond or a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a diaminobenzaldehyde. Let's say it's something like Ph-NH-CH2-CHO. Then, during diazotization, the NH2 group is converted to a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis becomes a phenol. Then, in basic conditions, maybe the adjacent CH2 group and the OH could undergo dehydration to form a double bond, leading to an enal.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Looking at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure would be:

CHO-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 ?

Wait, no, but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. So in this case, the aldehyde is at the end. The 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl) would mean a phenyl group attached to the fourth carbon, but but-3-enal is four carbons with a double bond between 3 and 4. So maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond introduced during the reaction.

Wait, let's model the reaction steps.

Let me imagine the starting material is 4-aminophenyl butyraldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CH2-CHO. But this would have the formula C10H13N O, which doesn't match C8H9NO. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a simpler structure. Let me think of 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CHO. The formula is C7H7NO. But our compound is C8H9NO, which has more carbons. So maybe it's a derivative with another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a CH2O group attached. For example, Ph-NH-CH2-O-CH2-CHO. But that would have too many oxygens and carbons.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the options.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure: 

The aldehyde is at the end (CHO). The double bond is between C3 and C4. So the chain is CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CHO? Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CH=CHO. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. But in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So but-3-enal is actually CH3-CH2-CH=CHO? No, I think but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, the options are a bit confusing for me. Let me think about the product after the reactions.

In the first step, the aromatic amine is converted to a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis gives a phenol. Then, treatment with KOH and heat could cause dehydration, forming a double bond or a carbonyl group.

So, if the structure after the first two steps has a hydroxyl group adjacent to a CH2 group, perhaps the third step would eliminate H2O, forming a double bond.

So, the starting material has an NH2 group. After hydrolysis, it becomes an OH. Then, elimination forms a double bond.

So, the initial compound might have an NH2 group attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2 which is part of a chain leading to the aldehyde.

Wait, let me imagine a structure like this: Ph-CH2-NH-CH2-CHO. So, the aromatic amine is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group and then the aldehyde.

After diazotization and hydrolysis (steps 1 and 2), the NH2 becomes an OH. So the structure becomes Ph-CH2-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, step 3 is KOH and heat. Perhaps this would cause the -OH and the adjacent CH2 group to lose H2O and form a double bond.

So, the OH at CH2 and the adjacent CH2-CHO would lose H2O, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups, leading to CH2=CH-CHO. So, the product would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. Wait, but how does that form a double bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-NH-CH2-CHO. After step 2, it becomes Ph-CH2-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, in step 3, the OH and the adjacent CH2-CHO would lose H2O, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, that would give Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. But that doesn't form a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph-CH2-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, the OH could attack the adjacent CH2, leading to elimination of H2O and forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups, resulting in Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. Wait, that's not introducing a double bond. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-NH-CH2-CHO. After step 2, it becomes Ph-CH2-OH-CH2-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, the OH and the adjacent CH2 could undergo elimination to form a double bond, leading to Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. No, I'm not getting the double bond in the right place.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is Ph-CH2-NH-CHO. That would have the formula C8H9NO? Let's count:

Ph (C6H5), CH2 (2 H), NH (1 N), CHO (1 C, 1 O). So the formula would be C7H7NO. But the given formula is C8H9NO, so that's one C and two H more.

Hmm. Maybe there's a CH2 group somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is Ph-CH2-CH2-NH-CHO. So, two CH2 groups between the benzene and the aldehyde. Then, the formula would be C8H11NO. But we have C8H9NO, so two H less. So perhaps that's not right.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to look for the answer based on the reaction steps.

The first two steps convert an aromatic amine to a phenol. The third step could be oxidation or elimination. If it's elimination, then perhaps a double bond forms, leading to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, options A and D have double bonds near the aldehyde. Option B and C have enals or enols.

Option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. Structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO.

Wait, but but-3-enal has four carbons. So numbering from the aldehyde end, but-3-enal would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. But if there's a substituent on the third carbon, as in option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal would be Ph-OH attached to the fourth carbon, but but is four carbons. So the structure would be:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH(Ph-OH)-? Hmm, that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph-OH, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH=Ph-OH. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product after the reactions. The starting material has an aromatic amine, which after hydrolysis becomes a phenol. Then, elimination forms a double bond.

So, the product should have a phenol group and a double bond near the aldehyde.

Looking at option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the structure would have a phenyl group with a hydroxyl at the 4 position, attached to the fourth carbon of the but-3-enal chain.

But but-3-enal is four carbons with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-CH=CHO, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph-OH.

No, that doesn't include a double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is:

Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO.

No, that's but-3-enal, so the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CHO-CH2-CH=CH-Ph-OH.

No, that's longer than but-3-enal.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the NMR of the starting material.

The starting material has an aldehyde (9.72, triplet). The two aromatic doublets (6.98 and 6.51) suggest two different sets of aromatic protons. The 6.27 (broad) might be an -OH or enol proton.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 next to an oxygen.

Putting it all together, perhaps the starting material is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with some substituents. But without the amine, that wouldn't react with NaNO2.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CHO. But the formula for that would be C7H7NO. We need C8H9NO. So perhaps another carbon is present as a CH2 group.

So maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-NH-CHO. Then, the formula would be C8H9NO, which matches.

So, the structure is Ph-CH2-NH-CHO.

Then, the NMR would have:

- Aldehyde proton: triplet (coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH2). So 9.72 (t, 1H).

- The CH2 group next to NH would show up as a triplet or something else. Wait, but in the NMR, the 3.66 is a doublet for 2H. So maybe the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-NH-CH2-CHO. But that would have the formula C9H11NO, which is more than our given formula.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is connected to O.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde with an ethoxy group. But that might complicate the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 4-aminophenyl acetaldehyde. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CHO.

The formula would be C9H11NO, which again doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a benzyl group attached to the NH2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-NH-CHO. So, the formula is C8H9NO.

Yes, that fits.

So, the structure is:

Ph-CH2-NH-CHO.

The NMR would then show:

- Aldehyde proton at ~9.7 ppm, triplet because it's adjacent to the NH-CH2 group. Wait, no, the aldehyde is at the end, so perhaps it's only coupled with the CH2 group.

Wait, the aldehyde proton (CHO) is at the end, so it's adjacent to the CH2-NH group. So the aldehyde proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet.

In the NMR, the 9.72 is a triplet (1H), so that fits.

The CH2 group next to NH would show up as a quartet because they're adjacent to the NH group, but perhaps the NH is exchanging and not showing up. Alternatively, it's split by the NH, but since NH is broad, it's hard to tell.

The aromatic protons: if the benzene ring has substituents, perhaps in the para position. So the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets would correspond to the aromatic protons. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene, the protons are ortho, meta, and para. Para substitution would have two equivalent protons as a doublet? Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has another substituent, like an oxygen. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring is di-substituted, leading to two doublets in the NMR.

But I'm not entirely confident, but let's proceed.

After the first reaction (NaNO2, HCl), the NH2 group is converted to a diazonium salt. Then, in the second step (H2O), it's hydrolyzed to a phenol group. So the structure becomes Ph-CH2-OH-CHO.

Then, in the third step, treatment with KOH and heat. This could cause the -OH and the adjacent CH2 to undergo elimination, losing H2O and forming a double bond between the CH2 and the next carbon (which is attached to the aldehyde).

So, the structure would become Ph-CH2-CHO → Ph-CH2-CHO with a double bond, but wait, how?

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph-CH2-OH-CHO. Then, in step 3, KOH and heat would cause the -OH and the adjacent CH2 to lose H2O, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that would require the structure to be Ph-CH2-CHOH-CH2-CHO or something like that. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 2 is Ph-CH2-OH-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, the OH attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond between C2 and C3, giving Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility: the third step could cause the formation of an enal. So, if there's an alcohol and an aldehyde group, elimination could form a double bond between the two, creating an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

So, the structure after step 2 is Ph-CH2-OH-CHO. Then, under basic conditions, elimination occurs between the OH and the aldehyde's adjacent carbon, forming a double bond.

So, the product would be Ph-CH2-CHO with a double bond between the CH2 and CHO, making it Ph-CH2-CHO → Ph-CH2-CHO with double bond? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 3 is Ph-CH2-CH=CHO.

That would be Ph-CH2-CH=CHO, which is 3-phenylpropenal. But looking at the options, none exactly match this.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the structure would be CH2=CHCH(Ph-OH)CHO.

Wait, but but-3-enal implies four carbons, so:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph-OH. No, that doesn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CHO-CH2-CH=CH-Ph-OH. But that's five carbons. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each reaction step again.

1. Starting material: Ph-CH2-NH-CHO (formula C8H9NO)
2. After NaNO2/HCl: Ph-CH2-NH2 becomes Ph-CH2-N2+Cl-
3. After H2O: Ph-CH2-OH-CHO
4. After KOH, heat: elimination forms a double bond.

So, Ph-CH2-OH-CHO → Ph-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, that would make sense. The OH is on the first CH2, and the CHO is on the next. Elimination would remove H2O, forming a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the structure becomes Ph-CH2-CH=CHO, which is CH2=CHCHO attached to a benzene ring.

But that's propenal (acrolein) attached to a benzene ring. But the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-(phenylamino)but-3-enal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-(4-aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Structure: Ph-NH2-CH2-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but that doesn't fit the formula. Let me count: Ph (C6H5), NH2 (1 N), CH2 (2 C), CH2 (another 2), CHO. So the formula is C6H5-CH2-CH2-CHO with an NH2. So C6 + 4 (from CH2-CH2-CHO) + NH2 (no extra C) → C10H13N O. No, that's way off.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the options and see which one makes sense after the given reactions.

Options:

A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal → structure: Ph-CH2-CH(Ph)-CHO with a double bond between C3 and C4.

B) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal → structure: Ph-OH groups at C2 and C4, with a double bond between C2 and C3.

C) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal → structure: HO-CH2-Ph-CH2-Ph-CHO? Not sure.

D) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal → structure: Ph-OH attached to C4 of but-3-enal.

If the starting material had an amino group that becomes a hydroxyl, and then elimination forms a double bond, option D seems plausible. Let's see.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

Structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH(Ph-OH)CHO? Not quite. Alternatively, it's (Ph-OH)-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, but but-3-enal is four carbons with the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be:

CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph-OH → but that's butanal, not an enal.

Alternatively, the structure is:

CHO-CH2-CH=CH-Ph-OH. But that's but-1-enal, not but-3-enal.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is at the end, and the double bond is between C3 and C4, with a phenyl group attached to C4.

So, structure: CH2-CH2-CH=CHO with a phenyl-OH group on the fourth carbon. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So:

Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO → upon elimination, becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO.

Wait, that would be but-3-enal with the phenyl-OH at C4.

So, the product would be Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO, which is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which is option D.

So, putting it all together:

The starting material is Ph-CH2-NH-CHO.

After reaction 1: diazonium salt.

After reaction 2: phenol, so Ph-CH2-OH-CHO.

After reaction 3: elimination under basic conditions forms a double bond, resulting in Ph-CH2-CH=CHO → but wait, that would be but-3-enal with the phenyl-OH at the end.

Wait, but the structure would be:

Ph-OH-CH2-CH=CHO.

Which is but-3-enal with the phenyl-OH at the fourth carbon. So the product is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which is option D.


The compound has the molecular formula **C₈H₉NO** and the given **¹H-NMR data**. The analysis of the NMR data reveals the following key features:

- **9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)**: This is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (CHO), which is coupled to two protons on an adjacent CH₂ group, forming a triplet.
- **6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)**: These are aromatic protons, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring with substituents.
- **6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)**: This is likely an -OH proton, possibly from a phenol group.
- **3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)**: This corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as oxygen.

The molecular formula **C₈H₉NO** has a degree of unsaturation of 4, which can be accounted for by one aldehyde group, one benzene ring, and one double bond. The structure of the starting material is inferred to be **4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal**.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **NaNO₂ + HCl**: This step involves diazotization, converting the aromatic amine (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt.
2. **H₂O**: The diazonium salt undergoes hydrolysis to form a phenol group (-OH).
3. **Aqueous KOH, Heat**: Under basic conditions, elimination occurs, forming a double bond and resulting in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.

### Final Product:
The final product is **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**, which corresponds to **Option D**. This structure has a phenol group (-OH) at the 4-position of the benzene ring and an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde group.
