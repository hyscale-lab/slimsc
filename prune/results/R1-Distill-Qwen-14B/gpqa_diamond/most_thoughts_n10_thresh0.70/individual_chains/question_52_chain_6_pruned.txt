Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, so the ratio is n1/n2, and when spots are present, this ratio goes down. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, but wait. I think the ratio is n1/n2, and when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is a multiplier from the spotted case to the unspotted case.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think again. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is the ratio when there are no spots (higher) divided by the ratio when there are spots (lower), which would be a number greater than 1.

Now, the transition between these levels is at about 1448 Angstroms, which is in the far UV range. Ti is neutral, so Ti I. The photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so we can use the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels. It states that n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, right? So n1/n2 would be the inverse of that: (n2/n1)^-1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, no. Let me get this right. Let me define the ratio R = n1/n2. Then using the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So R = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, wait. The problem gives the transition wavelength. So λ = 1448 Å. That corresponds to a photon energy. The energy difference between the two levels is given by E = hc/λ. So the transition is when an electron moves from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of that wavelength. So E2 > E1, and the energy difference is (E2 - E1) = hc/λ.

But when using the Boltzmann factor, it's (E2 - E1) that matters. So in the equation, the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T).

Wait, but the transition is absorption or emission? Well, in the Boltzmann equation, the energy difference is positive, so the exponent is positive when E2 > E1.

So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( (hc)/(λ k T) )

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up E1 and E2. Let me make sure. The transition from level 1 to level 2 (excited state) would require a photon of energy hν, which is E2 - E1. So that energy is positive. But when considering the ratio n1/n2, which is R, using the Boltzmann equation, it's:

n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But wait, the question is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So when the star has spots, the overall
