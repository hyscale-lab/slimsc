Okay, so I need to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's read it again carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star whose properties change when it has spots. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes: no spots to spots.

So, the ratio is n1/n2 when no spots, divided by n1/n2 when spots are present. Because the ratio decreases when there are spots, the factor will be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots. So we should compute how much Ti's level ratio changes.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So the factor we're calculating would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots, which would be greater than 1.

In LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the number ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2>E1, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So the temperature of the photosphere when it has spots is 5500 K, whereas without spots it's 6000 K.

Wait, but how does the presence of spots affect the photosphere's temperature? Oh, the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when a star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature (which is an average) goes down. So the star's total emitted flux is lower.

But for the photosphere itself, when spots are present, the photosphere's temperature varies. Wait, but the question says
