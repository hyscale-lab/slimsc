Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. 

The first part is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part involves another compound reacting with reagent B and water to form a carboxylic acid.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, I think. When you react ketones with sodium cyanide (NaCN), I remember there's a substitution reaction that happens. Oh wait, that's the nucleophilic substitution. In ketones, the carbonyl group is a good leaving group under certain conditions. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles.

Wait, but ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution like aldehydes or esters might. Oh, but wait, under specific conditions, maybe with an acid catalyst. Because sometimes, adding an acid can protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. So the CN- could attack the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, maybe the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN, but then what happens with the oxygen?

Wait, maybe it's a substitution where the carbonyl group is converted into an alcohol. Wait, no, because the product has a nitrile group. So perhaps the mechanism is that the ketone reacts with CN- in an acid-catalyzed addition-elimination. 

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a Claisen-type reaction. Oh wait, but that's for esters. Alternatively, the reaction is called the nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. So, when you add a nucleophile like CN- to the carbonyl, you get an addition product. But then what happens? Maybe under acidic conditions, it eliminates water and forms a nitrile group.

Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN in presence of H3O+ (which is option A and B for reagent A). So, butan-
