Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. The question describes a series of reactions starting with compound A (C3H6) and going through several steps to form compounds up to H. The task is to find the incorrect statement among the options given.

First, I'll try to figure out each compound step by step. Let's start with compound A, which is C3H6. The molecular formula C3H6 suggests it's an alkene because the degree of unsaturation is 1. So possible structures are propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But since the first reaction is bromination with CCl4, which is a typical bromination for alkenes via addition, I think A is propene, CH2=CH2CH3. But wait, wait, the formula is C3H6. Propene is C3H6? No, wait. Propene is C3H6? Wait, no. Propene is C3H6? Let me calculate. Each double bond reduces two hydrogens. For propene, it's CH2=CHCH3. Its formula is C3H6, right? So yes. So A is propene.

Reaction 1: Bromination in CCl4. That's a typical addition reaction. So propene would add bromine (Br2) to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Adding Br2 to propene would add across the double bond. So for propene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is that. So B is C3H5Br2.

Reaction 2: Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's an elimination reaction. So when dihalide reacts with alcoholic KOH, it usually undergoes dehydrohalogenation. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. So eliminating HBr twice would form propene again? Wait, but that can't be right because if you eliminate twice, you need two adjacent Br atoms. Let me think. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3?) No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When you add Br2, it should add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCH2BrCH
