Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state, which I think means its lowest energy state. The molecule is made up of two atoms, X and Y, with masses given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

The problem is asking what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. Oh right, so the energy levels in such a system likely involve both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is an extension of the rigid rotor, allowing for bond length changes. But in this case, maybe the question is focusing more on the vibrational part since the photon's absorption would typically cause a change in vibrational state.

Wait, no, the question says it's the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of both rotation and vibration. But the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid rotor). Wait, for a rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but in the non-rigid model, maybe J is allowed to change with vibr
