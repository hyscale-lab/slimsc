Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because relativistic effects come into play.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I think I should calculate their velocities relative to each other, but wait, I remember that relative velocity in relativity isn't as simple as subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different.

The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v relative to a stationary observer is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So here, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. Plugging those in: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute the numerator and denominator separately. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. 

Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as v_rel. So that narrows it down to these two.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. But wait, no, actually, each object's total energy is given by their gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So the total energy E_total is E1 + E2, where E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² and E2 = gamma2 * m2 c².

Calculating gamma for each astronaut. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

For the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c): v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c): v = 0.5c. v²/c² = 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. Gamma2 = 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which is about 5.96 mc². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which doesn't match. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative velocity and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Velocity
The relative velocity formula in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative velocity is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\( 2m, 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\( 3m, 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative velocity is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2 \).

Comparing with the options:
- Option C matches both \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \) and \( E = 5.96mc^2 \).
- Option D has the correct relative velocity but an incorrect total energy.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
