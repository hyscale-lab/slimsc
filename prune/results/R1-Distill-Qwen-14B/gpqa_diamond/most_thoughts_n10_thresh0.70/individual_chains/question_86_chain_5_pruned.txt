Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent. The products in both cases are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The task is to figure out which starting materials (A and B) were used for each reaction.

Hmm, the reactions are:
1. A reacts with LiBH4 and H+ to give the R enantiomer.
2. B reacts with BH3 and H+ to give the S enantiomer.

Wait, but wait a second—LiBH4 and BH3? I thought LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones and aldehydes, and maybe esters. BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, right? Oh, wait, but in some cases, BH3 can be used as a reducing agent, but I'm a bit confused. Oh, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think.

Wait, LiBH4 is definitely a common reducing agent for carbonyl groups. But BH3 isn't usually a reducing agent on its own—like, maybe it's used in the BH3-THF (tetrahydrofuran) complex, which is a strong reducing agent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the same type of reaction but with different agents. Or maybe the conditions influence the stereochemistry?

Wait, the product is a ketone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure is a cyclic ketone. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. So, it's a cyclic ether, and at position 2, there's a ketone group, and position 4 has an ethyl group.

So, how do you form such a compound via reduction? It must be from a carbonyl group. Wait, but wait, if you're reducing a carbonyl, you typically get an alcohol,
