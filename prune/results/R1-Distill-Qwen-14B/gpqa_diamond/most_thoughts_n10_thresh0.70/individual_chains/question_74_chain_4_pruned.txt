Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Let me try to think it through. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. 

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, wait, does that mean that the probability is 32% for the atom to decay within that time? I think so. So, the decay process follows an exponential law, right? Oh, right, the formula for the number of undecayed nuclei is N = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time.

Wait, but wait. The probability that the atom decays within a certain time is related to the decay constant. So, the decay probability P is 1 - e^(-λt). Oh yeah, because P is the probability that it has decayed by time t. So, if after t=100 minutes, the probability is 32% (0.32), then we can find λ.

Let me get that equation set up. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Rearranging that, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So, λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... I think ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, wait, let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that ln(2) is about 0.693. But wait, 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so the ln would be a bit more negative than ln(0.7). Maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.385. So, λ ≈ 0.385 / 100 = 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, but let me get the exact value. Let's compute ln(0.68). Let me think. Using a calculator in my mind, perhaps. Let me compute it step by step. So, 0.68 is e^x, solve for x. e^-0.385 is about 0.68? Let's see: e^0.4 is around 1.4918, so e^-0.4 is about 0.6703. Oh wait, 0.68 is a bit higher than that. So, e^-0.385 is about 0.68? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps using a Taylor expansion or just knowing that ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856. So, λ is 0.3856 / 100 ≈ 0.003856 min^-1.

Now, the question is about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Wait, so the total time from the start is 100 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200? Wait, no, the problem says 100 minutes was the initial time frame with 32% probability. So, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, so now the time from the start is 50 minutes. We need to calculate the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, but wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me read the question again.

Ah, right, the question says, we start monitoring right away, and 50 minutes have passed without decay. So, the current time is 50 minutes. We're to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, which would take us to 200 minutes from the start. But wait, the initial decay probability was given for 100 minutes, so perhaps the time is relative to the initial observation.

Wait no, the way it's phrased is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes, regardless of when you start. Because radioactive decay is memoryless. So, the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, if 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in a 150-minute period from the start.

Wait, no, wait. The probability of decay in a time interval depends on the time elapsed since the start. Oh, but the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same as it always was, regardless of previous time. So, the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-λ t). So, since 50 minutes have passed, and
