Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me see what it's about. 

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. I remember that dehydration of dicarboxylic acids typically forms an anhydride, which is a good leaving group. The anhydride's NMR spectra are given with some specific peaks.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which usually corresponds to an aromatic proton. Wait, but anhydrides don't have aromatic rings, do they? Or wait, maybe it's an alkenyl proton? Oh wait, no, in a cyclic anhydride, maybe there's a conjugated system. Wait, but wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, it would form a cyclic anhydride. So for a cis-alkene, the dehydration would lead to a cyclic structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected via an oxygen bridge. 

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a five-membered ring? Because that's more common. So if the starting acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis double bond, then the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. So the structure would be something like:

O=C-O-C(=O)- (but connected in a ring). Hmm, perhaps it's like succinic anhydride, but with a double bond in the chain. Wait, but the initial compound is a cis-alkene. So perhaps the structure is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, no, wait, the starting acid has a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, wait, that would make a four-car
