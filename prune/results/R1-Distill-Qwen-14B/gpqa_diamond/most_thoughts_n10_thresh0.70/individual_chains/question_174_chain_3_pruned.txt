Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see. The question is about an atomic nucleus undergoing spontaneous fission. Hmm, I remember that fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a lot of energy. But wait, the question says it splits into two fragments, and nothing else. Oh right, sometimes neutrons are released too, but the problem says nothing else, so I guess in this case, no neutrons are emitted. That's a bit unusual, but okay, I'll go with that.

The initial nucleus is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, rest-mass energy is given by E=mcÂ², so that's 300 GeV. So the total energy before fission is just that, since it's at rest.

After fission, it splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2. So m1 is 2 times m2. Wait, no, the problem says the more massive fragment is 2 times more massive. So perhaps m1 = 2 m2? Because if one is twice as massive as the other, yeah, that makes sense.

The sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. The initial mass is M, and the sum m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the original rest mass is M, and the rest masses of
