Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an annihilation process between a proton and an antiproton, producing two particles each of type A+ and A-. The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, wait, annihilation usually involves matter and antimatter particles converting into other particles. So in this case, a proton and antiproton annihilate into four particles: two A+ and two A-. Or wait, no, the reaction is written as p + p-bar → 2A+ + 2A-. So that's four particles in total. But how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So perhaps we can approximate its speed as non-relativistic? Or maybe we treat it as having a very low velocity, so that its gamma factor is approximately 1. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but in particle physics, protons are considered to have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², right? And antiprotons have the same mass. So if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So the total energy in the system is dominated by the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton.

So the initial system has the proton and antiproton. The proton is at rest perhaps? Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low speed. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton is slow. Hmm, the problem statement isn't very clear on that. Wait, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving
