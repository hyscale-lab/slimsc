Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and immune responses. Hmm, let's see. The question says that inner capsid proteins were tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Others got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. But they found the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. Sequencing showed high variability in variable heavy chain genes.

Wait, Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're specialized areas where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated. So when the GFP-tagged proteins reach them, the immune cells there probably take them up.

The high variability in variable heavy chain genesâ€”variable regions are part of the B cell receptor, which is made of heavy and light chains. High variability suggests that these cells are undergoing some process that changes their receptor genes.

The options are about immune processes. Let's think about each option:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process that occurs in B cells after they've been activated. It introduces mutations into the variable regions of the heavy and light chains, increasing the diversity of antibodies. This happens during the germinal center reactions, leading to affinity maturation.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, leading to the destruction of pathogens. But I don't see how this directly relates to the variable heavy chain variability.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but the variable regions don't change here. It's more about the constant region.

D) VDJ recombination: That's the process during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's the initial rearrangement of the heavy chain genes from V, D, J segments. But if the cells are already mature, why would they do this again? Wait, no, VDJ is during early development.

Wait, but the question is about the process happening after the cells have already been activated. The cells were isolated from the Peyer's patches, which are sites of immune response. So in the process of an immune response, B cells undergo several steps. They take up antigens, present them, then in the germinal centers, they undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of their receptors. This process would lead to high variability in the variable regions since each cell's gene is being mutated.

So the correct answer would be A) somatic hypermutation.

Wait another thought: the question says the variable heavy chain gene shows high variability. Somatic hypermutation affects the variable regions, leading to different B cell clones with different specificities. So the process happening is indeed somatic hypermutation. The other options don't directly involve altering the variable regions after the initial VDJ recombination.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid or intestinal mucus, but fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and proliferating cells are isolated from these patches. Sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability, suggesting a process that alters these genes.

Peyer's patches are specialized lymphoid tissues where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes indicates that a process modifying these genes is occurring. Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the germinal center reaction, introducing mutations into the variable regions of the heavy and light chains to increase antibody diversity. This aligns with the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect the variability of the variable heavy chain genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and is not relevant here, as the cells are already activated and present in Peyer's patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in activated B cells during immune responses. This process increases diversity and affinity of antibodies, consistent with the experimental observations.

Answer: A
