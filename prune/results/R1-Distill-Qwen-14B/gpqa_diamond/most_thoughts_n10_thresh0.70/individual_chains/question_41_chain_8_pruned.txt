Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that the glass has an index of refraction n. So in the glass, the speed of light without any movement would normally be c/n, right? Because in vacuum c is 1, so in glass it's 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam? Or towards the observer? Hmm, the wording says the glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Oh wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. That's a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So if the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer, then the glass's motion is towards the observer as well. So maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer.

Wait, no. Suppose the lab is the observer's frame. The glass is moving at velocity v, same direction as the beam. So if the beam is moving towards the observer, then the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Or, perhaps
