Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. So the glass is moving forward, and the light is also moving forward in the same direction.

I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, special relativity comes into play. But wait, this is about light, which always moves at c in a vacuum. But here, the light is in glass, which has an index of refraction n. So the speed of light in the glass should be c/n, right? Because the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index.

Wait, but wait, the glass itself is moving. So I need to consider the velocity of the light relative to the lab, which includes the motion of the glass. Hmm.

Let me visualize this. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the front, because the glass is moving towards the observer. But wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. No, wait: the glass is moving toward the observer. So if the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them, the front of the glass would be moving towards the observer, and the light inside is moving along with it.

Wait, so from the lab's point of view, the glass is moving at velocity
