Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, stability constants... those are the ones that tell us how stable a complex is, right? The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly how to apply them.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The options are A to D, which are all percentages. Let me read the problem again.

So, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. Total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and SCN^- is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1, β2, β3, β4 are 9, 40, 63, 16 respectively. Wait, I'm not sure about the order of the complexes. I think each β corresponds to a different complex. Like, Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, etc., maybe?

I remember that the stability constant (β) relates to the formation of a complex. For a complex like Co(SCN)n^2- or something, β is the formation constant. So, each β here represents a different complex. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or wait, maybe I should think about the charges. Co^2+ and SCN^-.

Wait, Co(II) is +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge), the charge would be +2 - n*(+1) from SCN? No wait, adding SCN as ligands would contribute. Each SCN^- is -1, so for each SCN attached, the charge of the complex would be Co's charge minus the sum of SCN charges. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2 - n). Hmm.

Wait, no. Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So when you form a complex, the overall charge depends on how many SCN are attached. For example, Co(SCN)_1 would be Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (since 2+ -1 = +1
