Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem, and I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] total is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the stability constant (β) indicates how stable a complex is. Higher β means the complex is more favored. The complexes in question are probably Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is the number of SCN- ions attached.

Wait, the question mentions blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions. So I think it's referring to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. Wait, but what's the structure of the complexes here? The order of stability is given by β1 to β4. Let me think: β1 is for the first complex, which might be Co(SCN)^(+) (since Co is +2, each SCN is -1. So one SCN would make it Co(SCN)^(+1), but wait, Co^2+ plus one SCN^- is CoSCN^+? So the charge would be +1. But I'm a bit confused. Wait, Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for the first complex, n=1: Co(SCN)^(+1) → Co^2+ + SCN^- → complex charge is 2+ -1 = +1? So [Co(SCN)]^+ would have a charge of +1. Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would have no charge (2*(-1) + 2=0). Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about the specifics, but perhaps for the purpose of solving the problem, the exact charge isn't needed. Maybe the key is the stability constants.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the complexes are in order of increasing n? I think βn is the stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is the constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, but what's the general form of the stability constant expressions? The stability constant (β) for a complex ion is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) from Co^2+ and SCN^- would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n)

And the stability constant βn is:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So higher βn means the complex is more stable and more likely to form.

In this problem, the four given β values are for n=1 to n=4. Wait, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That might mean that the most stable complex is n=3.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ions, so n=2. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So β2 is 40.

But wait, the problem says 'the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes'. I'm trying to remember; I think that the different complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is blue, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue as well? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^− is another color. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but perhaps the exact colors aren't needed for the calculation. The problem is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two SCN- ions.

So the task is to find the fraction of all Co species that are in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^0, considering the given concentrations and the stability constants.

To approach this, I think I need to calculate the distribution of Co among the different complexes. The total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and SCN^- is 0.1 M.

The species present are:

1. Free Co^2+ : [Co^2+]
2. [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2)
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^− (n=3)
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{2−} (n=4)

But wait, the stability
