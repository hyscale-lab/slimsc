Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a specific matrix operator, Ay. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies.

So, the operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is Planck’s constant. The matrix S has the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, I think S is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. The σy matrix is exactly like S here. Because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli y-matrix, σy.

So Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy. The eigenvalues of σy are ±i, right? Because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1 multiplied by the respective matrix. So σy has eigenvalues +i and -i. Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. But wait, for σy, when you find its eigenvalues, I think the eigenvalues are ±i. Or maybe not. Hold on, let's think again.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. Oh wait, no! Wait a second. Because σy is Hermitian? No, wait. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, yes. Let me confirm. The Hermitian condition is that the matrix equals its conjugate transpose. Let me check σy:

σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. That's the same as the original matrix because the elements are 0, -i becomes i*, which is i, and i becomes -i*, which is -i. Wait, wait no, the conjugate transpose of [0, -i; i, 0] is [0, i; -i, 0], which is the negative of the original. So σy is not Hermitian? That can't be right because I remember that Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Oh, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, actually, σy is Hermitian? Let me compute. The conjugate transpose of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S. So yes, σy is Hermitian because S dagger equals S. Because the (1,2) element is -i, so its conjugate is i, and the (2,1) is i, which becomes -i upon conjugation. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me do it properly.

The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements and take their complex conjugates. So the (1,2) element is -i, so its conjugate is i. Then, the (2,1) element is i, whose conjugate is -i. So the conjugate transpose would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Comparing this to S: S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to S only if i = -i, which isn't true. So S is not equal to its conjugate transpose, meaning it's not Hermitian. Hmm, that's conflicting with what I thought about Pauli matrices.

Wait a second, maybe I got the Pauli matrices wrong. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Their forms are:

σx: [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy: [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz: [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So σy is indeed [[0,-i],[i,0]].
