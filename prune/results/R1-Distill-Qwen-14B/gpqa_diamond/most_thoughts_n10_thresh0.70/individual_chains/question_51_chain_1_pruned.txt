Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, the method of images might come into play, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, potential energy in such systems usually involves considering how the charges are arranged. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will adjust themselves to keep the sphere's potential at zero. Oh right, because being grounded means it's connected to the Earth, which is at zero potential.

So, the conducting sphere is neutral to start with? Well, when you bring a charge q near it, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. Conductors have charges on the surface, so the induced charges will be on the outer surface. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges would actually cause a flow of electrons to or from the Earth. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, when you bring a charge near a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange, but if it's grounded, it can lose or gain charges to stay at zero potential.

Wait, if the charge q is positive, the conducting sphere will have negative charges induced on the near side and positive on the far side. But because it's grounded, the excess positive charges would leave the sphere, going into the ground. So the sphere would end up with an induced charge of -q' where q' is the magnitude of the induced charge.
