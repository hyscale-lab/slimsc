Okay, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me think through each star step by step.

First, I'll look up the info about the spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, which means apparent V mag less than 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its V mag is lower than 17. So for both spectrographs, the star's apparent V must be <=16 because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So a star must have apparent V mag <=16 to be detected by both.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So apparent V mag ≤17 can be observed? Or do I have that backwards? Because 'brighter than' in magnitude terms is lower numbers. So if a star has V mag brighter than 17, that's V mag less than 17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So apparent V mag less than 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, but wait. The question says for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star's apparent V is 16, that's brighter than 17? No, wait, the magnitude scale is inverted. A magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's magnitude is less than 17.

So, the limit for ESPRESSO is apparent V <=17 (so including 16, 15, etc. down to brighter). HIRES can only see up to 16. So to be visible by both, the apparent V must be ≤16.

So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be seen by both. Now let's
