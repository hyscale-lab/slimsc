Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both. Let me start by understanding the question.

The key points I remember are that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, wait, noâ€”apparent magnitude is tricky. Wait, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star has an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Because lower numbers are brighter. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So that's V <16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and less than 16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, no. Wait, the question says, with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, that's confusing. Because in astronomy, higher magnitude means fainter. So if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that would mean stars with V <17. Because, for example, a 1st magnitude star is brighter than a 17th. So for both, the stars must have apparent V magnitudes less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). Wait, but no, wait: the statement is that each can observe stars brighter than those magnitudes. So to be observable by both, the star's apparent V must be brighter than 17 (so V <17 for ESPRESSO) and brighter than 16 (so V <16 for HIRES). Wait, that can't be right because if a star is brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17. So any star visible to HIRES
