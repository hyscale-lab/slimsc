Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. 

They give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constants can be a bit tricky. Formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-, Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Stochiometric probably means that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are in the exact ratio needed to form the complex. So, initially, when you have the complex, the amounts of free Ca²+ and EDTA are very low because they form the complex completely.

Wait, but at equilibrium, some of the complex might dissociate a little. Because Kf is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very small.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the complex as CaY²-, where
