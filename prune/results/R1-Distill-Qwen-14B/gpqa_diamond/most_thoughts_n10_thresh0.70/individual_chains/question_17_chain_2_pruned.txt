Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my EDTA complexation stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex is usually something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The K value given is pretty large, 5e10, which means the reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex. So, under ideal conditions, almost all the Ca²+ and EDTA should form the complex.

Wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

But wait, since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So, the free Ca²+ concentration should be very low. That would make sense because the K is 5e10, which is a big number, so the complex is stable.

So, the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaY²− ; K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

But since we have a solution where the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA and Ca are present in stoichiometric amounts, we can model this. Let me think about the initial setup.

Wait, the complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The dissociation would be:

CaY²
