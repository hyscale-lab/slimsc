Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the question is asking. RHIC collides heavy ions, and we're given a nucleus X which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the nucleus in question is Li-6 because Li has 3 protons (since it's element 3) and 3 neutrons, making it 6 nucleons total. So X is the Li-6 nucleus.

The problem asks for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember that in special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by the equation E = γ * m₀c², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m₀ is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I should calculate γ first.

Given v = 0.96c, let's plug that into the Lorentz factor formula. So v squared is (0.96c)^2, which is 0.9216 c². Then v²/c² is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So γ is 1 divided by 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1, right? Because 0.28 * 3 = 0.84, and 0.28 * 0.5714 is about 0.16, adding up to 1. Oh, but wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 isn't exactly 1. Let me compute 1 / 0.28. So 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is approximately 3.571428... So yeah, that's correct.

So γ is approximately 3.5714. Now, the total energy E is γ times m₀c². But what's m₀, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus? I think the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), since it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each about 1 u. Wait, but the exact mass of a proton and neutron is a bit over 1 u each, but perhaps I should look it up or use a more precise value.

Wait, I don't have exact values here. Let me think. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so m₀ = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) u? Wait, no. Wait, each proton is 1.007276 u, each neutron is 1.008665 u. So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, m₀ = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) * u? Or wait, no. Each nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, so the total mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but wait, that's not exactly right. Because the binding energy of the nucleus makes it a bit less than the sum of individual nucleons. Wait, but for a nucleus, the actual mass is a little less because of the mass defect due to binding energy. But I think in this problem, we can safely approximate the rest mass as approximately 6 u, but perhaps a bit more precise.

Wait, but maybe the question expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as approximately 6 u. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that one atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So I can compute m₀c² as m₀ * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, but let's get back to the problem. Let me calculate the rest mass energy of the nucleus. If m₀ is approximately 6 u, then m₀c² is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. But if I calculated more precisely, perhaps m₀ is 6.047823 u, then 6.047823 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that: 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.047823 * 931.5 is approximately 0.047823 * 900 = 43.0407 and 0.047823 *31.5= about 1.508 MeV. So total is 43.0407 + 1.508 = ~44.5487 MeV. So m₀c² is approximately 5589 + 44.5487 = 5633.5487 MeV, which is about 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem expects that level of precision. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the rest mass as 6 u times 931 MeV/c², so 6*931=5586 MeV, which is 5.586 GeV.

But to proceed, perhaps I should use the rest mass of Li-6 as 6 u, so m₀c² = 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV = 5.589 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the actual binding energy for Li-6 is about 5.589 MeV, so the rest mass is a little less than 6 u. Let me check: the binding energy of Li-6 is about 5.589 MeV. So the mass is (6 * 931 MeV) - (5.589 MeV) = 5586 - 5.589 = 5580.411 MeV, which is 5.5804 GeV. Hmm, but wait, actually, the mass of the nucleus is (sum of protons and neutrons) minus (binding energy / c²). So perhaps m₀c² is (sum of individual masses) - binding energy.

So let me compute it accurately. Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c². Neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

Wait, no, wait. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, which is 1.007276 * 931.5 ≈ 938.72 MeV/c². Similarly, a neutron is 1.008665 u, so 1.008665 * 931.5 ≈ 940.01 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the sum is 3*(938.72 +940.01) = 3*(1878.73) = 5636.19 MeV.

The binding energy of Li-6 is about 5.589 MeV (as per some sources), so the rest mass energy is 5636.19 - 5.589 ≈ 5630.6 MeV, which is 5.6306 GeV.

Wait, but others might say that the binding energy is about 5.589 MeV, but in any case, perhaps the problem expects me to use a simpler approach, such as treating the nucleus as having a mass of 6 u, so around 5.589 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps
