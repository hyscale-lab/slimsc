Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four possible chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to determine which one is correct based on the spectroscopic data provided.

First, let's go through each piece of data one by one. 

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The question mentions a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So, that suggests there might be an alcohol or possibly a carboxylic acid group. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak around 2500-3300 cm-1. Also, the question says it's a very broad peak at 3000, which could fit with either an alcohol or maybe a phenolic O-H. But given the other peaks, let's see.

The FTIR also shows strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, the 1700 region is usually indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The peak at 1650 could be due to conjugated carbonyl groups, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl system. I'm thinking maybe an ester or a ketone here. Because if there's an ester, you typically see two carbonyl peaks, but wait, no, esters have one carbonyl peak usually. Wait, maybe one is from an ester and the other from something else. Or perhaps one is a conjugated carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring in conjugation. Alternatively, the 1650 might be from an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching), but then the 1700 would still be the carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, the 1700 could be from an ester or ketone, and the 1650 perhaps from a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe the compound has a conjugated system.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. The question says there are several peaks, including ones corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So that tells me the compound has an alkene group. So it's probably an unsaturated molecule. 

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be CH3COCH3 (acetone) but that's 58. Wait, no, wait. 45 is the mass of C3H7O or something else. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular ion of an isobutyl group (C4H9) but that would be 57. Wait, perhaps it's from a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CO group. Wait, 45 corresponds to a fragment like CH2CH2O? No, perhaps the fragment is something like (CH2)2O or another structure. Wait, wait, maybe it's the loss of a certain group. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2CO+, which is 57? No, wait, 45 is 45. Let me calculate: 12*3 +1*9 +16*1? No, 3 carbons would be 36, plus 9 H is 9, so 45. So that would be (CH2)2CHO or something else? Hmm, perhaps it's a smaller fragment.

Wait, perhaps the m/z 45 is the molecular ion of a smaller molecule, like CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) which is C2H4O. Molecular weight is 44 (12*2 +4 +16= 24+4=28; wait, 12*2 is 24, 4 H is 4, O is 16. So total 24 +4 +16=44. Oh wait, so 44 is the molecular weight of acetaldehyde. So if there's a fragment at 45, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else.

Alternatively, think about the possible molecular formulas. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Each of these has a different molecular formula. Let's compute their molecular weights:

C6H12O2: 6*12=72 +12*(1)=12 + 2*16=32. Total 72+12+32=116.

C6H10O: 72 +10*(1)=10 +16=16. Total 72+10+16=98.

C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. If the molecular ion is heavier, perhaps that fragment comes from losing a larger group.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's try to figure out the possible structure.

We know from the IR that there's a broad O-H peak, so the molecule has an O-H group. That would mean the formula must include at least one O in that group. So options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Wait, all have O except—no, all have O. Because the options are O-containing. So the O is in the structure, probably as an alcohol, ester, ketone, etc.

The IR peaks: 1700 and 1650. Let's think about possible functional groups. 1700 is likely a carbonyl, say ester or ketone. 1650 could be another carbonyl but conjugated, but maybe it's something else. 

The fact that the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens indicates a double bond. So the molecule has an alkene. So perhaps it's an ester with a double bond. Maybe something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR or similar.

So, considering that, the formula would include an ester group (O in the carbonyl and O in the ester oxygen) plus an alcohol group? Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, but the O-H is broad, which suggests an -OH group. So perhaps it's an alcohol with another carbonyl group.

Wait, could it be a hemiacetal or something else? Hmm, probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but the O-H would be very broad, but the IR would have a peak around 1700 for the carboxylic acid carbonyl. But the question says the O-H is a very broad peak at 3000, which would fit a carboxylic acid. But then the other peak at 1650 would be the C=O of the acid. Wait, wait, but in that case, why 1700 and 1650? Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. 

Alternatively, another possibility: the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. But if the molecule has a benzene ring, that would absorb around 1600, but 1650 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone (conjugated ketone and alkene).

Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests an alkene is present. So perhaps the structure is something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Let's think about the molecular formulas.

The options:
A) C6H12O2: degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Since X and N are 0 here.

So: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 - 12)/2 = 2/2 =1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a double bond or a ring.

But wait, wait. The formula is C6H12O2. The double bond could be an alkene plus maybe an ester group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone, which would likely have a carbonyl and an O.

But let's compute the degree of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2:

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond.

But wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought there was an alkene and possibly an ester (which has a carbonyl). So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should compute it correctly. The formula is CnHmOp. The DoU is (2n +2 - m - p)/2.

So for A: C6H12O2. n=6, m=12, p=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2= 0/2=0. So no rings or double bonds? That can't be right because the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So that's a contradiction. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, the formula is C6H12O2. Let's compute:

DoU = (2n +2 - m - p)/2.

n=6, m=12, p=2.

So (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2=0. So no rings or double bonds. But the NMR shows vinyl (alkene) protons, which imply a double bond. So this can't be option A because that would have zero DoU, which doesn't fit the presence of an alkene. Therefore, option A is unlikely.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -1)/2 = (14 -11)/2 = 3/2=1.5. But DoU must be an integer, so perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, wait:

Wait, wait. Wait the formula is C6H10O. So n=6, m=10, p=1.

DoU = (2*6 + 2 -10 -1)/2 = (14 -11)/2=3/2=1.5. Hmm, which isn't possible. So that suggests that this formula is not possible, but wait, perhaps the compound is more complex. Wait, perhaps it's a problem with the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's recalculate: 2n +2 = 2*6 +2=14. Subtract H and X (assuming X=0) and P (O). So m=10, p=1.

14 -10 -1=3. So 3/2=1.5. Hmm, which is not possible, so this suggests that option B is invalid. But that can't be right because the options are given. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or N, it's (2C +2 -H -O)/2? Or is it (2C +2 - H - X + N - P)/2, where P is the number of phosphorus atoms? No, perhaps a better approach is to compute it as (2n +2 - m - x)/2, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the molecular formula using the general formula.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the molecular weight for each option and see which one aligns with the mass spectrum's m/z=45.

Wait, another angle: the presence of two oxygen atoms. Let's see, looking at the options, options A and C have two O atoms, B and D have one O.

The IR shows a broad O-H, so perhaps it's an alcohol (-OH) which would require at least one O. Then, the 1700 cm-1 suggests another O-containing group. So maybe an ester (which has two O atoms) or a ketone (which has one O). If it's an ester, then the compound would have two O's, so the formula would have O2. That would point to options A or C.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=0, which can't be right because the NMR shows vinyl Hs, implying a double bond, which requires a DoU of 1. So that's a problem.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU calculation:

n=6, m=10, p=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -2)/2 = (14 -12)/2=2/2=1.

So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a double bond. That fits with the vinyl Hs. So that's a possibility. So perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond.

So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester, but that would also have a ring, which would require a higher DoU. Wait, a cyclic ester would have a ring (one DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU?), no. Wait, cyclic esters (lactones) have a ring and a carbonyl group, so that would be two DoU. But option C's DoU is 1, so that's not possible. So perhaps it's a simple ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have a double bond (one DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), but that would require two degrees of unsaturation, which would make the DoU 2.

Wait, wait, option C's DoU is 1, so that can't be. So maybe I'm getting tangled up here. Let me think again.

Wait, if the structure is an ester (so two O's) and an alkene (one DoU), that would make the DoU 2 (since each double bond or ring counts as one). So the formula would need to have two degrees of unsaturation.

Let's check option C: C6H10O2. The DoU is (2*6 +2 -10 -2)/2 = (14 -12)/2=1. So that's only one DoU, which would be either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, which implies a double bond, so that would account for the one DoU. So the structure could be an ester with a double bond, but not a ring.

Hmm, maybe that's possible. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CH-O-CO-something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe an ester group and an alkene, but not conjugated.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps the 1700 is from the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 is from an alkene. Wait, but alkenes typically absorb around 1650 cm-1. So that could fit.

But if the structure is a simple ester with an alkene, then the molecule would have two separate double bonds? No, because the DoU is 1. So maybe the ester group is conjugated with the alkene. So that the ester carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, which would lower the carbonyl stretching frequency to about 1700, perhaps, and the alkene would be at 1650. Hmm.

Wait, but if the ester is conjugated to the double bond, that would account for two DoU (the ester carbonyl and the double bond), but that would require a DoU of 2. But option C has DoU 1. So that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go back to the options.

Another approach: the molecular formula and the mass spectrum's m/z=45.

Looking at the possible molecular formulas:

Option C is C6H10O2.

Suppose the molecular ion is around 114 (6*12=72, 10 H=10, 2 O=32; 72+10+32=114). So the molecular weight is 114.

In the mass spec, the fragment at m/z=45 is observed. How does that fit?

45 could be a fragment like CH2CH2O or CH3CO (which is 43, but maybe with an additional H somewhere). Alternatively, maybe it's a loss of something from the molecule.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion of a fragment, like C3H7O. Wait, C3H7O would have a molecular weight of 3*12 +7 +16 =36 +7 +16=60? No, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps it's a different fragment.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. If the compound is an ester with a double bond, then perhaps the mass spectrum could lose the ester group and leave a smaller fragment.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is methyl vinyl something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be a loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's C6H10O2, which is option C. The molecular weight is 114, as calculated earlier. So, what would the mass spectrum show? If the molecule breaks in a certain way, perhaps losing a part of it.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If it's a di-ester, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 45 comes from a (CH2)2O group. (CH2)2O has 2 carbons, 4 H, and 1 O. So molecular weight is 2*12 +4 +16=24+4+16=44. Close to 45. But maybe there's a CH2CH2O+ ion, but that's 44, not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different fragment. Maybe a CH2=CH-O group. That would be C2H3O, which is 2*12 +3 +16=24+3+16=43. Not 45.

Wait, maybe the methyl ester part, like (CH3O)CO-... Hmm, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and when it breaks, the ester group splits off, leaving a CH2CH2 fragment with some oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps the base peak is from a fragment with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another idea: the m/z=45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is acetone. Acetone's molecular weight is 58, but wait, (CH3)2CO is 58? Wait, CH3COCH3 is 58. So how does that relate?

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O+ group, which is C2H4O, molecular weight 44. Hmm, but it's 44, not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a larger fragment. Let's think about the molecular formula C6H10O2. If the molecule is something like CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2CH2, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond, but that seems unlikely given the molecular formula.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like methyl vinyl ketone, but then that would have a different formula. Wait, methyl vinyl ketone is C4H6O. But our options are larger, so perhaps it's a larger molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C6H10O2, which has a double bond and an ester. Let's think of a specific example. Maybe it's an ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But that's C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. Then, when it breaks, perhaps it loses the ester group and the acetate part, leaving a fragment like the vinyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of the ester group. So the remaining part would be the vinyl group attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps when the ester breaks, you get a fragment like CH2=CHCO+ which would have a molecular weight of 58. But that's not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, but that's more common in ketones.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the molecular formula that fits all the other data.

Let me revisit the IR data. Broad O-H at 3000 cm-1 suggests an -OH group. The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1: 1700 is likely a carbonyl (either ester, ketone, or acid), 1650 might be an alkene or another carbonyl. But if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740 cm-1. Wait, wait: ester carbonyls are usually around 1730-1750 cm-1. So if the peak is at 1700, maybe it's a conjugated ester or perhaps a ketone. 

Wait, if 1700 is a ketone, then the 1650 might be an alkene. So the structure has a ketone and an alkene. Plus an -OH group. So perhaps it's something like cyclohexanone with an alcohol and a double bond, but that might complicate the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto alcohol. For example, something like CH2=C(OH)COOR. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H's, so the double bond is present. The IR suggests a ketone or ester. The O-H is present, so maybe it's a beta-hydroxy ketone or ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with an -OH group. Let me think. So, for example, (Z)- or (E)-3-pentenoic acid methyl ester. But that would have a different formula.

Wait, the IR peaks are 1700 and 1650. If there's a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps the ester is conjugated to the double bond, which would lower the carbonyl peak to around 1700 cm-1. That's possible.

So putting it together: the compound has an ester group (so O2), an alkene (so DoU 1), and an -OH group. Wait, but if it's an ester, that's O2; an -OH would require another O, making it O3. But none of the options have O3. So that's a problem.

Wait, another possibility: the -OH is part of the ester. No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the -OH is from an alcohol group, and the carbonyl is from a ketone. So, the structure would have an alcohol group, a ketone, and an alkene.

If that's the case, the formula would have O2. So looking at the options, option A and C have O2.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=0, which can't be because of the alkene.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=1, which could fit an alkene.

So, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted ketone with an alcohol group. But how does that fit the IR?

Wait, the O-H is broad, so it's an -OH group. The ketone (1700) and the alkene (1650). So that would make sense.

So, the structure could be something like CH2=CH-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that would have a ketone, but where would the O2 come from? Because the formula is C6H10O2. So, perhaps it's a diol? No, because the IR only shows a broad O-H, which would be more consistent with a single -OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Another angle: the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. What's the formula that would give that? 45 is 45. So, possible combinations: C3H7O (3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59, no), C3H3O2 (3*12 +3 +32=36+3+32=71, no). Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be C3H7O+ but that's 59, no. Alternatively, maybe it's C2H3O+, which is 43, but not 45. Or perhaps C2H5O+, which is 45? Let me check: C2H5O is 24 +5 +16=45. Oh! Yes! So C2H5O is 45.

So, the fragment could be CH2CH2O+, but that's C2H4O. Wait, no, because C2H5O has 2 carbons, 5 H, and one O. So the formula is C2H5O, which has a molecular weight of 45.

So, what structures have a C2H5O fragment? Perhaps a vinyl ether, or some sort of ester or alcohol.

If the parent compound is something like CH2=CH-O-R, then the fragment could be CH2=CH-O+ (which would be 45 if R is lost). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, the ester could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an ethyl group. Then, the molecule would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), which is C5H8O2. But that's a five-carbon compound. Our options are six carbons, so perhaps it's a similar structure with six carbons.

Wait, let's think of a six-carbon compound. Maybe the ester is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. So the formula would fit option C. Now, when this molecule breaks, perhaps it loses the ester group (COOCH2CH3) and the remaining part is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But that's C4H8, molecular weight 56. Alternatively, maybe a different cleavage.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a cleavage that produces a CH2=CH-O- group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is generated when the ester group breaks off, leaving a carbonyl. Hmm, but that's getting a bit unclear.

Alternatively, the mass spec peak at 45 could be the result of a McLafferty rearrangement, but I'm not certain.

Putting all this together, perhaps the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.

So, the steps are:

1. FTIR: broad O-H (3000 cm-1), so an -OH group. Also, strong peaks at 1700 (carbonyl, possibly ester or ketone) and 1650 (possibly alkene or conjugated carbonyl).

2. 1H NMR: vinyl Hs, so an alkene present.

3. Mass spec: fragment at m/z=45, possibly C2H5O.

So, the formula must have at least two oxygen atoms (since we have a carbonyl and an -OH, but no, the -OH is one O; the carbonyl is another. So O2.)

Looking at options, options A and C have O2.

Option A: C6H12O2, DoU=0. Can't have alkene → not possible.

Option C: C6H10O2, DoU=1. Possible with an alkene and an ester group.

So the structure could be an ester with an alkene and an -OH group. Wait, but that would require O3. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of the ester. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester and a ketone, but that would require more O's.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol and there's an ester group. So, two O's in the ester (O in carbonyl and O in ester group) plus the O in the alcohol. That would make three O's, but the options don't have O3. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol, and the carbonyl is from a ketone, and there's an alkene. So O comes from the alcohol and the ketone. So total O's would be 2.

So, the formula would be C6H10O2 (if it's a ketone, an alkene, and an -OH). That's option C.

So, the IR peaks fit: O-H (broad), ketone (1700), and the alkene (1650). The NMR shows vinyl H's. The mass spec has a fragment at 45, which could be a C2H5O group.

So the correct option is C) C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data to determine its chemical formula. The options are C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O. The following analysis leads to the identification of the correct formula:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an **-OH group** (alcohol or carboxylic acid).
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of a **carbonyl group** (likely an ester or ketone) and possibly a **conjugated system** (e.g., an alkene).

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** confirm the presence of an **alkene group** in the compound.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of a smaller fragment, likely **C₂H₅O** (molecular weight = 45).

### Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):
The degree of unsaturation is calculated for each option:
- **C₆H₁₂O₂**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12 - 2)}{2} = 0
  \]
  This formula has no double bonds or rings, which contradicts the presence of vinyl hydrogens (indicating a double bond). Thus, this option is eliminated.

- **C₆H₁₀O**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10 - 1)}{2} = 1.5
  \]
  The degree of unsaturation is not an integer, making this formula invalid.

- **C₆H₁₀O₂**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10 - 2)}{2} = 1
  \]
  This formula has one degree of unsaturation, consistent with the presence of a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens).

- **C₆H₁₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12 - 1)}{2} = 0.5
  \]
  The degree of unsaturation is not an integer, making this formula invalid.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have **two oxygen atoms** (from the ester or ketone functional group and the -OH group), an **alkene** (from the vinyl hydrogens), and a **fragment at m/z = 45**. The formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** satisfies all the given data:
- It has one degree of unsaturation, consistent with the alkene.
- The molecular weight aligns with the observed fragment at m/z = 45.
- The functional groups (carbonyl and -OH) match the IR data.

Thus, the correct chemical formula is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

Answer: C
