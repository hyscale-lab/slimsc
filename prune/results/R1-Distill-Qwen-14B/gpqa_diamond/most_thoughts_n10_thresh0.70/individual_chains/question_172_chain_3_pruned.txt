Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let me think through it step by step.

So, the setup is that there are two stars, star_1 and star_2. In star_1, the iron atoms in the photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I should probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula I remember is (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. 

In this problem, star_1 has twice the excitation as star_2 for the same energy level. So for a specific energy level, let's say level 2, the population n_2 in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, both stars are talking about the same energy levels, right? So the energy difference Î”E is the same for both stars because it's the same transition.

Let me define the populations. Let n_1 be the population in star_1 and n_2 be that in star_2 for a particular energy level. The problem says n_1 = 2 n_2. 

Wait, wait. Wait, no, it's the excitation that's twice. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as much in star_1. Or perhaps, for a given energy level, the number of atoms in that level relative to another is twice. 

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous, but I think it means that the number of atoms in that specific excited level is twice as high in star_1 than in star_2. So if I'm considering two energy levels, say E1 and E2,
