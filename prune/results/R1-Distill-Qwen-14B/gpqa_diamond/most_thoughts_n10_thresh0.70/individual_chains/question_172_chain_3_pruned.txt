Okay, so I have this question about two stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait—excited in a specific energy level. I remember that in stars, the ionization and excitation states of atoms depend on the temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium (LTE, which the question states they are in). The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, wait, 1.38 ×10^-23 J. Oh wait, that's exactly the same as k (Boltzmann's constant) multiplied by 1 K. Because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So E = k ΔT or something? Not sure yet.

Wait, in the problem, the excitation level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Let me clarify: the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me denote the energy levels as E1 and E2, but wait, no, the problem says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So E_upper - E_lower = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the energy difference is given, so E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let me assume that in star_1, the lower state is j and the upper state is i. So the population ratio n_i/n_j in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, no. The problem states that the iron atoms in star
