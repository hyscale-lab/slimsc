Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the uncertainty in Pz given a specific state. 

So, the setup is that we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given in the problem. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which means the eigenstates of Pz are the basis here. 

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz^2⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩^2).

But wait, I should confirm. Yeah, the formula is ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ − ⟨A⟩²). Right.

So, first, I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

But wait, what is Pz in matrix form? Looking back, the matrix for Pz is:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, Pz is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait no, wait: the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So Pz is a 3x3 matrix with those entries.

The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that as a column vector: |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

Wait, but wait. I should check if this state is normalized. Let me compute the sum of squares of the absolute values.

So (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, (-1/2)^2 is 1/4. Sum
