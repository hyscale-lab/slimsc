Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite results in calculations. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through each option one by one.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I think regularization is needed when you have loop diagrams that lead to infinities. So, theories that don't have such divergences wouldn't need regularization. But wait, all the quantum theories I know have divergences, which is why we use renormalization. Oh, but the question is about which one never requires regularization, so maybe a theory that doesn't have those infinities in the first place.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is known for being renormalizable, but it still requires regularization because of the divergences in loop integrals. So C) probably isn't the answer since it does need regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is similar to QED but for the strong force. It's also a renormalizable theory but has issues like confinement and asymptotic freedom. I don't think it avoids regularization; it's just that in the high-energy (UV) limit, the coupling gets weaker, making perturbative calculations more manageable. But that doesn't mean no regularization is needed. So B) is likely not the right answer.

Classical Electrodynamics (D) is a non-quantum theory. Since it's classical, it doesn't have the same issues with infinities that quantum theories do. For example, the classical treatment of point charges has issues with self-energy and radiation reaction leading to the idea of the Lorentz–Abraham–Dirac force, but these are handled in different ways than regularization. Wait, but in classical ED, when you have things like point charges, the fields become singular at the charge's location. But does that require regularization? I'm not sure. Maybe in classical ED, you can just use the equations without regularization because it's a different kind of description. Or perhaps it's because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So maybe D) Classical Electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory needing renormalization techniques.

Superstring Theory (A) is a quantum theory, but it's a theory of strings instead of point particles.
