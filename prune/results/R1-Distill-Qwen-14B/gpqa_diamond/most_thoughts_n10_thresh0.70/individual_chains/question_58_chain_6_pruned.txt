Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities can cause problems, so you regularize the theory, maybe by introducing a cutoff or something, and then remove it later with renormalization.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this because it doesn't have such issues at high energies.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't really have the same problems as quantum ones because in classical physics, things are deterministic and you don't get these infinities in the same way. Oh wait, but wait a second. In classical electrodynamics, when you have point charges, you get issues like the infinite self-energy of a charge and the radiation reaction leading to infinite acceleration. But wait, don't these problems occur in the classical treatment when you try to calculate certain aspects, like the self-force?

But regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So in the realm of quantum theories, which ones require regularization? So the question is about the theories that are quantum in nature. So I can probably ignore D because it's classical.

So the options are A, B, C. Among these, which one doesn't require regularization.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a renormalizable theory. That means it can handle the divergences with renormalization. But does it require regularization? I think yes. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals, so you need a regularization scheme to handle them before renormalizing. So QED does require regularization steps.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is similar to QED but with a non-abelian gauge group. It's also renormalizable. But because of asymptotic freedom, at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling becomes weak, so perturbative methods work well. However, does it require regularization? I think yes, because QCD loops also produce divergences, so you still need regularization techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice methods.

Superstring Theory... string theory is supposed to be a
