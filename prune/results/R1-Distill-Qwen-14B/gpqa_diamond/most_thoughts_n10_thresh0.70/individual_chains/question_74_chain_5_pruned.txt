Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait a second. Oh, wait, the next 150 minutes—does that start from now or from the beginning? Oh, right, because 50 have already passed, so the remaining time would matter.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says, "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes." So that's after the current time, which is 50 minutes in. So the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes since the start. But wait, no. Because the 50 minutes have already passed without decay, so the next 150 is the period we're looking at. So the probability is about the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Radioactive decay, as far as I remember, follows an exponential law. The key equation is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, and λ is the decay constant. But wait, we're dealing with probabilities here. Since it's a single atom, the probability that
