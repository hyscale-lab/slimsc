Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the formation of more stable complexes. But β4 is lower than β3 here. That's interesting. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll go with what's given.

First, I need to understand what the complexes are. Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. The stability constant, β, tells us how stable each complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands. So, the possible species are Co²+ (n=0), Co(SCN)²+ (n=1), Co(SCN)_2²+ (n=2), Co(SCN)_3²+ (n=3), and Co(SCN)_4²+ (n=4). Wait, but the stability constants given are β1, β2, etc. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. But I should confirm the order.

Wait, the stability constants are for each step. So, β1 is the formation constant for the first complex: Co(SCN)²+, β2 is for the second (Co(SCN)_2²+), and so on. Or wait, sometimes the overall stability constant is for the overall reaction. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, perhaps each β is for the nth complex. So, the first complex is Co(SCN)²+, β1=9. The second complex is Co(SCN)_2²+, β2=40. The third is Co(SCN)_3²+, β3=63. The fourth is Co(SCN)_4²+, β4=16. But wait, β4 is lower than β3. That seems odd because each successive step adds a ligand, and if the complexes are more stable, we'd expect β to increase. Unless there's a change in the structure or some other factor.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me think: the overall formation of a complex with n ligands would have a formation constant which is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. For example, β_total for n=2 would be β1*β2, right? Or is each β the overall for that complex?

Hmm, I think each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So, β1 is the constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, no
