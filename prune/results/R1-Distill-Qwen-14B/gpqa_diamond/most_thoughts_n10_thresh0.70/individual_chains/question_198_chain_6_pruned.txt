Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Hmm, stability constants are the formation constants for the complexes. So, they tell us how stable each complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The complexes are formed in a stepwise manner, right? So, each β represents the formation of a complex with an additional SCN- ligand.

Wait, but what exactly are the complexes here? Let's clarify. The complexes are likely Co(SCN)_n^2-n where n is the number of SCN- ligands. So, for n=1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. But in this case, β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, and so on.

But wait, wait. The problem specifies the "blue dithiocyanato" complexes, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, which is blue. So the dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ligands. So we need to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^+ among all the Co species.

Wait, but how many complexes are possible here? Let's list them:

- Co^2+ (the free ion)
- Co(SCN)^+ (n=1)
- Co(SCN)_2^+ (n=2)
- Co(SCN)_3^2- (n=3)
- Co(SCN)_4^2- (n=4)

Wait, wait. No, the charge would be 2+ minus the number of SCN- times -1 each. So:

Co^2+ has 0 SCN-.

Each SCN- is -1. So:

n=1: CoSCN^+ (charge is 2+ -1 = +1)
n=2: Co(SCN)_2^0 (2+ -2 = 0)
Wait, wait, no: Wait,
