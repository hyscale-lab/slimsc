Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolate ions acting as nucleophiles attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think about each part of the question.

The question has three reactions labeled (A), (B), and (C), each with different reactants and conditions, and the options give possible products for each. I need to figure out which option correctly lists all the products.

Starting with reaction (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I think NaOEt is a base, probably deprotonating the malonate to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. When deprotonated, it forms an enolate at the beta position. So the enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which in this case is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait, no, the substituents: it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-O-(p-tolyl)? No, wait, no, wait, the substituent is at the third position. Oh, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH2R where R is p-tolyl? No, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think: the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- group attached to a methyl group? No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 where the CH2 group is attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, no. Alternatively, the structure is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe it's better to approach this via the mechanism.

In any case, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. So the acrylate has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so the enolate will attack the beta carbon. After the attack, the carbonyl oxygen will deprotonate, forming a new carbonyl group.

So the product A would be a conjugated enol ester or a tricarboxylate. When the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is a diester) attacks the acrylate, the product would be a tricarboxylate. Let me think: the enolate would be at the central carbon of malonate. When it attacks, it adds a new group at that position.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-. The enolate would be at the central CH, so when it attacks the acrylate (CH2=CH-CO-OCH3), the attack would add the malonate's alpha carbon to the beta position of the acrylate. So the product would be a trimethyl something tricarboxylate.

Looking at the options, option A for (A) is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. Let me visualize that. Propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have three ester groups: two on the first carbon and one on the third. The substituent is p-tolyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be OMe groups on carbons 1 and 3, and a p-tolyl group on carbon 2. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the central carbon that gets the p-tolyl group.

Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. The enolate from malonate attacks the beta position (the CH2 part). So after the addition, the structure would have the malonate's CH added to the CH2, and the COOCH3 comes from the acrylate.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this. Alternatively, maybe the product is a tricarboxylate where the middle carbon has the p-tolyl group. So the product would be something like CH2(COOCH3)2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, the product would be a six-membered ring? No, wait, no, in the Michael addition, it's a 1,4 addition. So the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the acrylate, which is the CH2 group in CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, no, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Or wait, maybe the substituent is on the alpha position.

Wait, I might be getting stuck here. Let me look at the options. The options for (A) are either trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate or trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.

Trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have the structure where the p-tolyl is on carbon 2, with ester groups on 1 and 3. So the structure would be OMe on C1, OMe on C3, and a p-tolyl on C2.

Alternatively, if the attack is on the acrylate's beta position, which is the CH2=CH- part, then the enolate adds to the CH2, which is the beta position. So the product would have the p-tolyl group on the adjacent carbon. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate where the three ester groups are on the same carbon, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, no, the product would be a longer chain. Let me think about the actual reaction.

The Michael addition of dimethyl malonate to methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the structure would be:

The enolate is CH2(COOCH3)2−. It attacks CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group attached to the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the enolate attacks the CH2, adding to the CH2 part.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

After attack, the product would have the malonate's CH2 attached to the CH2 of the acrylate, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate where the p-tolyl is on the second carbon, as in the options, so perhaps A is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which would be option A's A. So I'm leaning towards option A for (A).

Now, moving to reaction (B): 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile under MeOH and H3O+ conditions.

Wait, the piperidine derivative is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which I think is a cyclic enamine or something similar. Wait, cyclohex-1-en-1-yl is a cyclohexene ring where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent (piperidine) is at C1. So the structure is cyclohexene with a piperidine group attached to the same carbon as the double bond.

The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CH-CN. Wait, but wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2C≡N? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN, but wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH3CH2CH=CH-CN? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? Or perhaps it's CH2=CHCN, which is acrylonitrile? Wait, acrylonitrile is propenenitrile, CH2=CHCN. But but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2CN with a double bond between C2 and C3, so structure CH2CH2CN with double bond between the middle carbons. Wait, but wait, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN? No, but that's pentenynitrile perhaps. Alternatively, (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond starting at C2. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCN, which is acrylonitrile, but that's actually propenenitrile, not buten. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with the double bond between C2 and C3, so the structure would be CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between the two middle carbons, making it CH2=CHCH2CN. No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, but-2-enenitrile is (Z) or (E) isomer. So, structure is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, but that would be but-2-enenitrile: positions 2 and 3 have the double bond, with the nitrile group on position 4. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCN, which is propenenitrile, but perhaps that's what it is.

But let me think about the reaction. The starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Piperidine is a six-membered amine ring, so 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl) would mean the cyclohexene is attached to the piperidine's nitrogen. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond and a piperidine group at the same position as the double bond.

When reacting with (E)-but-2-enenitrile, perhaps the enamine acts as a nucleophile. Wait, but I'm not sure if piperidine would form an enamine in this case. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, but the reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is a dienophile. Wait, but the conditions are MeOH and H3O+; that's acidic conditions. Hmm, maybe it's a Michael addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine derivative acts as a base, deprotonating the but-2-enenitrile to form an enolate. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, which doesn't have an alpha proton to the nitrile. Wait, CH2=CHCH2CN: the alpha position is CH2, but the nitrile is on the end. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the enamine from the piperidine compound acts as a nucleophile. Enamines are known to undergo conjugate additions to alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyls, but in this case, the other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Hmm, but nitriles aren't typically electrophilic enough for Michael additions, but perhaps under certain conditions they can act as electrophiles.

Wait, the structure of but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, but that's but-2-enenitrile. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN. The enamine (from the piperidine compound) would attack the beta position (the CH2 next to the double bond) of the but-2-enenitrile. So the product would have the cyclohexenyl-piperidine group attached to the CH2 that was attacked.

Wait, but wait, the nitrile is at the end. So the Michael addition would add the enamine's nucleophile to the beta position, which is the CH2 between the double bond and the nitrile. So the product would have the structure where the enamine's carbon is attached to that CH2. So the product would be 3-(2-cyclohexenylpiperidin-1-yl)butanenitrile? Or wait, perhaps the product is 3-(cyclohexenylpiperidinyl)butanenitrile.

Wait, the options for (B) are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, but wait, the product would have the cyclohexenylpiperidine group attached to the butanenitrile. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at option B for (B), it's 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. 2-oxocyclohexyl would mean a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 2. Hmm, but the starting material is a cyclohexene ring attached to piperidine. So perhaps under acidic conditions, the enamine would hydrolyze back to the ketone.

Wait, the reaction conditions are MeOH and H3O+, which are acidic. So after the Michael addition, perhaps the enamine would protonate, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which would then get attacked by the nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the enamine addition leads to a new carbon-carbon bond, and then under acidic conditions, the ring is opened or a ketone is formed.

Wait, perhaps the piperidine is part of an enamine, which reacts with the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. The enamine would attack the beta position of the nitrile's alpha-beta unsaturated system. So the product would have the cyclohexenylpiperidine attached to the CH2 next to the nitrile.

But wait, the options don't have piperidine in the product. Instead, they have cyclohexyl groups. So perhaps after the reaction, the piperidine is somehow transformed. Alternatively, maybe the piperidine is deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a nitrile with a cyclohexenyl group attached. Looking at the options, option B for (B) is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. But where does the 2-oxocyclohexyl come from?

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring, after the addition, undergoes some change. Let me think. If the piperidine is part of an enamine, the addition would form a new ring. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is part of the product as a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe looking at the product structure will help. Option (B) in the options is either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

If the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, that would imply that the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 2, attached to the butanenitrile at position 3. So the structure would be CH2CH2CN with a substituent on the third carbon being cyclohexanone (but at position 2).

But I'm not sure how this comes from the starting materials. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is converted into a cyclohexanone ring via some tautomerism or ring opening under the reaction conditions.

Wait, the starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So the cyclohexene ring is connected to the piperidine's nitrogen. When the enamine attacks the but-2-enenitrile, perhaps the product is a new compound where the piperidine's carbon is attached to the butenynitrile's CH2. Then, under acidic conditions, the piperidine ring might open or rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound. But I'm not making much progress here.

Let me think about the conditions: MeOH and H3O+. That's acidic conditions, which could lead to protonation of the enamine, leading to a carbocation, which might undergo ring opening or other reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a conjugate addition, and then the piperidine group is somehow transformed. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring remains and the product is a larger molecule.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile. That would mean a hydroxyl group on the cyclohexene ring at position 2. But how would that form?

Hmm, perhaps the attack leads to a new structure, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should move to reaction (C) and see if that helps.

Reaction (C): C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the cyclohexane has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3, and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group. The 3-oxobutyl is CH2CH2CO- attached to the cyclohexane.

But wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(H)COCH3. Or is it CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Wait, but-3-en-2-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, but but-3-en-2-one would have the ketone at C2 and the double bond between C3 and C4. So structure: CH2=C(O)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C-CH2-C=O? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2CO with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one would be:

Structure: CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be right because the double bond can't be after the ketone. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C-C(O)-CH3. Wait, that would be but-1-en-3-one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: but-3-en-2-one. The but chain is four carbons. The ketone is at position 2, and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure would be CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? That would make it CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3, which would be but-1-en-3-one, but the question says but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, perhaps it's CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)COCH2CH2, but I'm stuck. Let me think about the reaction.

The reactant is but-3-en-2-one and C (another compound). The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the product has a cyclohexane ring with two ketones (1 and 3 positions) and a substituent at position 2 which is 3-oxobutyl. The 3-oxobutyl is CH2-CH2-CO-.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Hmm, maybe it's CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4, which would be CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2. No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C-CH2-C=O? So the structure is CH2=C-CH2-C=O, which would be but-1-en-4-one, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, but that would be but-2-en-3-one, which doesn't match the name given.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one refers to CH2=C-O-C-O-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think about the product structure. The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the substituent is a butyl group with an oxo group at the third position.

But substituent would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane at position 2. So the substituent is -(CH2)2CO-.

Wait, but the starting material is but-3-en-2-one, which would have a double bond. So how does that react with cyclohexane-1,3-dione under KOH and H2O?

Wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH3? No, that would be but-1-en-3-one. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2, but that's five carbons. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cyclohexane-1,3-dione (which is a diketone) undergoing a Michael addition with itself. But the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So perhaps the reactant C is another cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between cyclohexane-1,3-dione and but-3-en-2-one under basic conditions. The enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (but-3-en-2-one) in a Michael addition.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one would have a structure like CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2. No, I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one would have the ketone at C2 and the double bond between C3 and C4, so the structure would be CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that would make it CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons, but that's impossible because the fourth carbon isn't present. Hmm, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C=O with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible in a four-carbon chain.

I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think about the product again.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a butyl group (four carbons) with a ketone at position 3. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CO-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CO-. So the product would be cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a -(CH2)2CO- group attached at position 2.

So, the reaction must be adding this substituent to the cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

If the starting material is but-3-en-2-one, perhaps it's acting as the Michael acceptor, and the nucleophile is the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

In a Michael addition, the enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (but-3-en-2-one). So, the enolate would add to the double bond, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

But but-3-en-2-one (if it's CH2=C-O-C-O-CH3, which I'm not sure), but perhaps the structure allows for the attack. After the attack, the product would have the cyclohexane ring attached to the CH2 group from the enolate and the carbonyl group from the butenone.

So, the product would have the cyclohexane-1,3-dione attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2-CO group, making the substituent -(CH2)2CO-.

Thus, the product would be 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which matches the description.

So, what is the starting material C? The reactants are C and but-3-en-2-one, and the product is that. So C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But wait, no, because the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the starting material C would be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the other reactant is but-3-en-2-one. Thus, the reaction is a Michael addition between the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione and the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl but-3-en-2-one.

So, now looking at the options for (C). The options for (C) are either 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione or cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but in the reaction, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the starting material C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione (since it's being added to the butenone). So, in option C, the product (C) is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. But in the reaction, the product is the substituted cyclohexane, so I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the starting material C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The other reactant is but-3-en-2-one.

So, in the reaction, the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the butenone, forming the product. So the product is a larger molecule, but the options for (C) only list cyclohexane-1,3-dione or 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, maybe the product isn't (C) but the other way around. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The third reaction is C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, C is a reactant, along with but-3-en-2-one, and the product is the substituted cyclohexane. Therefore, C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options, which option lists C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione? Let's check each option.

Option A: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option D: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So options B and C have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which matches our analysis.

Now, recapping reaction (A) and (B).

Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate → product A. The options for (A) are either trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate or trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate.

We thought it was the former, which is option A for (A).

Reaction (B): 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile → product B. The options are either 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Hmm, perhaps under acidic conditions, the enamine would form a carbocation, leading to a rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, which would come from the cyclohexene ring attaching to the nitrile compound.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which would imply that the cyclohexene ring becomes a ketone.

Wait, if the starting material is a cyclohexene ring attached to piperidine, and the product has a cyclohexyl group with a ketone (2-oxocyclohexyl), perhaps the piperidine ring has been hydrolyzed under the acidic conditions to form a ketone. So, the addition would proceed with the enamine attacking the nitrile's alpha-beta unsaturated system, then protonation and ring opening.

But I'm not certain. Looking at the options, option B for (B) is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and option D has 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

So, considering the reaction conditions are MeOH and H3O+ (acidic), perhaps the piperidine's enamine would protonate, leading to a carbocation, which could then lose a proton to form a double bond, leading to a cyclohexanone. Thus, the product would have a 2-oxocyclohexyl group.

So, product B would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (option B for (B)).

Now, putting it all together:

For reaction (A), product is A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Reaction (B), product B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Reaction (C), product C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Looking at the options:

Option B: A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate; B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile; C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: A is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate; B is 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile; C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but according to my analysis, product (A) is the first option, product (B) is the first option, and product (C) is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So only option B fits.

Wait, but in option B, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which matches, and (B) is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

So, the correct option would be option B.


The question involves analyzing three Michael addition reactions and determining the correct products based on the given reactants and reaction conditions. Here's the breakdown:

### Reaction (A): Dimethyl Malonate + Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → (A)
- **Reactants**: Dimethyl malonate is a diester with the structure $(CH_3COO)_2CH-$. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate ion.
- **Electrophile**: Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has an α-β unsaturated carbonyl group, making it a good Michael acceptor.
- **Mechanism**: The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The product is a resonance-stabilized tricarboxylate.
- **Product**: The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, where the p-tolyl group is attached to the second carbon of the tricarboxylate chain.

### Reaction (B): 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + MeOH, H₃O⁺ → (B)
- **Reactants**: 1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine contains a cyclohexene ring attached to a piperidine group. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an α-β unsaturated nitrile.
- **Mechanism**: Under acidic conditions (MeOH, H₃O⁺), the enamine intermediate reacts with the α-β unsaturated nitrile. The enamine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the nitrile.
- **Product**: The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, where the cyclohexene ring is converted into a cyclohexanone (2-oxocyclohexyl) group under the reaction conditions.

### Reaction (C): C + But-3-en-2-one + KOH, H₂O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
- **Reactants**: The starting material $C$ is identified as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, a diketone. But-3-en-2-one is an α-β unsaturated ketone.
- **Mechanism**: The enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione reacts with the α-β unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one) in a Michael addition. The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the butenone.
- **Product**: The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, where the cyclohexane ring has a 3-oxobutyl substituent at the second carbon.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: Incorrect because it lists $C$ as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the reaction.
- **Option B**: Correct. It lists $A$ as trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, $B$ as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and $C$ as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, all of which match the analysis.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because it lists $A$ as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which does not match the reaction.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it lists $C$ as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the reaction.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **B**, as it accurately identifies the products of all three reactions.

**Answer: B**
