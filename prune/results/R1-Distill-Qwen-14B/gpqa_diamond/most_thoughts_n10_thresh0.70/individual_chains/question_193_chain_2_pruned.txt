Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So N ~ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different r dependencies.

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to work through it. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle in arcseconds, and distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal, right? So d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So if I know that N varies with 1/plx^5, I can express this in terms of distance. Let's substitute d into the equation. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ~ d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of r. So I think we're looking at the number density, like the number per unit distance. So maybe I need to find the derivative of N with respect to r or something like that.

Wait, let me clarify. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So more stars when plx is small, meaning when distance is large. Wait, no—if plx is small (because d is large), then 1/plx^5 is large, so N is large. So as distance increases, N increases?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about it. Suppose I observe a certain region of the sky. The number of stars I see depends on how many are within a certain distance. If the number varies as 1/plx^5, that suggests that the number increases as the distance increases, but I'm not sure. Let me model it.

So N ~ 1/plx^5 = (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that would mean that as d increases, N increases a lot. But that doesn't make sense because as you look further away, the density of stars in that direction (per unit volume) decreases, right? But wait, maybe not. Because if more stars are at larger distances, but spread out more, the count depends on how the density changes.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. The volume of a shell is 4π r² dr. The number of stars in that shell would depend on the density of stars at that distance. If the density (stars per volume) is n(r), then the number of stars in the shell is n(r) * 4π r² dr.

But the question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me think about what that implies for the density. Hmm, perhaps I need
