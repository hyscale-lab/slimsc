Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that's unstable and decays quickly.

The given data are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D with different distances in meters, all around 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So, I'm thinking about how to calculate the mean decay distance.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that comes from the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean lifetime is related to the width, and then multiplied by the velocity to get the distance. The formula I recall is something like c multiplied by the lifetime. But how do I get the lifetime from the width?

Oh, right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, which means τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, actually, I think the relation is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that makes sense because a larger width (Γ) means a shorter lifetime, which aligns with being more unstable.

So step one: calculate the lifetime τ using Γ. But wait, the production energy E is given, and the mass m is given. Oh wait, because the particle is produced with some energy, perhaps we need to find its velocity. Because the mean decay distance is L = v * τ.

Wait, but the particle's mass is given, and its energy. So perhaps I need to find its velocity from E and m.

The energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But we can compute γ as E/(m_X c²) since m_X is 1.2 GeV. Wait, let me check units. The energy is in GeV, mass in GeV/c², because E=mc². So m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², so when we compute E/(m c²), E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 /
