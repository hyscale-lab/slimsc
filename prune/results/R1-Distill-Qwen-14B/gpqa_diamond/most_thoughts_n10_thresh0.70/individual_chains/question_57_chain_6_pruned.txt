Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for electron elastic scattering. Hmm, I remember that the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Let me think about what I learned in my nuclear physics class.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) involves a sum over all the phase shifts δ_l. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ ( (l + 1/2) (δ_l) ) / (sin δ_l) ) * ( (4π)/(2l+1) ) * ... ] Wait, maybe I'm getting the exact form wrong. Alternatively, I think it's f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ ( (l + 1/2) ) * sin(δ_l) ) / ( (2l+1) ) ) ] times some Legendre polynomial? Or wait, maybe it's different. Oh wait, no, maybe it's more straightforward.

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the optical theorem. Or wait, no, maybe the imaginary part is related to the phase shifts themselves. Oh, right, for each partial wave, the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is proportional to sin δ_l. Because the scattering amplitude can be written as f = f_real + i f_imag, and the imaginary part comes from the phase shifts.

Wait, the general expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is f(θ) = ∑ [ ( ( (l + 1) * sin δ_l ) / ( (2l +
