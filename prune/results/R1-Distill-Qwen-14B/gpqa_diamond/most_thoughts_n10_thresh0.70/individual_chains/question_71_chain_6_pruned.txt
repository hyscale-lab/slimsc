Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out. The question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, and they're in orbital resonance with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The options are A to D.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I think the formula might also involve the square root of the inverse of the semi-major axis. Or was it the inverse? Let me think.

Oh, the basic formula is T_eq = T_star * (L / (16πσa²))^1/4. Wait, no, that might be the flux. Maybe I should approach it differently. The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), assuming the planet reflects some of the light (albedo), but since all planets have the same albedo, that factor might cancel out.

Wait, no. The equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * ( (1
