Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanisms, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question gives three different reactions labeled A, B, and C, and asks for the products. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for each reaction. I need to figure out which option correctly pairs the reactants with their major products.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate are reacting under NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition typically involves a nucleophilic enolate attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So in this case, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The acceptor is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, how does the enolate form here? Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so when deprotonated, it forms a conjugate base. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. The acrylate has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the attack would be at carbon 2 (the beta position), right?

So when the enolate attacks, the acrylate's double bond breaks, and the enolate's negative charge would connect to the beta carbon. Let me visualize the structure. The acrylate is CH2=CH-Ph-p-tolyl (but with ester groups on the ends?), wait no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate structure: the molecule is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me. So in this case, the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So substituting the CH2 with p-tolyl? No, the numbering would be 3, so the structure would be CH2=C-p-tolyl? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=C-(p-tolyl) in the middle. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C-(p-tolyl) attached to the acrylate.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl is on carbon 2, making it an alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta
