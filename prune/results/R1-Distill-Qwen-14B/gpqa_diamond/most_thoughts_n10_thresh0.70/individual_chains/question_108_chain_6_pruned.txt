Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about magnetic fields and the hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

Alright, the setup: there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. They mentioned small m values for the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, which for orbitals is from -l to +l in integer steps. Oh right, and for hydrogen, the energy levels mainly depend on the principal quantum number n.

The paramagnetic coupling term—I think that refers to the Hamiltonian term due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. Oh yeah, the Zeeman effect. So the Zeeman term is part of the Hamiltonian, and it's given by something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

Wait, the magnetic moment for an electron is μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, if the problem is talking about orbital magnetic quantum number m, then maybe it's considering the orbital contribution. Oh, but wait, the orbital and spin contributions are different. Oh wait, no, the orbital part comes from angular momentum, so maybe the paramagnetic term here is the orbital part. Or maybe the problem is using m as the spin magnetic number. Hmm, the question says m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, so I think it's referring to the orbital contribution.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is typically denoted by m_l, which can take values from -l to +l. But when we talk about the magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum, the formula is μ = (eħ/(2m_e)) * (L_z)/(ħ) ) * something. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (μ_B) * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the magnetic moment is proportional to m_l. So the Zeeman energy would be H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, which is the same direction as L_z, the energy is H = -μ_B
