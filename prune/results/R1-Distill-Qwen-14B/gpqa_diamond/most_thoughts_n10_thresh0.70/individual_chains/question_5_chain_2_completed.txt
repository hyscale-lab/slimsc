Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The options give different possible eigenvectors, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that the operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given in the problem. Let me jot them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

P_y is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

And P_z is (ħ/2) times:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the vector is in the x-z plane. So it's something like (x, 0, z). To find the operator P along n, I need to construct the operator P · n where n is a unit vector. Wait, no, wait. The operator is P in the direction of n, which I think is (P · n) where n is a unit vector. Since n is along x-z, let's say n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would mean θ is the polar angle, and phi (φ) is the azimuthal angle, which would be 0 here since it's in x-z.

So the operator for the direction n would be P_n = (P · n̂) = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. The unit vector n can be expressed in terms of the spherical coordinates. If it's in the x-z plane, then the y-component is zero. So n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in x-z, φ would be 0, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So yes, n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P along n is P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

So let's compute that.

First, let's write P_x and P_z as matrices.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P·n = (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix elements:

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2) * (cosθ * 1) since in P_z, the (1,1) is 1*(ħ/2), multiplied by cosθ, and P_x doesn't contribute anything there.

The (1,2) element is (ħ/2) * sinθ from P_x.

Similarly, (2,1) is (ħ/2) sinθ.

The (2,2) element is (ħ/2) * (-cosθ).

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
  [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

So now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Eigenvector equation: P·n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

So let's set up the eigenvalue equation. Let's denote the matrix as M.

M = [ [ a, b ],
       [ b*, c ] ] Wait, no, in this case, the matrix is real, except for maybe some i's in the off-diagonal terms, but in this case, since P·n is a real operator? Wait, because P_x and P_z are real, so their combination would be real. Yeah, because sinθ and cosθ are real, so the matrix is real.

Wait, no, because the P_x matrix is real, but in the general case, when combining with different components, the resulting operator could have complex entries. Wait, in this specific case, since P_x is real and we're combining it with real coefficients, the resulting matrix is real. So the matrix M is real.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

M |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Where |v> is a two-component vector [v1, v2]^T.

So the matrix equation is:

( (ħ/2 cosθ ) v1 + (ħ/2 sinθ ) v2 ) = (ħ/2) v1
( (ħ/2 sinθ ) v1 - (ħ/2 cosθ ) v2 ) = (ħ/2) v2

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

Equation 1:
cosθ v1 + sinθ v2 = v1

Equation 2:
sinθ v1 - cosθ v2 = v2

Let me rearrange both equations.

Equation 1:
(cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

Equation 2:
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Wait, equation 2 rearrangement:

sinθ v1 - cosθ v2 = v2
=> sinθ v1 = (cosθ + 1) v2

So, equation 2: sinθ v1 = (1 + cosθ) v2

Similarly, equation 1: (cosθ - 1) v1 + sinθ v2 =0.

Hmm, let's see if these equations are consistent.

Wait, perhaps I can express v2 from equation 2 and substitute into equation 1.

From equation 2: v2 = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ) ] v1

Substitute into equation 1:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ [ sinθ/(1 + cosθ) ) v1 ] = 0

Factor out v1:

[ (cosθ -1) + ( sin²θ )/(1 + cosθ) ) ] v1 = 0

Let me compute the bracket term.

First, (cosθ -1) can be written as -(1 - cosθ).

So, -(1 - cosθ) + ( sin²θ )/(1 + cosθ )

Let me combine the terms. Let's find a common denominator of (1 + cosθ):

= [ -(1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) + sin²θ ] / (1 + cosθ )

Expanding numerator:

= [ -(1 - cos²θ) + sin²θ ] / (1 + cosθ )

Because (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) = 1 - cos²θ.

Wait, so:

= [ -(1 - cos²θ) + sin²θ ] / (1 + cosθ )

But 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ, so:

= [ -sin²θ + sin²θ ] / (1 + cosθ ) ) 

Which is zero. So the bracket is zero, so the equation is satisfied for any v1 as long as equation 2 holds. That means the two equations are not independent; thus, we have a one-parameter solution.

So, from equation 2: v2 = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ) ] v1

Let me write this as v2 = [ sinθ / (1 + cosθ) ] v1

We can factor this. Remember that sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), and 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2). So,

v2 = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 cos²(theta/2) ) ) ] v1 

Simplify:

= [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ) ] v1

= tan(theta/2) v1

So v2 = tan(theta/2) v1

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2] = [v1, tan(theta/2) v1 ] = v1 [1, tan(theta/2) ]

We can factor v1 out, so the eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(theta/2) ]

But wait, I'm a bit confused because theta is the angle from the z-axis. So theta is the polar angle, right?

Alternatively, perhaps I should parameterize the eigenvectors in terms of spin states. Spin-1/2 systems have eigenvectors corresponding to up or down in a particular direction.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a spin-1/2 particle. The operator P is the spin operator multiplied by ħ/2. So the eigenvectors are spin-up and spin-down along the direction n.

The standard spin-up state along direction (sinθ, 0, cosθ) is given by the spherical basis. The spin-up state can be written as:

|up> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But in this case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0.

So |up> would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, that's an option. Let me look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but normalized.

Wait, but the eigenvector we found earlier is proportional to [1, tan(theta/2) ].

Let me compute that.

We have v = [1, tan(theta/2) ] = [ cos(theta/2) / cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ]

Wait, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), and 1 = cos(theta/2)/cos(theta/2).

So v = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] / cos(theta/2)

Wait, but then the norm is sqrt( [cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2)] ) / cos(theta/2) ) = sqrt(1) / cos(theta/2) ) = 1/cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by cos(theta/2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute the normalization.

The vector is [ a, b ] where a = 1, b = tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2).

So the norm squared is (1)^2 + (sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2))^2 = [ cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] / cos^2(theta/2) ) = 1 / cos^2(theta/2).

So the norm is 1 / |cos(theta/2)|.

Thus, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by cos(theta/2) to make the norm 1.

Wait, wait, let's see:

If v = [1, tan(theta/2) ], then the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( 1 + tan^2(theta/2) ) ) = 1 / sqrt( sec^2(theta/2) ) ) = cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2) * 1, cos(theta/2) * tan(theta/2) ] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so multiplying by cos(theta/2) gives sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but that's only if phi is zero. Because in the general case, phi would contribute a phase factor, but since in this problem the direction is along x-z, phi is zero. So the state is real.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems to be the standard spherical harmonic but without the 1/2 angle.

So the correct normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ). That looks like a specific case, perhaps when theta is 45 degrees or something, but not the general case.

Option B: (cos theta, e^{i phi} sin theta). This seems like a possible vector, but it's the wrong angle. The correct parameterization should involve theta/2.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)). This could be a case where the vector is normalized with some coefficients, but not the general case. Plus, the presence of ħ is confusing because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are generally dimensionless since operators have dimensions and the eigenvalues carry the dimensions. So the presence of ħ in the options A and D seems odd. Because the eigenvectors should be normalized, so their elements have to be dimensionless.

Hmm, that makes me think that options A and D are incorrect because they have ħ in them, but the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector. So the correct option should not have ħ in it.

Which leaves options B and C.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). But as I said, the correct parameterization uses theta/2, not theta. So option C is the correct one.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as follows:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta.
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we compute:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \, | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting the matrix $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, the equations become:

1. $(\cos\theta - 1) v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0$,  
2. $\sin\theta v_1 - (\cos\theta + 1) v_2 = 0$.

From these, we find that $v_2 = \tan(\theta/2) v_1$. Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
| \psi \rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize this vector, we compute the normalization factor:

\[
\sqrt{1 + \tan^2(\theta/2)} = \sqrt{\sec^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{|\cos(\theta/2)|}.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This is a specific case and does not represent the general eigenvector. Additionally, the presence of $\hbar$ is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.

- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This is not correct because the parameterization uses $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$, which is required for the correct spin-1/2 eigenvector.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived normalized eigenvector and is consistent with the spin-1/2 formalism.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  While this resembles a normalized vector, the presence of $\hbar$ is incorrect, and it does not represent the general case.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.

**Answer: C**
