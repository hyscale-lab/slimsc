Hmm, okay, I've got this problem about quantum mechanics, specifically about calculating the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a particular outcome. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized, right? The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that. The components are -1, 2, 1. Squaring them gives 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up: 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That's a problem because probabilities are calculated from the state vector, which must be normalized. So maybe I should normalize it first.

Wait, but the question is about an observable P, and we're measuring it. The observable is given by the matrix P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix P is a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, but what do I know about the observable? Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The transpose of P would swap elements across the diagonal. For P to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Looking at the elements:

The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) is also 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2). The diagonal elements are all zero, so their conjugates are the same. So yes, P is Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

Now, the question is to find the probability that measuring P yields 0. Hmm, how do we approach this?

In quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them.

So let's find the eigenvalues of P. To find eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So the matrix P - λ I would be:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ    1/sqrt(2)   0     |
| 1/sqrt(2)  -λ    1/sqrt(2) |
| 0     1/sqrt(2)  -λ |

Let me compute this determinant. Since the matrix is 3x3, I'll expand along the first row.

det = (-λ) * det[ [-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ] ] 
       - (1/sqrt(2)) * det[ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], [0, -λ] ]
       + 0 * det[ ... ] (which is zero, so we can ignore it)

So first term: (-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
= (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ] 
= - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) 
= (λ/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))) ) 
= λ / 2

So putting it together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2)

Expanding the first term: -λ³ + (λ * 1/2 )

So overall equation:
-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0
Combine like terms: -λ³ + λ = 0
Factor: λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, and -λ² +1=0 => λ²=1 => λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the expansion because I might have made a mistake. Let me recompute the determinant.

Wait, the first minor determinant is for the element at (1,1), which is -λ. The minor matrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3:

Row 2: -λ, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 1/sqrt(2), -λ

So determinant of this 2x2 is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) = λ² - 1/2.

So the first term is (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2 ) = -λ³ + (λ/2).

The second term is the element (1,2) which is 1/sqrt(2). The minor is the determinant of the matrix when we remove row 1 and column 2. So the minor is:

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, -λ

Wait, no. Wait, when we remove row 1 and column 2, the minor is:

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]? Wait no, no, the P - λ I matrix is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ

So when we take the minor for element (1,2), which is 1/sqrt(2), the minor is the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. So the minor matrix is:

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, -λ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the minor for (1,2) is the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 2. So the elements are:

Row 2, column 1: 1/sqrt(2), column 3: 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3, column 1: 0, column 3: -λ

So the minor is:

[1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]

[0, -λ]

So the determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = (-λ)/sqrt(2).

So the second term in the determinant expansion is:

- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) ) ] 

Wait, the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) multiplied by the minor. Since 1+2=3, which is odd, the cofactor sign is negative. So the term is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) * [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Wait no, wait. The expansion is:

sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_ij * M_ij 

Where M_ij is the minor.

In this case, i=1, j=2. So (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1.

So the term is (element) * (-1)^{i+j} * minor.

So the second term is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ]

Wait no, wait. The element is a_12 = 1/sqrt(2).

Minor M_12 is the determinant we calculated: (-λ)/sqrt(2).

So the term is a_12 * (-1)^{1+2} * M_12.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)^3 * (-λ/sqrt(2)) 

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) * (-λ/sqrt(2))

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (λ/sqrt(2)) )

= (λ) / (2)

So the determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2 )

= (-λ^3 + λ/2 ) + (λ/2 )

= -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2 )

= -λ^3 + λ 

So the equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 

Or λ^3 - λ = 0 

Which factors as λ(λ^2 - 1) = 0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but I thought that the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. So P can have eigenvalues 0, 1, and -1. So if we measure P, the possible results are 0, 1, or -1.

The question is to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue depends on the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenspace.

So to find the probability of getting 0, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and compute the squared norm of the projection of the state vector onto that eigenspace.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

For λ=0, the matrix (P - 0 I) is P itself. So we need to solve P |v> = 0.

So let me write the equations for (P - 0 I) |v> = 0, which is P |v> = 0.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So the equations are:

1) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0

2) (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0

3) 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0

From equation 1 and 3, v2=0.

From equation 2, v1 + v3=0 → v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) = v1 (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Wait, the system of equations:

Equation 1: v2 = 0.

Equation 2: v1 + v3 = 0.

Equation 3: v2 = 0.

So yes, v2=0, and v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the state vector of the system is given as (-1, 2, 1). But earlier I noticed it's not normalized. Because (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6 → norm squared is 6. So the state vector is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector. So perhaps the given state is (-1, 2, 1), but actually, it's normalized by dividing by sqrt(6). Because |ψ> has to satisfy <ψ|ψ>=1.

So the actual state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional and spanned by (1, 0, -1), which I'll call |v>, we can compute the projection.

The projection of |ψ> onto |v> is given by ( |v> <v|ψ> ) / <v|v> )

Wait, alternatively, the projection amplitude is the inner product of |v> and |ψ>, and the probability is the square of the absolute value of that.

Wait, but wait, |v> is (1,0,-1), and the state is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

The inner product <v | ψ> is (1, 0, -1) · ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6) )

= [ (1)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ] / sqrt(6)

= [ (-1) + 0 + (-1) ] / sqrt(6) 

= (-2) / sqrt(6)

The absolute value squared is ( (-2)/sqrt(6) )² = (4)/(6) = 2/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 is 2/3.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is correct.

But let me think: the observable P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. The projection of the state onto each eigenspace gives the probability for each outcome.

So the eigenvectors for 0 are (1,0,-1), for 1 and -1 I need to find their eigenspaces, but the question only asks about the probability of getting 0.

So the probability is 2/3, which is option A.

Wait, let me check the options again:

A) 2/3

B) 1

C)1/3

D) sqrt(2/3)

So the correct answer is A) 2/3.


To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the value \( 0 \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information
1. **State Vector**: The state of the system is given as \( (-1, 2, 1) \). However, this is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:
   \[
   \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state vector is:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Observable Matrix \( P \)**:
   \[
   P = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   \( P \) is Hermitian, as required for an observable.

3. **Eigenvalues of \( P \)**: The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). This yields:
   \[
   \lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
   \]
   The eigenvalue \( \lambda = 0 \) corresponds to the measurement outcome \( 0 \).

4. **Eigenspace for \( \lambda = 0 \)**: Solving \( P |v\rangle = 0 \), the eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \) are of the form:
   \[
   |v\rangle = v_1 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},
   \]
   where \( v_1 \) is a scalar. Thus, the eigenspace for \( \lambda = 0 \) is one-dimensional, spanned by \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

5. **Projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto the Eigenspace**: The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the norm of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto the eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \). The projection is calculated using the inner product:
   \[
   \langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{(-1) + 0 + (-1)}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{6}}.
   \]
   The absolute value squared is:
   \[
   \left| \frac{-2}{\sqrt{6}} \right|^2 = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}.
   \]

### Conclusion
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
