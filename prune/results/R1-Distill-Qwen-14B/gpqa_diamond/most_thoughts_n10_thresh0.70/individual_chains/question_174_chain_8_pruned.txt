Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the classical approximation of it.

Wait, okay, let's break this down. So initially, the nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Because momentum is conserved in explosions as well.

So, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after fission is zero. That means the momenta of the two fragments must cancel each other out.

I think I should model this using relativistic mechanics because the masses are changing and the kinetic energies might be significant. But wait, the question also asks about the classical approximation, so I need to compare the two.

Let me start by figuring out the rest masses of the two fragments. The total initial rest mass is M, but the sum of the two fragments is 0.99M. So the mass lost is 1% of M. But in nuclear reactions, that 1% is converted into kinetic energy, right? So the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect.

Wait, but the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So, the rest masses of the two fragments are m1 and m2, such that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Also, one is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 = 2 m2.

So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

But m1 = 2 m2, so substituting:

2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M.

So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M. Wait, but wait, 0.66 + 0.33 is 0.99
