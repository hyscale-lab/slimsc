Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. Hmm, the question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Let me think through this.

Wait, so the aperture is an N-sided polygon, right? And all the apothems are of length a. Apothems... Oh right, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, all apothems are the same, which makes sense.

The light is monochromatic and traveling along the z-axis, hitting the aperture vertically. So this is a diffraction problem. The far field region implies we're looking at the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern. Fraunhofer diffraction occurs when the source and the aperture are in focus at infinity, so the pattern is formed on a distant screen.

When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, what's the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture? I remember that the central maximum is surrounded by rings of minima and maxima. The minima occur at specific angles theta. The formula for the minima in a circular aperture is based on the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle, but wait, the question is about the first two minima.

Wait, no, the first minimum after the central maximum in a circular aperture is at a particular angle. Let me recall: the minima occur where the Bessel function J1 has its zeros. The first zero of J1 is at about 3.8317, but wait, wait. Actually, the minima in the far field for a circular aperture occur at angles given by a*sin(theta) = p*lambda, where p is an integer, but wait, no, isn't it that the minima are when the argument of the Bessel function is an integer multiple of pi?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Airy disk. The central bright spot is surrounded by dark rings. The first dark ring occurs at an angle where a*sin(theta) = 1.22 *
