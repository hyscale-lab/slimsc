Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that entropy is related to black holes through something called the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to find the area first.

The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. The distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. Oh wait, and θ is 10^-17 degrees. So I should probably use the small angle approximation to find the diameter or radius of the event horizon.

Small angle approximation says that θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the arc length divided by the radius. So θ ≈ (diameter)/(2d). Wait, let me get that right. The formula is θ (radians) ≈ (diameter)/(distance). No, wait, the formula is θ ≈ (size)/(distance), where size is the actual linear size. So if θ is in radians, size is approximately θ * d.

Wait, no, the exact formula for the angular diameter is θ = (actual size)/(distance). But since the angle is so small, we can approximate θ (in radians) ≈ actual size / distance. So the actual size (diameter) would be θ_rad * d.

But wait, θ given is in degrees. So I'll need to convert that to radians first. Let's see, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees * π/180. That would be (1e-17) * (3.1416/180) ≈ 1.744e-19 radians. Wait, 1e-17 * π/(180) ≈ (3.1416e-17)/(180) ≈ 1.745e-19, yeah.

So the diameter D of the event horizon is θ_rad * d. The distance d is in parsecs, right? So I'll need to convert that to meters. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parse
