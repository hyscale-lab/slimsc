Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. There are three products formed: product 1, product 2, and product 3. I need to figure out the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum. The options are various splitting patterns like triplet, triplet of triplets, etc. 

Let me go through each step one by one.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. Hmm, I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they can undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, to form an alkene. So this reaction is probably an E2 elimination, which would create an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons. So the product would be adamantylene or something similar, but more accurately, probably an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh wait, no, wait—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions might be adjacent in some way. Wait, no, I think in adamantane, each carbon is connected in a diamond lattice. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons that are not directly connected. Wait, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with each carbon bonded to three others in a tetrahedral arrangement. So 1 and 3 might be on adjacent carbons or maybe not. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane can undergo elimination between the two Br atoms, but if they're not adjacent, elimination might form a bridge or a ring. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the product is a diene or a single double bond.

Wait, the product after heating with KOH is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR shows a
