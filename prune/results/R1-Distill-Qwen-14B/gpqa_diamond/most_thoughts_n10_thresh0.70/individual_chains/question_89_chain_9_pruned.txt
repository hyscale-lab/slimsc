Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and think about what's happening.

First, the compound is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The ¹H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which looks like a triplet maybe. Then, 2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H, which is probably some sort of adamantane ring protons. And 1.94 ppm for 2H.

So, the first reaction is probably a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. Since it's dibrominated, heating with a strong base like KOH suggests an E2 elimination. Since there are two bromines, maybe two eliminations happen. But wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, perhaps it abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a diene? Or maybe a diketone?

Wait, another possibility: in the presence of a strong base, maybe the compound undergoes a double elimination to form a ketone. If both Brs are eliminated, perhaps forming a carbonyl group. Since the IR shows a carbonyl, that suggests product 1 is an adamantane derivative with ketone groups.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if each Br is on adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination would form a double bond. But that's only if one Br is removed. But with excess KOH, perhaps both are eliminated. Let me think. When two adjacent bromines are present, elimination could form a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the structure is such that the Brs are on opposite faces or adjacent? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the base causes each Br to leave, forming two ketones. Oh wait, that would require that each Br is on a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination. So, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Oh, in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons can undergo certain reactions. But wait, bridgehead carbonyls are generally possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a double elimination to form a diketone. So product 1 is 1,3-diketoadamantane or something similar. The NMR of product 1: the triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H could be from an -OCH₂- group or maybe from an -CH₂- adjacent to carbonyls. Wait, but with KOH, maybe it's forming a diol? No, because the IR shows a carbonyl, not an -OH. So, maybe elimination forms a diketone. Let me think about the NMR peaks. The 4.79 ppm is a triplet. If it's adjacent to a ketone, perhaps it's a CH₂ next to two carbonyls. Like a geminal diol? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's the ketone adjacent to a CH₂ group.

Wait, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl, and the adjacent CH₂ groups. Let me think about the structure. If each Br is on a bridgehead, and KOH removes both, maybe each bridgehead becomes a carbonyl. So, the structure would have two ketone groups, and the adjacent CH₂ groups would be as in the NMR.

Wait, but the NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a region where CH₂ groups adjacent to oxygen or carbonyls appear. So, maybe the two Hs are on a CH₂ connected to a carbonyl group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring Hs. So, perhaps these are the Hs on a CH₂ between two carbonyls. Like, if you have O=C-CH₂-CH₂-C=O, but that might not fit the NMR. Wait, no, because that would be a larger coupling. Alternatively, perhaps each CH₂ is next to a carbonyl, so each H on CH₂ would couple with the adjacent CH₂'s Hs.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is for a CH₂ connected to an oxygen, like an ether. But I don't see an oxygen in the starting material, so probably not. Wait, but KOH is a base; perhaps it's forming an epoxide? No, because the starting material isn't an alkene. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a ketone. The NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let me think about common NMR shifts. A triplet at 4.79 might be a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, the CH₂ groups in acetone are around 2.1 ppm, but that's for CH3 groups. If it's a CH₂ next to a carbonyl, like in an enone system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone, and the 4.79 ppm is from a bridging CH₂ group between two carbonyls. But then, how would the coupling look? Let's say the structure is such that each CH₂ is between two carbonyls. So each H on CH₂ would couple with two Hs on adjacent CH₂ groups. Wait, maybe that's leading to a triplet. Because if each H is next to a CH₂ group with two Hs, each H would split into a triplet.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first step forms cyclohexanone rings. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form diols. But the IR shows a carbonyl, not an -OH. Alternatively, maybe the Br is removed with elimination to form a carbonyl. So each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination gives a carbonyl in each position. So product 1 would be 1,3-dik
