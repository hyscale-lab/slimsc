Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. I guess the neutrino's mass is negligible because neutrinos are super light, like almost massless. So I can probably ignore that.

Wait, right, in particle physics, neutrinos are often considered to have zero rest mass for these kinds of problems, especially when dealing with high-energy particles where their mass is negligible compared to others. So the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is approximately zero.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. So after the decay, the total momentum must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. Or, in other words, they have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions.

Now, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy, right? Because E = gamma * m*c². But wait, the neutrino's energy is purely kinetic since its rest mass is zero. So E = p*c for the neutrino.

Wait, but since energy and momentum are conserved, I can write two equations here. Let me think about that.

So, conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
And conservation of momentum: p_pi = p_mu + p_nu. But p_pi is zero because the pion is at rest. So p_mu = -p_nu, meaning |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote the magnitude of their momenta as p. So p_mu = p, and p_nu = p. But wait, the neutrino's momentum is in the opposite direction, but since I'm considering magnitudes, that's okay.

Wait, no, in vector terms, p_mu is in one direction, p_nu is in the opposite direction, so their vector sum is zero. So, the magnitudes are equal. So yes, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Now, the energies: E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c² )^2 ) / c², but I think in units where c=1, this is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). Similarly, E_nu = p, because for the neutrino, E = p c, and if c=1, E = p.

Wait, but in particle physics, units are often in MeV and MeV/c², so sometimes c is set to 1. Hmm. Let me get the units right. So m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c². So when I write E = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ), that's E in MeV. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2 c^4 ) / c²? Wait, no, probably better to work in units where c=1, so E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ), and E_nu = p.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The energy of a particle is given by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So if I'm working in MeV units, then p is in MeV/c, m is in MeV/c²
