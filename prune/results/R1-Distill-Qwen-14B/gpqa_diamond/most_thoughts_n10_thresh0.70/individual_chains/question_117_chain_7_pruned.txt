Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has something to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Like, when a molecule has chiral centers. Oh wait, chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has that, it can have enantiomers, which are optical isomers.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let me look at each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So biphenyl rings connected at position 1, and with substituents at 2 and 6 positions. I think this structure has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. Now, in biphenyls, the substituents can cause the rings to rotate, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. Wait, so if the substituents are in positions that prevent rotation and create a chiral center around the bond between the rings, then it would have stereoisomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule as a whole is chiral because of the arrangement of the substituents. So 6,6' are nitro groups and 2,2' are carbonyl groups attached to OMe. Hmm, the carbonyl groups are in positions 2 and 2', so each phenyl ring has a COOCH3 group in position 2 and a nitro group in 6. So the structure is like two benzene rings connected at 1 and 1', with substituents at 2 and 6 on each. Do these substituents make the molecule chiral? Well, I think in biphenyls, if the substituents are such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it can have optical isomerism. Wait, in 6,6',2,2' substitution, perhaps the arrangement leads to the molecule being chiral. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think the rings could have different substituents which could lead to a lack of internal planes of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. So maybe this one does show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- but with methyl ester. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the structure where the propanoate has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait, propan
