Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle accelerators, but let's try to think this through. 

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], and we're given Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. We need to find how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, wait. Synchrocyclotrons... aren't they a type of cyclotron that uses a varying magnetic field? Or is it the electric field? Oh right, I think in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particle's momentum increases, which allows the particle to stay in phase with the accelerating electric field. But wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with another type. Another thought: cyclotrons have a fixed magnetic field and use a varying electric field to accelerate the particles each time they complete a semicircle.

But in any case, the problem is about finding the number of revolutions. So I need to figure out how many times the proton goes around the accelerator ring before reaching 950 MeV.

Wait, the problem mentions two accelerations. Hmm, perhaps each time it goes around, it gets a certain amount of energy? Or maybe each acceleration step adds a certain energy. Oh wait, but the voltage is alternating, so maybe the proton is accelerated each time it passes through the electric field region, and each such passage corresponds to a certain number of revolutions.

But wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(θ), where θ = 2πν(α)t + Φ0. So the frequency ν(α) — I'm not sure what α stands for. Maybe the relativistic mass increase? Because in cyclotrons, as the particles gain energy, their mass increases, so the cyclotron frequency changes. Synchrocyclotrons adjust the magnetic field to keep the frequency the same, but maybe in this case, the frequency ν depends on α, which could be the mass ratio or something.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the basic approach. The proton starts with negligible KE, so initial energy is about its rest mass, which is about 938 MeV/c². But since T is 950 MeV, that's a significant fraction, so relativistic effects are important. Hmm, but maybe the problem doesn't require going into heavy relativity.

The kinetic energy gained by the proton is provided by the voltage. Each time the proton passes through the accelerating gap, it gains energy equal to the voltage applied. But wait, in a cyclotron, the particles go through the gaps between the D-shaped electrodes. The voltage alternates, so each time the particle passes through, it's accelerated if the voltage is in the right phase.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particle's momentum increases,
