Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Wait, no, wait, more accurately, I think when nitriles are treated with HCl (or HI) and something like H2O, it's the hydrolysis to give carboxylic acids. But wait, red phosphorus is often involved in something else. Oh right! Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or wait, maybe it's converting nitriles to imidates? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another reaction. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: when nitriles are treated with red phosphorus and HI, they undergo hydrolysis to form aldehydes. Oh wait, no, that's when you have a nitrile without an alpha hydrogen. If the nitrile has alpha hydrogens, maybe it forms a ketone or an amine? Or wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Maybe red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine via the Stephen reduction? No, Stephen reduction uses HCl and PCl5, I think. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the data given for Compound
