Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each reaction carefully.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize this structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. The prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2?) Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C with a double bond, maybe CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, propene is CH2=CH-CH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me get that right. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is the group CH2-C(R)=CH2? Hmm, maybe it's more like CH2-CH(CH2?), no. Wait, the structure is prop-1-en-2-yl: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(CH2?) No, wait, the formula for prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's propane. Oh wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is at position 2, so it's CH2-CH(CH2?), actually, maybe the group is CH2-C(CH2?), but perhaps more accurately, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane ring? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So the structure would
