Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. 

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed. Wait, but how do I approach this? Maybe I should start by figuring out the moles of each acid and base.

So, the data given:

- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely. So moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl.

- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but each molecule gives 2 H+ ions. So the moles here would be 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. But since each mole gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So moles = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2, which means 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but the neutralization reaction between acid and base: H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

So let's calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1 moles (since HCl is 1:1)
Total H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 moles (since H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per mole)
So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

Wait, but which one is in excess? Let's see: if 0.28 H+ reacts with 0.2 OH-, then H+ is in excess by 0.08 moles.

Wait, but no, because OH- is less. So all OH- will react, and some H+ remains.

Wait, no, the neutralization would use up the limiting reagent. So the OH- will be completely neutralized, leaving excess H+.

Wait, but in terms of the enthalpy of neutralization, the usual value is for a strong acid and strong base, 57 kJ/mol (or about -57 kJ per mole of H+ or OH-). So the question here is, how much H+ and OH- are reacting, and how much is in excess.

Wait, but when you have multiple acids and a base, the neutralization would first use the H+ from each acid to react with OH-.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

Calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, the neutralization reaction will proceed until either H+ or OH- is used up.

So, total
