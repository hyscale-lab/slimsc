Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves NMR, bromination, elimination reaction, and then a Diels-Alder reaction maybe? Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I'm thinking about what structures give these signals.

A triplet at around 0.9 ppm is usually from a CH2CH3 group. Because each of those protons is a triplet, it must be adjacent to another CH2 group. Wait, 6H in a triplet—maybe two equivalent CH3 groups. So like (CH2CH3)2 something? And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—could that be a CH2CH2 group next to a CH3? Or perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. So maybe it's a structure where there are two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2.

Wait, maybe it's something like diethyl something. Because diethyl groups have that kind of splitting. Let me think: diethyl ether, for example, has two CH2CH3 groups. The ethyl groups in diethyl ether would have the CH3 as a triplet because they're next to a CH2 which is split into a triplet. The CH2 would be a quartet because each of the two protons in CH2 is next to another CH2. Wait, but for diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. But in the NMR here, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm (CH3) and the quartet at 1.3 (CH2). So diethyl ether's NMR might look like that. But wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. But wait, the NMR would have the CH3 as a triplet (each CH3 is next
