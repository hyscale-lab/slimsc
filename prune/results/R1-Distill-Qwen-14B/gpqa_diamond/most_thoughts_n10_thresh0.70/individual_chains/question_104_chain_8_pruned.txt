Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are roughly the same mass.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. They detected a shift in the spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. The shifts are given: Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the shifts are periodic. Oh, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's orbit. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter.

So, what do these shifts tell us? I think the shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is something like v = (shift) / (wavelength) * c, but I might be getting that mixed up. Alternatively, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, K, which is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us.

Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period? The orbital period is the time it takes for the planet to orbit the star. Oh, right, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Since the orbits are circular, the inclination isn't varying, so I think we can ignore that for this problem.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/1) * (1/(P * (1 - e^2)^(1/2))) ) ), but wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital period and the mass ratio.

Wait, another approach: since the stars are identical (same mass as Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the mass of the planet is much less than the star's mass, so M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet
