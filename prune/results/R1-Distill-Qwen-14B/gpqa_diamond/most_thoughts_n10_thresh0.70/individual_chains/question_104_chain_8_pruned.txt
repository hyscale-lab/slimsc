Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of two planets compare based on the spectral line shifts observed. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup: two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them.

RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and orbit.

Wait, but in this question, they're giving the shift in wavelengthâ€”specifically, the periodic shift. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is what they're showing. K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. But wait, the shift here is given in milangstroms, which I think relates to the Doppler shift formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is delta lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. So the shift in wavelength (delta lambda) is proportional to the velocity. So, a bigger shift means a higher velocity.

So, planet #1 has a 5 milangstrom shift, and planet #2 has a 7. So planet #2's star has a larger velocity amplitude K. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

Wait, but both planets have the same mass as Neptune, so their masses are the same. Since the
