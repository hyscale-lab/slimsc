Okay, so I've got this question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a peptidic compound. Hmm, I need to figure out why there are these extra peaks showing up. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum is mostly what's expected, except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Oh, and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So what could cause two peaks for the same proton without being split by neighboring protons?

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum as expected. So the mass is the same for both, which suggests it's not a different compound like a byproduct or a fragment. If they were different, the mass would vary. So it's the same molecule, but in some form that leads to two peaks.

The options are A) precursor, B) enantiomers, C) double coupling, D) diastereomers.

Let me consider each option. Option A: contamination with a precursor. If that were the case, the mass would be different—the precursor would have a higher mass, right? Because it's the starting material before some reaction. But the LC-MS shows same mass, so A is probably not it.

Option B: mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, and they have the same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. So for NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the protons in each enantiomer would have the same shift because the environment is symmetrical. Wait, but then why two peaks? Oh, because in the NMR, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, the alpha protons might not split into multiple peaks. But wait, no—enantiomers are different in that they can rotate plane of polarization, but in an achiral environment, their NMR peaks would overlap. So if the mixture is enantiomers, the NMR wouldn't see them as separate. Unless the machine is in a chiral environment, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think more.

Option C: double coupling. I'm not too familiar with this term. Oh, wait, during an amide bond forming reaction, sometimes you can have some scrambling of the protons. Or perhaps it's about when a new bond is formed, like in a ring or something. But how would that lead to two peaks for the same proton in NMR? Maybe if there's some coupling with another proton or something else. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin, so it's not about splitting due to neighboring protons. So I'm not sure about option C.

Option D: mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties, including NMR shifts. So if the compound exists as a mix of diastereomers, the alpha protons could be in different environments, leading to different chemical shifts. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So in diastereomers, maybe the shifts are close but not the same. Also, if the mixture is a diastereomeric pair, the NMR would show two sets of peaks. But in this case, the integral adds to 1H, which suggests that each peak is integrating to about 0.5H, so two different environments each with 0.5H. Hmm, possible.

But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So each peak is 0.5H. That could happen if the proton is in two different environments. How? Maybe if the molecule is in a dynamic process, but that's usually seen as a single peak with a certain shift if there's interconversion, unless the interconversion is slow on the NMR timescale.

Wait, but the two peaks have similar
