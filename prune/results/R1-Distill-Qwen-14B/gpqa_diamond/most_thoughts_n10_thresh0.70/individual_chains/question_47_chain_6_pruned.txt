Okay, so I've got this problem to figure out. It's about identifying an organic compound based on spectral data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. Wait, no, wait, the formula is C9H11NO2, so X (halogens) are 0. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 3) and maybe a double bond or ring plus some substituents.

Looking at the IR data: strong absorption at 1720 cm-1. That suggests a carbonyl group. The bands around 3420 and 3325 are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or amine. So maybe the compound has an amide group or something with N-H bonds.

Then the 1H NMR data:
1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That looks like a methyl group adjacent to something, maybe an ethyl group. Like CH2CH3, so a triplet because the neighboring CH2 has two protons. So maybe ethyl something.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could be adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 or NCH2. Wait, but if it's a singlet and broad, perhaps it's NH2, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Or maybe an OCH2 group as part of an ester or ether.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 connected to another CH2. Like if it's an ester group, the OCH2 might be next to another CH2. For example, in an ethyl ester, the CH2CH3 would be around 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3. Wait, but here it's 4.5. Hmm, maybe it's another scenario. Alternatively, maybe a methylene next to an oxygen and another group.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm, doublet (2H); 8.0 ppm, doublet (2H). That's a symmetrical pattern, probably para-substituted on a benzene ring. Each doublet indicates coupling with one neighboring proton. So if it's a para substitution, each pair of protons is adjacent, so the doublets might be from two sets of protons next to substituents.

Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with
