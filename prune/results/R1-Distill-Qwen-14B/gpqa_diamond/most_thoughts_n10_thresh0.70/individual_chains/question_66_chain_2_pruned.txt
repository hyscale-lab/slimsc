Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators, usually written as a series expansion. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations of these. Let's think about each symmetry one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I think SMEFT, like the Standard Model, is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Operators in SMEFT should transform properly under the Lorentz group. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, but wait, effective field theories usually assume Poincare invariance because they're built from local interactions. So Poincare symmetry must be respected. So 1 and 2 would both be correct.

3. CP symmetry: Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in some cases, like in the CKM matrix where CP violation occurs. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT shouldn't enforce it either. So operators in SMEFT could violate CP. So CP symmetry isn't necessarily respected by all operators.

4. CPT symmetry: I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that are Lorentz-invariant must respect CPT symmetry. Because of the way the symmetries are connected. So even if a theory doesn't respect C, P, or T individually, the combination CPT must hold. So SMEFT, being Lorentz-invariant, must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So looking at the options:

Which of these must all operators respect? 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must be respected. Wait, but wait: no, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. So which symmetries must all operators respect?

Wait, the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So which symmetries are enforced in the SMEFT framework.

In SMEFT, all operators must be Lorentz-invariant because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. Poincare symmetry is also a part of that because it includes translations, which are part of
