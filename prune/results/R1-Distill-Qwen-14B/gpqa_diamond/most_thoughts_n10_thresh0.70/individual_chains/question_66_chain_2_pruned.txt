Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are A, B, C, D combinations.

First, I need to remember what each symmetry entails. Lorentz symmetry involves the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which are the transformations between different inertial frames. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations in space and time. So Poincare is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz.

Wait, so if an operator respects Poincare symmetry, does it automatically respect Lorentz symmetry? Because Poincare includes it. So if the question is which symmetries must be respected, then I need to see if all SMEFT operators must adhere to these.

I think SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Effective theories usually incorporate the symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT, being an effective theory of it, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare?

Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because effective theories can include terms that break certain symmetries, but I think the SMEFT framework is built to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz and Poincare. So operators in SMEFT would have to respect these.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry might involve more than just the physics of the theory. Like, the theory's action must be invariant under Poincare transformations. SMEFT is formulated with operators constructed from Standard Model fields, so their terms should be consistent with the Poincare symmetry.

So I think both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are respected. Then, looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, which are Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, am I sure? Because sometimes the effective theory might include higher-dimensional operators that could potentially violate certain symmetries, but no, I think not. Because the SMEFT is constructed in a way that all operators are consistent with the Standard Model symmetries, which include
