Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says we've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3. They didn't find any particles outside this range.

Wait, so the wave function is given as this expression. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function usually has to satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

So the wave function must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. But wait, in this case, the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. Because when they measured, particles were only found there. Does that mean the wave function is zero outside this interval? Or is the wave function given as defined only in this region?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but the problem states that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside that interval? That would make the particle's position confined between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function provided is a specific form. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the way the problem is phrased is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

The wave function in a part of space where it can exist is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that part is where the particle can be found, which is x between 1 and 3.

Wait, but that seems a bit conflicting. Because if the wave function is non-zero only in that region, then the integral from 1 to 3 of |Î¨|^2 dx should be 1. So we can use that to find 'a'.

Because the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and assuming
