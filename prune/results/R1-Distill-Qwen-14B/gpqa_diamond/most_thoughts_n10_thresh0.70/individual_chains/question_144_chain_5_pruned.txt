Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. 

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I guess it's about how far the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. The formula I think is something like distance L = v * τ, where v is the velocity and τ is the mean lifetime. So I need to find τ first.

But how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the total decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, isn't Γ the total decay width? So yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but I should double-check the units. Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. And ħ has units of GeV·s (since Planck's constant has units of J·s, and 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, but I think ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s). So I can use that value.

So first, let me calculate τ. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that seems really short. But particles with short lifetimes decay quickly, so that makes sense.

Next, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. Since it's produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its mass is m_X =1.2 GeV. Wait, because in particle physics, energies are often given in units where c=1, so the energy E is related to mass and momentum by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since c is
