Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D, with various distances in meters.

Hmm, right. I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The formula probably involves the lifetime (tau), and maybe the speed of the particle or something like that. Oh wait, the mean path length is usually given by gamma * c * tau, right?

Wait, let me think. The mean lifetime (tau) is the average time a particle exists before decaying. But when a particle is moving at relativistic speeds, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Gamma factor comes into play here.

So, the mean decay distance L should be the speed v multiplied by the lifetime tau. But since the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can approximate v ≈ c for a rough calculation. So L ≈ c * gamma * tau.

Wait, wait. Gamma is the Lorentz factor. So gamma equals E / (m c²). Or wait, E is the total energy, which for a relativistic particle includes kinetic energy plus rest mass energy.

Wait, the production energy is given as 8 GeV. Is that the total energy? Because in particle physics, often E is the total energy. So E_X is the total energy, which is gamma * m_X c².

So gamma would be E_X / (m_X c²). Let me write that down.

Gamma (γ) = E_X / (m_X c²)

Wait, but m_X is given in GeV, and E_X is 8 GeV. So let's compute that.

Wait, but units: m_X is 1.2 GeV. So m_X c² would be 1.2 GeV. So E_X is 8 GeV.

So gamma (γ) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

Wait, but I'm not sure if E_X is the total energy. In some cases, E could be the kinetic energy, but I think in this context, since it's production energy, it's the total energy. So I'll proceed with that.

Next, the lifetime tau. I remember that the lifetime is related to the width Γ. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is approximately hbar. So Γ ≈ ħ / tau. Therefore, tau ≈
