Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

In this case, when the star doesn't have spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. But wait, I think the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Oh right, starspots are darker and cooler regions. So the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower when spots are present. But how does that affect the photospheric conditions where the Ti atoms are?

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the question is considering the photosphere as a whole, so the temperature used in the Boltzmann factor is 5500 K when there are spots, and 6000 K when there aren't. That makes sense because the observed Teff is lower when spots cover part of the surface.

So the ratio when there are no spots (R_no_spots) is calculated at 6000 K, and when there are spots (R_spots) at 5500 K. The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So I need to compute R_no_spots / R_spots.

Wait, but the ratio observed is decreasing when the star has spots. So R_no_spots is higher than R_spots, and the factor is R_no_spots divided by R_spots. So the factor will be greater than 1.

Now, the transition is at about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. The energy difference between
