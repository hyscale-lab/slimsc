Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about SARS-CoV-2 is incorrect. I'll take each option one by one and think through what I know.

Option A: It says that nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN work as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. I remember that nsp14 has an ExoN domain and that nsp10 is a cofactor for some exonucleases. Wait, actually, I think they form a complex that's involved in RNA proofreading. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Mismatch repair in viruses? Or maybe it's more about RNA editing. I think some coronaviruses have an error correction mechanism. For SARS-CoV-2, I believe nsp14-ExoN with nsp10 is an endonuclease. Oh wait, but the statement says it prevents breakdown of dsRNA. Hmm, maybe that's incorrect because I thought the ExoN activity might degrade RNA, not prevent its breakdown. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the functions. I'll need to think more about this.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation, which is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Bcl-2 is involved in the intrinsic pathway, mitochondrial stuff. The statement says that ORF3a doesn't affect Bcl-2 levels. So if caspase-8 is activated extrinsically, but Bcl-2 isn't involved, that suggests the virus is mainly using the extrinsic pathway. I remember that SARS-CoV-2 can cause apoptosis, but I think ORF3a might actually promote both pathways. Wait, no, some studies suggest that ORF3a can activate caspase-8 directly, which would be extrinsic, but sometimes it can also cause mitochondrial damage. Hmm, but the option says that Bcl-2 expression isn't affected, so perhaps the intrinsic pathway isn't being used. I'm not sure if this statement is correct or not. I'll come back to this.

Option C: Frameshifting rate correlates with pseudoknot conformations. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have two conformations under tension. I remember that frameshifting is a way for the virus to produce different proteins. The programmed -1 frameshift uses a slippery sequence and a pseudoknot.
