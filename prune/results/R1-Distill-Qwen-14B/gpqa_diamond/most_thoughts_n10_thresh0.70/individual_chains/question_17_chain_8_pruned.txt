Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and formation constants? EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions in a 1:1 ratio. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So in this case, the complex is Ca-EDTA, and Kf is 5e10.

The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. The Kf is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M. Since the formation is 1:1, I think the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But considering the Kf is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²+) should be very low. Because Kf is big, the reaction favors the formation of the complex, meaning the dissociation is minimal.

So the problem boils down to calculating [Ca²+] when the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, given Kf.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the complex. Let's assume that the complex is at equilibrium with the metal ion and the ligand. So the reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex (CaEDTA²-) is 0.02 M, but wait, no: the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. If we consider that the complex dissociates a little, but given that K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca²+] would be very small.

Wait, but perhaps we can assume that the complex doesn't dissoci
