Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: A charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with potentials and charges around conductors, image charges come into play. Oh right, the method of images. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so does that affect the image charge approach?

So, a grounded conductor implies that the sphere is at zero potential. Oh wait, because it's connected to the ground, which is at Earth's potential, which we take as zero. So any charges induced on the sphere would adjust to maintain that potential.

When a charge q is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute. For a non接地 (not grounded) conducting sphere, you'd use image charges. But since it's grounded, the sphere can't accumulate any net charge—it must remain neutral. So any induced charges would exactly cancel the image charge, right?

Wait, let me think. The image charge method is used when the conductor is isolated. If the conductor is grounded, the charges can flow in or out, so the image charge idea might not directly apply. Hmm.

Another approach: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position d away from the sphere
