Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is: we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this diluted solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

First step: I should figure out the concentrations after dilution. We're mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Wait, no, wait, when you mix two solutions, the total volume changes. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because the volume doubles.

So the initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume (in liters). That's 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Diluting with 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Okay, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a minute, no, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So yes, total volume is 40 cm³, hence 0.04 L. So the dilution factor is 2, so concentration halves. Got it.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the first part is to find the pH at 25% titration, which would mean 25% of the equivalence point volume. The second part is the pH at equivalence point.

I should first calculate the equivalence point. To find that, I need the volume of NaOH needed to neutralize all the acetic acid.

The reaction is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH. So moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added. But the first part is 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, so at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. Let's think about how much of the acetic acid has reacted.

The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, this means 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate ions.

So initially, we had 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH, which is 0.00025 moles, the moles remaining would be 0.0
