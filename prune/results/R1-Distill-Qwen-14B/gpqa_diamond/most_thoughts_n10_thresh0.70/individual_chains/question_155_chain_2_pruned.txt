Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state vector is given, and I need to calculate the uncertainty.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator itself. So the formula for ΔP_z should be sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but wait. Since the operator P_z is given, and the state is given, I need to compute these expectation values.

The state is given as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. Let me write that as |ψ⟩ = [ a, b, c ]^T where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

The operator P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ]. So its matrix form is:

[ ħ   0    0  ]
[ 0   0    0  ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis is the standard eigenbasis for P_z, which means the matrix is diagonal in this basis. So each diagonal element corresponds to the eigenvalue of P_z for that basis vector.

So, for each basis state |e_i⟩, P_z |e_i⟩ = p_i |e_i⟩, where p_i is the eigenvalue.

So the first basis vector has eigenvalue ħ, the second 0, and the third -ħ.

But in this problem, the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. So each component in the vector represents the amplitude for that eigenstate.

So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. Since the state is |ψ⟩, ⟨P_z⟩ is given by ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this is just the sum of the components of ψ multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, let's think about it. The expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 * p_i, where c_i are the components of |ψ⟩ and p_i are the eigenvalues of P_z for each basis vector.

So the components are a = -1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2.

But wait, wait, because the state is given as a column vector, the first component is a, so that's the amplitude for the first eigenstate (eigenvalue ħ), the second component b is the amplitude for the second eigenstate (0), and the third component c is the amplitude for the third eigenstate (-ħ).
