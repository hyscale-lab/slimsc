Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about quantum mechanics, specifically involving state vectors and observable operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem states that the system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think that means the state vector is a 3x1 matrix, so it's a three-dimensional vector. Let me write that down: the state vector |ψ> is [-1; 2; 1].

The observable is represented by matrix P. The elements of P are given. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So, matrix P looks like this:

P = [
    [0, 1/√2, 0],
    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
    [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, but observables are Hermitian operators, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes. I should check if P is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of P should be equal to P. But looking at the elements, since all the non-diagonal elements are real, their transposes will just swap the off-diagonal elements. Let me see:

The (1,2) element is 1/√2. The (2,1) is also 1/√2. The (2,3) is 1/√2, and (3,2) is 1/√2. The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So, yes, P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. That makes sense.

Now, the question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. I remember that the possible outcomes of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I probably need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are 0.

Wait, but I think another approach is that the expectation value of P is calculated as <ψ| P |ψ>. But wait, the expectation value is the average outcome, but the probability of a specific outcome is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, but in this case, maybe 0 is an eigenvalue of P, so the probability is the square of the component of |ψ> in the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So first, I should find the eigenvalues of P. 

Let me try to compute the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix (P - λ I) is:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

The determinant of this 3x3 matrix should be zero.

Calculating the determinant:

I think the determinant can be expanded as:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look for patterns or symmetries. Because the matrix P looks symmetric and perhaps has a specific structure, maybe there's a way to find the eigenvalues without expanding the determinant completely.

Wait, another thought: the sum of the rows of P might give some insight. Let's check each row:

First row: 0
