Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum energy of this system of charges. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Since electrons have a charge of e, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs, each of these must be 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, no, wait. Electron charge is e = 1.6 Ã— 10^-19 C. So 2e would be 2 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-19 C. Right.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So I guess point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed.

Wait, but how are they arranged? Are the 12 charges all at the same point at 2 m from P, or are they placed in some configuration like a sphere or something? Oh, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m centered at P. But since we're talking about electrostatic energy, the exact arrangement could matter, but perhaps for the minimum energy, the charges are placed in a way that minimizes repulsion. Oh wait, but all the charges are the same sign, right? Because they're 2e each. So 2e is positive if e is positive. So all 13 charges are positive, since each is 2e. So same sign, so they repel each other.

Wait, but point P has the 13th charge fixed there, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is 2 m away from P, which is where the 13th charge is.

So the system's potential energy comes from the interactions between all pairs of charges. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But calculating all possible pairs might be a bit involved. Let me think about how to compute the total potential energy
