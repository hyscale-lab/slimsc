Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through this carefully. The question is about identifying an unknown compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. 

The NMR data provided is:
1H NMR (ppm): 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but let me try to break this down. First, I should probably figure out the structure of each option to see which one fits the given spectrum.

So, all these compounds are esters. Acetate esters have the general structure R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, wait. Acetate is an ester where the acyl part is from acetic acid. So the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Let me get this right. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. So the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, I think the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. Because the ester is formed from the acid and the alcohol. So the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, I get confused. Let me think: the general ester structure is R-O-CO-R'. So in acetate esters, the R' is methyl (from acetic acid), so it's R-O-CO-CH3.

So the four options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. Let me think about the structures.

First, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- group. But wait, propenyl has a double bond. So propenyl can be either cis or trans, but wait, for a propenyl group, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So propenyl could be allyl group, like CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond.

Wait, but wait. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. But in the case of propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the ester is formed by the alcohol (propenyl alcohol?) reacting with acetic acid. So if the alcohol is CH2=CHCH2-OH, then the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but wait, propenyl can be more accurately described as CH2=CHCH2-O-. But for the structure, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-.

Now, considering the cis and trans versions. Wait, propenyl is a three-carbon group with a double bond. So the substituents on either side can be in cis or trans arrangement. But wait, for
