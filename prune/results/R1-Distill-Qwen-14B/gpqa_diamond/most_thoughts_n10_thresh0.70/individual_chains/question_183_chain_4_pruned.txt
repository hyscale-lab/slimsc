Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a specific reaction. Let me try to break it down.

First, the compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize its structure. It's a cyclohexene ring, right? So cyclohexene means there's a double bond somewhere in the ring.

The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (that's a CHO group). And at position 5, a vinyl group, which is CH2CH2 but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the structure is cyclohexene with a formyl at C2 and a vinyl (maybe as a substituent) at C5. Oh wait, cyclohex-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, I think. So the ring has a double bond, making it a cyclohexene.

So the molecule is a substituted cyclohexene with a formyl group and a vinyl group attached. Let me sketch this mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, C2 has a formyl (CHO), and C5 has a vinyl group (CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–, so it's attached to the ring as a substituent. So position 5 has a vinyl group, which is another double bond.

Wait, so the structure has two double bonds: one in the ring (cyclohexene) and another in the vinyl group. So the starting molecule has two double bonds. Also, the carboxylic acid group is present, but that's a substituent as well.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus and HI... Oh, wait, that's the reaction for hydrohalogenation, but more specifically, it's the addition of halogen across double bonds, maybe? Or wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the hydroboration reaction, but wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, that's for ketones. Wait, no, another thought: Maybe it's for the halogenation of alkenes. Alternatively, HI with red phosphorus is used for the addition to alkenes, breaking the double bonds.

Oh, wait, I think the reaction is the hydration of alkenes, but no. Alternatively, the HI is acting as a halogen source for addition across double bonds. Red phosphorus is sometimes used as a catalyst for such reactions, perhaps. Or wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation scenario? No, perhaps the reaction is more about adding HI across double bonds.

Wait, wait. Another thought: The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is the method for the addition of iodine to double bonds. Because I remember that in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can add across double
