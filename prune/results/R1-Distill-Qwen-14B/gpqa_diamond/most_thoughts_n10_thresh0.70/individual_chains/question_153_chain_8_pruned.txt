Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think this through.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, in this case, the nucleophile is the enolate from one of the reactants.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), it deprotonates to form the enolate. The enolate has a negative charge on the alpha carbon, which can attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. The acrylate group is CH2=CHCO2Me, but the substituent is at the 3-position, which means the structure is CH2-CH-CO2Me, but with a p-tolyl group (a methyl group attached to a benzene ring) on the middle carbon. Wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-CO2Me, but the substituent is on the middle carbon. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me? Wait, no, the (E) configuration would imply that the substituents are opposite each other. But the position is 3, so perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO2Me, but in the (E) configuration.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCO2R. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-O2Me? No, wait: the numbering is from the carbonyl. So, the carbonyl is at position 1, then position 2 is the alpha carbon, position 3 is the beta. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O2Me? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the structure could be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me, but in the (E) configuration, meaning that the p-tolyl and the CO2Me are on opposite sides. Wait, but where exactly
