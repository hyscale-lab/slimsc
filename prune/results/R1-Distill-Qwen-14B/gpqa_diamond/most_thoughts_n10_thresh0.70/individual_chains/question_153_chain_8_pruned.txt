Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Oh right, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. 

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out the products for each. Then match them with the options A, B, C given.

Let's take the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. So, in such conditions, the base would deprotonate the alpha position of the carbonyl compounds to form enolates. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can act as a nucleophile. The other compound is the acceptor. So, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the double bond is between C3 and C2, with a p-tolyl group on C3. The malonate enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. 

When the enolate attacks, the p-tolyl group is at the beta position. So, the attack would add the malonate's R groups onto that carbon. Wait, the structure might look something like CH2-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl group. The malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. So when the enolate of the malonate attacks the acrylate, it would add across the double bond. 

So, the product would have the malonate groups attached to the acrylate. The product would be a trimethyl something tricarboxylate. Let me think: after the addition, the structure would be something like the p-tolyl group attached to a carbon that's connected to two other carbons, each with two COOEt groups. Wait, no, perhaps it's more like the acrylate becomes a longer chain with the malonate added.

Alternatively, the malonate has two CH2COOEt groups. When it attacks the acrylate, the new structure would have the p-tolyl group and the two malonate groups in a row. So maybe the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That makes sense because the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but wait, no, the acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. No, wait, wait. Let me clarify. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-p-tolyl connected to the ester. So, the formula is CH2=CH-p-tolyl-O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2? Or wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So, if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl-CO-OEt? Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2, but that doesn't make sense because acrylate is a propenoate. So, the correct structure is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOEt? Or perhaps the p-tolyl is on the double bond. So, the structure is CH2=C-(p-tolyl)COOEt. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-methyl 3
