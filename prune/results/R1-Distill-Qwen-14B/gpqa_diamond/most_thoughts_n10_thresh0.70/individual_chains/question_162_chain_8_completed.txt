Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that metrics in general relativity describe the geometry of spacetime, and for calculating areas, I probably need to look at the spatial part.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I think the metric might be in conformal form, which makes things easier because the area can be calculated using a simple formula.

In conformal metrics, the line element is usually something like ds² = E² (dx² + dy²), where E is a function. Here, the E² term would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So E squared is 32/(4 - x² - y²), which means E is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

But wait, the area in 2D for a conformal metric is the integral over the surface of E² d²x. Or is it E squared times the area element? Let me think. Oh right, for a 2D metric in conformal form, the area element is E² dx dy. So the total area would be the double integral over some region of E² dx dy.

But what is the region we're integrating over? The metric's denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So that suggests that 4 - x² - y² must be positive to have a real metric. So x² + y² < 4, which means we're looking at a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Oh because 4 is (2)^2. So the domain is the disk with radius 2.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a surface, so maybe in the context of this metric, it's a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some space. Or perhaps this metric describes the geometry of a pseudosphere. Either way, the area would be the integral of the area element over the entire space allowed by the metric.

So the area A is the integral over x and y where x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me set up the integral. Since the domain is a circle, using polar coordinates makes sense. Let me switch to r and θ. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the area integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Because 4 - x² - y² = 4 - r².

Let me factor out the constants. The integral over θ is simple: it's 2π. So,

A = 2π ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Now, let's compute the radial integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

Wait, when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = -32 ∫ (1/u) (du/2) ) [because r dr is -du/2]

So that's (-32 * 1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (-16) ∫ (1/u) du.

But wait, the limits change. When r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ (u=4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) / u ]

Wait, maybe I should be careful with substitution. Let me try again.

∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ]

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2

So,

32 ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ ( -du/2 ) / u = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

The integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so we have:

-16 [ ln(u) ] evaluated from u=4 to u=0.

Wait, u=0 is a problem because ln(0) is negative infinity. Hmm. So when the upper limit is r=2, u=0. That makes this integral go from u=4 down to u=0.

So plugging in:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] → -16 * (-infty) → positive infinity.

Wait wait, wait. So the integral is from u=4 to u=0, and the substitution gives us:

Integral = -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

But ln(0) is -infty, so the expression becomes -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ] = -16 ( -infty - something_finite ) = -16 * (-infty) ) which is positive infinity.

But wait, if the radial integral goes to infinity, then the area A would be 2π multiplied by this, which is also infinity.

But wait, the options include D) +infty. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because a pseudosphere has finite area. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and it's a finite area? Or is it infinite?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, is an infinite surface, right? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the tractrix is a curve, and the pseudosphere is the surface of revolution of the tractrix. But in geometry, the pseudosphere has finite area and finite volume? Or is it different?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the metric. The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator goes to zero as r approaches 2, which is the boundary of the disk. So the curvature is singular at r=2. So the integral over the area up to r=2 would be infinite, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is for a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a finite area surface? Or is it an infinite surface?

Wait, wait, perhaps the metric is actually for the hyperbolic plane. Because in 2D, hyperbolic geometry can be represented with a conformal metric. So if the metric is for the hyperbolic plane, then the area would be infinite, because the hyperbolic plane extends infinitely.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, perhaps the metric is for a pseudosphere, which is a finite area surface. But then, why is the integral giving infinity?

Hmm, so I must be making a mistake in the setup. Maybe the metric is not covering the entire pseudosphere, but something else. Or perhaps the question is about the area of the 2-sphere, but it's a pseudosphere, which might have different properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is a two-dimensional one embedded in some spacetime, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the area is not about the x-y plane, but the actual surface. If this is a 2D surface, the area would be the integral of the area element over the surface.

Wait, another approach: The area of a surface with metric ds² = E²(dx² + dy²) is the integral of E² dx dy. So in this case, E² is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the area is ∫∫ (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But integrating that over the domain x² + y² <4, as I did before, leads to an infinite area. So the answer would be D) infinite.

But wait, the options don't have D as +infty. Wait, yes they do. Option D is +infty. So that would be the answer.

But wait, why is the area infinite? Because as you approach the edge at r=2, the metric blows up, so the area element becomes infinite near the boundary.

So the area would be infinite. So the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a conformal metric, where the spatial part is proportional to \(dx^2 + dy^2\), with the conformal factor \(E^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). The area of a surface with a conformal metric is given by:

\[
A = \int \int E^2 \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is determined by the condition that the metric is well-defined, which requires \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\). This corresponds to the disk \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), or \(r < 2\) in polar coordinates. Converting to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes \(r \, dr \, d\theta\). Thus, the area integral is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants, the integral simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the limits of integration change from \(r = 0\) (\(u = 4\)) to \(r = 2\) (\(u = 0\)). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_4^0.
\]

Evaluating this, \(\ln(u)\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\), leading to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \left(-\infty - \ln(4)\right) = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the total area \(A = 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty\). The singularity at \(r = 2\) causes the area element to diverge, resulting in an infinite total area.

The correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
