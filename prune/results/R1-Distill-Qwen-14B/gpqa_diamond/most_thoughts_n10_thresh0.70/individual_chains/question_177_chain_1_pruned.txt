Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my black body radiation, but I'll think it through.

So, the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Both radius and mass are 1.5 times bigger. Wait, but wait, the question is about luminosity. I remember that luminosity is related to radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power, right? So L = 4πσR²T⁴, but since we're dealing with ratios, the constants like 4πσ will cancel out.

They also say that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. I think Wien's law is relevant here. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, T is the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So, radial velocity is the speed at which they're moving towards or away from us. But wait, does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh wait, that's the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength is affected by their velocities.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So perhaps they are referring to the rest wavelengths, not the observed ones. Or maybe they are talking about the observed wavelengths. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. And that they are the same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us (since radial velocity is 700 km/s, I think positive velocity is moving away, so Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s away, or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the direction. Let me think: if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, so observed λ is shorter. If it's moving away, redshifted, longer λ.

But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So their rest λ_max might be different, but due to their velocities, they appear the same.

Wait, but the problem also says that the stars' luminosities are computed based on black body radiation
