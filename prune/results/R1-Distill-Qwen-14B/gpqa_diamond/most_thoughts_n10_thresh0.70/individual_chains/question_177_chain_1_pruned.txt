Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it through and understand what's being asked. 

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is related to its temperature via Wien's law. So, if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because Wien's law says lambda_max is proportional to 1/T.

Next, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. I'm not sure how radial velocity affects this problem, but since luminosity is being compared, maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting the observed brightness? Hmm, but luminosity is an intrinsic property, not the observed flux. Wait, but perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength, but since the peak wavelengths are the same after considering radial velocity? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the main factors influencing luminosity.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars are black bodies, this should apply. So, the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem
