Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures. There's constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Oh right, stereoisomers can be further divided into enantiomers and diastereomers, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The problem is asking about two parts: part A and part B. Let's break them down.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism. So I need to figure out which of these compounds can't undergo tautomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in the shifting of a double bond. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds or in compounds where a proton is attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups, right? Wait, no. Benzoquinone has two oxygen atoms, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure. Oh wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So for example, it's a six-membered ring with two ketone (O) groups. Let me visualize it: the ring has two O's in positions that are meta, I think. Or maybe para? Wait, benzoquinone can be para or ortho. No, wait, para would be 1,4; but benzoquinone is actually 1,4? Or is that something else. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, benzoquinone is the di- form, with two ketone groups on the benzene ring. So like, each oxygen is in a position where it's attached to the ring as a carbonyl group.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So the structure is like O=C-O-C-O-C-O, but wait no, that's not right. No, it's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So it's
