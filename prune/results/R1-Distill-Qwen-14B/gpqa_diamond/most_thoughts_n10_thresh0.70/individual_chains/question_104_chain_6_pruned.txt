Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the key here is probably relating the Doppler shift to the orbital period of the planet.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the velocity. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes 7. But how does that relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period of the planet, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh wait, since both planets are detected, and the stars have the same mass, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. 

The formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) is given by some equation. Let me think. I think K is proportional to (M_planet * P) / (M_star^(1/3)) or something like that? Or wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ] * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

But since both planets have similar masses and the stars are the same, and assuming the orbits are inclined similarly (i.e., sin i is similar, maybe even the same), then the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3), because when you invert it, K is proportional to (P)^(-1/3).

Wait, let me get the exact formula right. Another way: The formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * ( (1) / (c * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( sin i / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Another approach: Since the stars have the same mass and the planets are similar, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

But given that M_p is much smaller than M_star (since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), the term (M_p/M_star) is negligible. So M_star is roughly similar, so 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So the formula simplifies to K ≈ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) ) * (something else? Wait,
