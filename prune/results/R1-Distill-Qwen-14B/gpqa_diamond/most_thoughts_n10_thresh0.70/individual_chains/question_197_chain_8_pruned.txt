Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully. So, Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The data given are IR and 1H NMR.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, suggesting possible O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, the other peaks are 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 peak is strong and usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or acid. The 1610 and 1450 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. Could that be an aldehyde proton? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton? Or maybe an acidic proton like in a phenol. But wait, the IR doesn't show a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000 with a broad peak, which is typical for carboxylic acids or alcohols. Wait, the IR shows 3400–2500 cm-1, which could be an O-H stretch, but maybe it's a broad peak. So that could be a carboxylic acid. So the 10.5 ppm peak would be the -COOH proton.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the -COOH proton is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So that fits. Then, the IR at 1720 could be the carbonyl of the acid. But let me check the other regions. The aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene. Because the two doublets each of 2H
