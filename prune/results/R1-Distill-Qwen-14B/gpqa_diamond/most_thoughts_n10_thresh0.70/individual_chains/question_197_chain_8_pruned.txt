Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I have to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. I'll need to figure out what Compound X is first and then determine the reaction outcome.

First, let's look at the spectral data given: IR and 1H NMR.

Starting with the IR data:

- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad range suggests the presence of either O-H (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or N-H stretch. But since there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. O-H in carboxylic acids usually shows up as a broad peak around 2500-3300. Alternatively, if the compound is an ester or ketone, the O-H wouldn't be present. Wait, another peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1—those could be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound is an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid derivative.

Now, looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 likely corresponds to an -OH proton. Since it's broad and singlet, it's probably a carboxylic acid. Because aromatic protons usually don't go that high unless it's something like an aldehyde, but the integration is 1H, so maybe a phenolic -OH? But wait, phenols typically are around 5 ppm, but that's for the aromatic protons. Wait, the -OH in phenols usually is a broad peak around 5-7 ppm, but maybe if it's exchange broadened, it might be upfield. Alternatively, this could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde is a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But we have 10.5, which is a bit higher. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would usually be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid.

Then we have:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet with 2H suggests two equivalent aromatic protons. So if it's para-substituted, like two protons on either side. So maybe a para-substituted benzene, where the two protons on one side are equivalent. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet with 2H. So maybe two protons adjacent or in another position. Since it's a doublet, perhaps the coupling is between these two and the other two in the 8.0 ppm. So a typical para-substituted benzene with two substituents—like in a 4-substituted benzene.

Wait, but the integration is 2H each. So in total
