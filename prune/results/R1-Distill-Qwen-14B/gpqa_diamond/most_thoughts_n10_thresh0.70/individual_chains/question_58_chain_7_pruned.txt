Okay, I've got this question here about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So the options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Regularization usually refers to a process in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Like when calculations lead to infinities, you need to regularize them to make the results finite and meaningful. But wait, not all theories might need that, especially if they're free from such divergences.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. I remember that QED has issues with renormalization because of loop divergences. So it definitely requires regularization techniques, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So option C would need regularization, so it's not the answer.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory, and I think it has similar issues with divergences. Plus, it's non-Abelian, so maybe it's more complicated, but regardless, it must require regularization. So option B is probably out.

Superstring Theory is a theory of everything that tries to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Wait, string theory is a different approach. It doesn't use point particles but strings, and it's a background-dependent theory. Oh, but does it avoid needing regularization? Or does it still have the same issues as other quantum field theories? I'm not too sure. I think string theory might have its own ways of handling things, but I'm not certain whether it requires regularization. Alternatively, perhaps it deals with high energies differently. Hmm.

Now, Classical Electrodynamics (option D). That's the Maxwell's equations, right? It's a classical theory, so it doesn't involve the quantum aspects that lead to divergences. Since it's classical, there's no need for regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So in classical ED, you don't deal with divergent integrals the same way because you're not quantizing the fields. Oh wait, but wait, in classical EM, there are issues with self-energy and radiation reaction, like the problem of the electron's self-force leading to the idea of radiation damping. But those are handled in a different way, perhaps through the use of the Larmor formula, or more accurately
