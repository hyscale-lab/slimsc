Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember something about excitation levels and the Boltzmann equation from my studies. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. Excitation level probably refers to the number of atoms in an excited state, right?

And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, because the energy levels of atoms are quantized. So we're dealing with the Boltzmann distribution here, which relates the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.

In the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, n2 is the number of atoms in the higher energy level, n1 in the lower. So n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E2 - E1).

In this problem, the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so that's where the Boltzmann equation applies.

So, star_1 has twice as excited, meaning n1 (star_1) is twice n2 (star_2)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me clarify. Let me denote n1 as the number of excited atoms in star_1, and n2 in star_2. The problem states that n1 is twice n2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the populations within each star. Wait, no, the question is comparing the same energy level between the two stars. So for each star, the population of the excited state compared to the ground state (or another lower state) would depend on their respective temperatures.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the ratio of
