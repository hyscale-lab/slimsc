Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. I remember that luminosity relates to how much light a star emits, and it's connected to other properties like radius and temperature. 

So, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but mass doesn't directly affect luminosity in the same way as radius and temperature, right? I think for black bodies, luminosity depends on radius squared and the fourth power of temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Remember Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. 

Wait, but wait. If their temperatures are the same, then how does that affect their luminosities? Let's think. Luminosity for each star would be L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since T is the same, L is proportional to R². So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Does that mean the answer is A) ~2.25? But wait, let's make sure I didn't miss anything else.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength via the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength of its light shifts. So the observed wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Hmm, does that mean their observed λ_max is the same, or their intrinsic λ_max is the
