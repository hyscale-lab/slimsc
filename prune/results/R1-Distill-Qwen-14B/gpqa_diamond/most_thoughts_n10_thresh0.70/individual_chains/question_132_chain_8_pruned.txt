Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their 1H NMR spectra. The solution is a 1:1 mixture of two compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula. C10H14. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated. For a benzene ring, which is 3 degrees (since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds), plus the substituents.

Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So each molecule has four degrees of unsaturation. Which makes sense because a benzene ring has three, so the fourth is probably a ring or a double bond. But wait, benzene is already a ring, so substituents with rings or double bonds? Or maybe the substituents are just single bonds, but maybe another ring. Hmm, but the molecular formula is C10H14, which is two rings or one ring and one double bond. Oh wait, each benzene ring is three degrees, so if it's a single benzene ring, that's three. The remaining one would come from maybe a single double bond elsewhere, but in the given options, it's all tetramethylbenzenes except for one option with diethyl groups.

Wait, looking at the options: all the options except D have 1, something tetramethylbenzenes. Option C has 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C8H12, right? Because benzene is C6H6, two ethyl groups add 4 carbons and 4 hydrogens (since each ethyl is CH2CH3, so two eth
