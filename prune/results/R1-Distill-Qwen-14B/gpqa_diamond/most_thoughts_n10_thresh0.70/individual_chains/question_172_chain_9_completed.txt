Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation, it's related to the thermal energy of the stars. Let me think.

So the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So the usual laws of thermodynamics apply there.

I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities, g the statistical weights, E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this case, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, so for a specific energy level, the population is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Let's denote the excited state as level i and the lower state as j. So n_i for star_1 is 2 times n_j for star_2? Or wait, maybe n_i in star_1 is twice as much as n_i in star_2? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think it means that in star_1, the fraction of iron atoms in that specific excited energy level is twice that of star_2. So let's say for a given energy level, n1 is twice n2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, the ratio would be n1/n2 = 2. But according to the Boltzmann equation, n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) ). So here, I think the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j, which is given as 1.38e-23 J. Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same, perhaps? Or maybe the question is considering that they are the same, so the ratio simplifies to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the energy difference is between the considered levels. So in the Boltzmann factor, it's ΔE over kT. So the ratio of n_i to n_j is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but here star_1 has a higher excitation. So if n1_i is the population in the excited level for star 1, and n2_i the same for star 2, then n1_i / n2_i = 2. Because star_1 is more excited, so more atoms in that level.

So according to the Boltzmann equation, for each star, n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But if we're looking at the same energy levels for both stars, then g_i and g_j are the same for both, so the ratio between stars 1 and 2 would relate their temperatures.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the ratio for each star. Let me think. For star 1, the ratio n1_i / n1_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). For star 2, n2_i /n2_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

Now, the problem states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So n1_i = 2 * n2_i. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps n1_i is twice as much as n2_i. Or maybe the ratio of n1_i to n1_j is twice the ratio of n2_i to n2_j. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on interpreting the problem.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps the excitation level is twice as high, meaning that the population in the excited state is higher. So the ratio n1_i / n1_j is higher than n2_i / n2_j. 

Wait, but the problem says the energy difference is the same for both. So the energy levels are the same; hence, the ΔE is the same for both stars. So for each star, the ratio of the populations is determined by their respective temperatures.

So let me think in terms of the ratio between the two stars. Let me denote the ratio of the excitation (n_i/n_j) for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So R1 = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

The problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice star_2's. So R1 = 2 * R2. So substituting, (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). The g_i/g_j terms cancel out, so we get exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write that down:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take the natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm. Let's write that as:

(ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

So:

(ΔE / k ) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

But wait, in the options given, I don't see any ΔE. The options are all in terms of T1 and T2 and ln(2). So perhaps the ΔE and k factors are being considered as constant, but I don't see how that would cancel out. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the energy difference is much smaller, but that's not indicated.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again. Maybe the ratio is not R1 = 2 R2, but perhaps the populations are n1_i = 2 n2_i. Or perhaps n1_i/n1_j = 2 (n2_i/n2_j). That might change things.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. But the excitation is about being in the higher energy state. So I think the ratio of the population of the excited level to the ground level (or perhaps another level) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. But given that, I think the correct approach is to model it as the ratio of excited to unexcited being twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

So, let's model it as (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 (n2_i / n2_j)

Using the Boltzmann equation, for each star:

n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, which is a common scenario unless stated otherwise. Then,

(n1_i / n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

(n2_i /n2_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio (n1_i/n1_j)/(n2_i/n2_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

But the problem states that (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 (n2_i /n2_j ), so the ratio is 2.

So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2 

Which can be written as:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )) ) = 2

Take natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = ln(2)

Rearranging:

(ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

So,

(ΔE/k) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but the options don't involve ΔE or k. So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the ratio of the populations is 2, but in the opposite way. Maybe n1_i is twice as much as n2_i, but for the same energy level. Or perhaps the ratio is between the two stars' excitation levels. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the population in the excited state is higher in star_1. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). That would fit with the problem statement. So, the same setup as before.

But then again, the equation ends up being: (ΔE/(k)) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But that's not matching any of the options given. Let me check the options again.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, so none of the options have ΔE or k. So perhaps the given equation somehow eliminates ΔE and k, but that would require more information. Or perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the excitation is in terms of the ionization or the average thermal energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the ratio of the excitation energies but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps it's a matter of the ratio of the excitation temperatures. Oh wait, wait a minute. The excitation temperature is a concept in spectroscopy that relates to the temperature at which the atoms populate energy levels according to the Boltzmann distribution. So perhaps in this problem, the effective temperature T of the star is the same as the excitation temperature.

So, the excitation temperature is given by 1/T_exc = (1/k) * (ΔE / ln( n_j / n_i ) )

Wait, no, I think the excitation temperature T_x is given by the equation:

n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T_x) )

So, T_x is the temperature that would produce the observed excitation ratio if the gas were in LTE.

But in this problem, the stellar photospheres are in LTE, so their effective temperatures are the same as their excitation temperatures. So perhaps in this case, T1 and T2 are the excitation temperatures.

Wait, but the problem is about the effective temperatures. So perhaps T1 and T2 are the effective temperatures, and their ratio is determined by the excitation levels.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because the equation I derived involves ΔE and (T1-T2), which isn't present in the options. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ratio is not (n1_i/n1_j) = 2*(n2_i/n2_j), but that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps n1_i is twice n2_i. But without knowing their respective denominators, that's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the excitation in terms of the number of atoms in the energy level relative to the total population. Let's say, the fraction f1 = n_i / (n_i + n_j) for star 1, and f2 = n_i / (n_i + n_j) for star 2. Then f1 = 2 f2.

But that complicates things because then the equations would involve n_i/(n_i + n_j) = ... which would require more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the ratio of the excitation levels without considering the denominator, which is what I initially thought.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the excitation is proportional to the population of the excited level. So if star_1 has twice the excitation, then n1_i = 2 n2_i.

But then, using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

n1_i = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * n1_j

n2_i = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * n2_j

Assuming that n_j is the same in both stars, which is probably not a valid assumption, but perhaps the question is making that simplification.

If n1_j = n2_j = n_j, then n1_i = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) n_j

n2_i = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) n_j

Given that n1_i = 2 n2_i, then:

(g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) n_j = 2 (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) n_j

Cancel terms, get:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Which is the same as before.

So, following the same steps as before, we arrive at:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) )/( T1 T2 )

But in the options, the equation is in terms of T1 and T2 without ΔE. So perhaps the question is assuming that ΔE/(k) is a constant, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is abstracted such that the equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches option D.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, because in our equation, (ΔE/k) is a factor. Unless ΔE/(k) is 1, which would be a specific case, but that's not stated in the problem.

Hmm, but the problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. Let me calculate what that would be like. The Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * T, where T is 1 K. So ΔE/(k) = T, which would be 1 K. But wait, no, ΔE/(k) is 1.38e-23 J / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, so ΔE = k * 1 K, so ΔE/(k) = 1. That would make the equation:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / ( T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D. Because the factor (ΔE/k) is 1, so it cancels out. So the equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation would be option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, let the ratios of the populations of the excited to ground levels be \(R_1 = \frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}}\) and \(R_2 = \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}\), respectively. The problem states that \(R_1 = 2 R_2\). Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
R_1 = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio \(R_1 / R_2\), the statistical weights \(g_i / g_j\) cancel out, leading to:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since \(R_1 / R_2 = 2\), we have:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The problem specifies \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and the Boltzmann constant \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches **Option D**, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

ANSWER: D
