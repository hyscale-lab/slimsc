Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. Let's see what the question says.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in a substitution reaction, specifically in something called the Hoffmann or maybe the Saytzeff elimination? Wait, no, maybe it's more about the cleavage of certain bonds. Oh right, I think when you treat a compound with red phosphorus and HI, it's a type of dehydrohalogenation or maybe an elimination reaction. Or wait, perhaps it's more about the cleavage of a C-X bond, like in a Finkelstein reaction, but that's with NaI. Hmm, wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are used in theWurtz reaction, but that's for forming alkanes. Or maybe it's about eliminating a leaving group. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus reacts with HI to form phosphine (PH3) and what else? Oh, right, when HI is used with red phosphorus, it produces H3PO3 and I2. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Red phosphorus is used in the presence of I2 to make HI, but in this case, the reagent is HI itself. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, but the exact details are a bit fuzzy for me. I think that when you have a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dihaloalkane), treating it with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the elimination of two equivalents of HI and the formation of an alkene via an elimination reaction—like a dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, that sounds right. So, the reaction is probably an elimination to form a double bond.

So, Compound X must have a structure that allows for such an elimination. That would mean that Compound X has two adjacent halogen atoms, like a vicinal dihalide. So, looking at the options, because the product after elimination would be an alkene.

Wait but the question is about the product after the reaction. So the starting material is X, which reacts with red phosphorus and HI to give a product. So the question is, what is the structure of X that will give us the product among the options provided.

So, first, I need to figure out what X is, based on the IR and NMR data provided, and then see what happens when it undergoes this elimination reaction.

Looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad peak, probably from O-H or N-H stretching. But since it's in that range, and considering the NMR, which has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet, maybe that's an aldehyde proton? Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the peak in IR is 3400–2500, which is a stretch for O-H (like in carboxylic acids), or N-H. Also, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic
