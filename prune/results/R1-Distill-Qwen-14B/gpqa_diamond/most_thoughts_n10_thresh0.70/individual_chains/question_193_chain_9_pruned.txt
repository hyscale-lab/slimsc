Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, let's see what the question says. Oh right, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, wait, parallax is related to distance... right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx is 1 over distance, right? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is distance in parsecs. 

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's simplify that. 1/(1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, but wait a second. Is that right? Let me double-check the substitution.

Plx = 1/r, so plx^5 = (1/r)^5. Then 1/(plx^5) is (r^5). So N is proportional to r^5. Oh, but wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh right, so it's like the density of stars in a shell of radius r with thickness dr. Because when you're counting stars
