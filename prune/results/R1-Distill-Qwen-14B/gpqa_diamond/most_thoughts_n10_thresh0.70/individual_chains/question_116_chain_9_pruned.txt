Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves several reactions starting from Compound A. I need to figure out what Compound D is by following the reaction steps. The options given are all cyclohexenol derivatives, so I think the final product is some kind of cyclohexenol.

Let me break down the information provided.

First, Compound A's proton NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals give information about the environment of the protons. Triplet and quartet suggest coupling between neighboring protons. 

The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H. That makes me think of something like two equivalent methyl groups. Because 6H would be three CH2 groups each with two H's? Wait, wait, no. No, wait, 6H could be three CH2 groups each with two H's, but that would be 6H. Alternatively, maybe it's two CH3 groups each with 3H, but wait, 2Ã—3 is 6. So that would make sense. But then what would cause a triplet? Maybe each methyl is next to a CH2 group. Because for a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each would split into a triplet.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 is for 6H. Let me think about common structures. For example, diethyl ether has CH3-O-CH2CH3, but that would have a quartet for the OCH2 and triplet for the OCH3. But in this problem, the integrals are 6H and 4H. So maybe the structure is something like two ethyl groups attached to something else.

Wait, ethyl groups have 2 CH2 and 1 CH3. So for two ethyl groups, it would be 6H in the CH3 (
