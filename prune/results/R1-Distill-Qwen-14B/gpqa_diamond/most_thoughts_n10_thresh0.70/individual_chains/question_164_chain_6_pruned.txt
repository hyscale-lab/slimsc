Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

So there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, their radial velocity variations are given. System_1's stars have amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. The options are A to D, some fractions.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity (RV) method is used to find the masses. The idea is that as the stars orbit each other, they cause Doppler shifts in each other's spectra. The amplitude of the RV curves relates to the mass of the companion.

Wait, but how exactly? Oh right, the radial velocity amplitude (K) for each star is inversely proportional to the mass of the other star. So K1 = (v1) and K2 = (v2). Because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity since it's less accelerated. So the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses.

The formula I think is K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2 (from the center of mass condition), so K1/K2 = M2/M1. 

Wait, so for system_1, the two stars have K amplitudes of 10 and 5. So K1 is 10, K2 is 5. Then M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So M1 is half of M2? Wait, no. Wait, M1 is the mass of the first star, M2 the second. So M1 + M2 is the total mass. But in the system, the more massive star would have a smaller velocity. So if K1 is higher, M2 is smaller than M1? Wait, no, because if M2 is smaller, M1 is larger, so K1 would be smaller. Hmm, maybe I got the ratio wrong.

Wait,
