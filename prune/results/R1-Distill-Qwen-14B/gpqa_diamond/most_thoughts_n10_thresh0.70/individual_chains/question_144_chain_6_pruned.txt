Okay, I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different values in meters.

Alright, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like distance L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find tau? I think tau is related to the particle's width. Oh right, the width Γ is connected to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I should check the units. Because Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in energy units, but tau would be in seconds. Let me think about the constants. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, but Γ is in MeV, so I need to convert units properly.

So first, I'll compute tau. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Is that right? Wait, wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, the formula is tau = ħ / Γ. Oh, but I'm mixing units because ħ is in GeV·s and Γ is in GeV. So the GeV units cancel, leaving seconds. So that's correct.

Next, I need to find gamma and beta. For that, I should find the velocity of the particle. The particle is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can use the relativistic energy equation E = gamma * m * c². But since we're working in units where c=1 (as is common in particle physics), E = gamma * m. So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So gamma is 6 and two-thirds, or 20/3.

Now, to find beta. Remember that beta = v/c, and for a particle, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So solving for beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Let me compute that. Gamma is 20/3, so gamma squared is (400/9). So 1/gamma squared is (9/400) = 0.0225. So 1 – 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.9775 is 1 - 0.0225. So square root of 0.9775 is close to sqrt(0.98) which is approximately 0.98995. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute beta using the relation:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, but since in our units, c=1, and E and m are in GeV, but in terms of units, m²c^4 is (GeV/c²)^2 * c^4 = GeV². Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Yes, that's right. So m is 1.2 GeV/c², E is 8 GeV, so m² is (1.2)^2 = 1.44 (GeV²/c^4), E² is 64 (GeV²). So (m²)/(E²) = 1.44 / 64 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, as before.

So beta is about 0.9887, and gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Now, the lifetime as seen from the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest. Because tau_rest is the proper lifetime, and the moving particle's lifetime is dilated. So tau_lab = gamma * tau = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ (6.6666667) * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds. Wait, wait, no: wait tau_rest is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So when we calculate tau_rest, it's ħ / Γ, which is 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. Then, tau_lab is gamma multiplied by tau_rest, so 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 20/3
