Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read it again carefully.

So, the problem is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, which makes the star's brightness vary. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of a star would cause a dip in brightness. The question is asking: what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Wait, no, wait. The question says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would give the same amplitude in the light curve. So the observed variation due to the spots is being compared to the variation caused by a planet transit.

Hmm. I remember that the change in brightness during a transit depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. So the formula for the change in brightness (delta F) is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the star is much brighter than the planet and the planet doesn't emit light. But wait, in this case, the spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star's brightness decreases. So the dip in brightness due to the spots might be similar to the dip caused by a planet.

Wait, but the spots are on the star's surface. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. But the problem says that the star's brightness variation is periodic due to this rotation. So if the star had a planet transiting, the dip would be the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but let me think about the brightness change due to the spots. Each spot is cooler, so when we see a spot, the star's brightness is a bit less than when it's not there. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is related to the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Calculate the change in brightness (ﾎ認) caused by the spots.
2. Compare this ﾎ認 to the ﾎ認 caused by a transiting planet.
3. Find the planet radius that would cause the same ﾎ認.

But wait, how do I calculate the brightness change due to the spots?
