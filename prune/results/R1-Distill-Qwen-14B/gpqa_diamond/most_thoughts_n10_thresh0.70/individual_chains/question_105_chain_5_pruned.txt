Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. So, the question is about figuring out the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the observed star with spots. Hmm.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. The spots cause the star's brightness to vary as it rotates, and this variation is similar to what an exoplanet would cause when transiting in front of the star. But we're supposed to find the exoplanet radius that would cause the same signal.

Wait, so the problem is comparing two scenarios: one with spots causing a brightness dip and another with an exoplanet causing a dip. The goal is to find the exoplanet radius (Rpl) relative to the star's radius (Rstar) such that the light curve amplitude is the same.

Let me think about how each of these causes a dip. For the exoplanet transit, the dip is due to the planet blocking some light. The formula for the depth of the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

For the star with spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they are facing us (as the star rotates), the star's overall brightness decreases. The brightness variation depends on the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots and the temperature difference.

The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when spots are present, the total luminosity changes. The spots contribute less, so the total luminosity is L_total = L_clean - L_spots + L_spots_new.

Wait, more accurately, the star's total flux without spots is F0 = σTeff^4. The spots have a lower temperature, T_spot = 5000K. The filling factor f is 20% of one hemisphere, so the area covered is (f * A), where A is the area of one hemisphere. But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR², so one hemisphere is
