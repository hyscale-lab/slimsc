Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of P_z in this state.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩². So I'll need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

But first, let me make sure I understand the setup. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, because the matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in the basis where P_z is diagonal. So the state given is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should simplify things because the components of the state vector correspond directly to the eigenstates of P_z.

Wait, the state vector ψ is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) in the P_z basis. So each component corresponds to the amplitude of ψ in each P_z eigenstate.

So, the eigenstates of P_z are |+ħ>, |0>, and |-ħ>, right? Because looking at the matrix for P_z, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the basis states are |1⟩ = (1, 0, 0), |2⟩ = (0,1,0), |3⟩ = (0,0,1). Therefore, P_z |1⟩ = ħ |1⟩, P_z |2⟩ = 0, and P_z |3⟩ = -ħ |3⟩.

So the state ψ is written as a linear combination of these eigenstates. The coefficients are the components of the vector. So ψ = (-1/2)|1> + (1/√2)|2> + (-1/2)|3>.

Wait, but I should check if this vector is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1. Let's compute:

| -1/2 |² = 1/4,

|1/√2 |² = 1/2,

| -1/2 |² = 1/4.

Adding them together: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, it's just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Because P_z acting on each basis state just gives the eigenvalue times the state.

So let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. The expectation value is:

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = sum (c_i^* * c_j * ⟨i| P_z |j⟩ )

But since P_z is diagonal in this basis, ⟨i| P_z |j⟩ = λ_i δ_ij, where λ_i is the eigenvalue for state |i⟩.

So, it's the sum over i of |c_i|^2 * λ_i.

The eigenvalues for P_z are, for each basis vector |1⟩: ħ, |2⟩: 0, |3⟩: -ħ.

So the components of ψ are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

Compute |c1|^2 * λ1: (1/4)* ħ,

|c2|^2 * λ2: (1/2)*0 = 0,

|c3|^2 * λ3: (1/4)*(-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Adding them: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Interesting.

Now, for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of the diagonal elements.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = sum (|c_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2 )

Compute each term:

|c1|^2 (λ1)^2 = (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = ħ²/4,

|c2|^2 (λ2)^2 = (1/2) * 0 = 0,

|c3|^2 (λ3)^2 = (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = ħ²/4.

Sum these: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check. Because P_z² would take each eigenstate to its square, right? For |1⟩, P_z² is (ħ)^2, for |3⟩ it's (ħ)^2 as well since it's (-ħ)^2. So the calculation seems correct.

So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state $\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$, which is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the basis states $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues. The coefficients of $\psi$ are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ squares the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities and squared eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
