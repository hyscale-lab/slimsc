Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's take it slow.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me draw it out mentally. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=C(CH2)- attached to the cyclohexane? Oh wait, wait. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)- attached. So it's CH2 connected to a CH that's double-bonded to another CH2? Or wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl could be -CH2-C(=CH2)-. Or perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl: so the main chain is three carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, no. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group -CH2-C(=CH2)-. No, wait, maybe it's CH2-C(=CH3)-. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about it. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is:

The substituent is CH2-C(=CH2)- attached to the cyclohexane? No, wait, maybe it's
