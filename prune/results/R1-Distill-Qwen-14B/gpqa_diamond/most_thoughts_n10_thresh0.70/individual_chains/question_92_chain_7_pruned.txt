Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact process. Let me think.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complex. Let me count the carbons. Each (CH3)2C is a substituent. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure to see how many carbons and hydrogens are involved. Alternatively, maybe I can find the molecular formula.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH... So, each (CH3)2C group has 3 carbons (the central C attached to two CH3 groups). Then the next part is CH, then CH2, then CH(CH3), then another CH2, then CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, perhaps this is a diene or something with multiple double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated system. But maybe that's not necessary for solving the problem.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation. But looking at the data given, they only provide bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh wait, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element and form isolated atoms. Carbon is a solid, so its atomization would involve breaking into C atoms.

Wait, the formula for calculating
