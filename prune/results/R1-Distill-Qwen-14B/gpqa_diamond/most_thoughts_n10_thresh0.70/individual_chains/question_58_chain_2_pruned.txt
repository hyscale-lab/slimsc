Okay, so I have this question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) QCD, C) QED, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, so what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations and are unphysical. Regularization introduces a temporary mass or cutoff to make the integrals finite, and then you remove it later, hopefully getting a finite result after renormalization.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this. Let's go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, that's the non-quantum version. In classical theories, do you get divergences? Like in electromagnetism, you have point charges and infinities come up when calculating fields at points. But do you need regularization there? No, because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical ED, you might deal with singularities, but you don't use regularization techniques. So perhaps this theory never requires regularization because it doesn't involve the same divergences that QFTs do. Or wait, but the question is about high energies. Well, classical theories don't really deal with high energies in the same way as quantum theories. So maybe D is the answer.

Wait, but looking at the other options. Option C is QED. QED definitely has issues with infinities. For example, electron
