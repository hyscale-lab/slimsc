Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when the energies are high. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like when calculations result in infinite values. These divergences usually come from integrating over very short distances or high energies, right? So regularization introduces a cutoff to make the integrals finite, then you remove it later, hopefully getting a finite result.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a theory I know a bit about. It's the quantum theory of electromagnetism. I think QED is renormalizable, which probably means it doesn't require any non-perturbative methods like regularizations in the same way other theories might. Wait, but wait. I thought that QED does have issues like the vacuum polarization and the infinite charge of point particles, which are handled through renormalization. But renormalization is a process that can involve regularization, but maybe in some formulations, QED is handled without needing additional regularizations beyond what's part of the renormalization process.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes small. But because it's a non-abelian gauge theory, it's also non-renormalizable in a certain sense, but wait, no—wait, I think QCD is a renormalizable theory. But because of things like confinement and the complexity of the theory, especially in the infrared regime, people might use things like lattice QCD, which is a form of regularization. Oh, right, because when you go to high energies, you might need to regulate the theory to handle divergences. So QCD might require regularization, especially in certain approaches like lattice gauge theories.

Superstring Theory, option A. Hmm, string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? It's a candidate for a theory that unifies all fundamental forces, including gravity. Strings don't point particles, so maybe the divergences that occur in point-particle theories are tamed. Wait, but when you calculate loop diagrams in string theory, especially at high energies, do you get divergences
