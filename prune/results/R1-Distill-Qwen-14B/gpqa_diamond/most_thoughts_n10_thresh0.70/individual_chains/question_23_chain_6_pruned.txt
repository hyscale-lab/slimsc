Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction was progressing, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the given options could be the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they undergo an addition reaction, typically following the mechanism of acid-catalyzed addition. Since the starting material has an ether linkage, but the key part is the but-3-en-1-yl group attached to the oxygen. So the structure is something like:

O
||
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the but-3-en-1-yl group would be: CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2, but wait, no. But-3-en-1-yl would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH, but that's not possible because but-3-en would have four carbons with a double bond starting at the third. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let's think about but-3-en-1-yl.

Butene is CH2=CHCH2CH2? No, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but-2-ene is CH2CH2CH=CH, no, wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2CH2CH=CH, but that's not right. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is actually CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, that's not possible because but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-C=CH? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait. Let's break it down. But-3-en-1-yl: the parent chain is butenyl, four carbons, with the double bond starting at position 3. So, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between C3 and C4? But that would be a three-membered alkene, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Oh wait! Wait a second. For the but-3-en-1-yl group, perhaps it's actually a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would be but-1-en-1-yl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this all wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is: the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the butenyl group is attached via the first carbon (en-1-yl) to the oxygen. So the structure is:

O
||
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-

Wait, but that doesn't include the double bond. Oh wait, the but-3-enyl group would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that would require five carbons? No, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's but-1-en-1-yl. No, wait. Let me clarify. The but-3-enyl group would have the formula CH2CH2CH=CH, but that's not possible because it would require four carbons with a double bond starting at the third. So perhaps the structure is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the structure as CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? No, wait, the substituents are on the second carbon. The correct structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? So, it's Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, wait, but but-3-en-
