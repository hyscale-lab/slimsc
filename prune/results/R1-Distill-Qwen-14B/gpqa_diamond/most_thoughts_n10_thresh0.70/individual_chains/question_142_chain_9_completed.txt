Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubits space. Hmm.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector (like |ψ><ψ|), but here it's a mixture of |0> and |1>. So this must be a mixed state.

I think the density matrix for a qubit can be represented in the Bloch sphere. Oh right, every density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in 3D space and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me write down ρ again. ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|) / 2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the bottom-right. So adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Divided by 2, it becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, and the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So the formula (I + r·σ)/2 is ( [1 0; 0 1] + [r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z] ) / 2.

Let me plug in the Pauli matrices. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So the expression becomes (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) / 2. Let me compute each term:

I/2 is [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]].

r_x σ_x/2 is (r_x/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]].

Similarly, r_y σ_y/2 is (r_y/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] → [[0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0]].

r_z σ_z/2 is (r_z/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2]].

Adding these together, the full expression is:

[ [0.5 + r_z/2, (r_x/2 - i r_y/2) ],
  [ (r_x/2 + i r_y/2), 0.5 - r_z/2 ] ].

Wait, but our given ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So the off-diagonal terms must be zero. That means (r_x/2 - i r_y/2) = 0. Let me set that equal to zero. So, r_x/2 - i r_y/2 = 0 → r_x = i r_y.

But r_x and r_y are real numbers because they're components of the vector r in Euclidean space. Wait, wait, because r is a real vector, the imaginary part must be zero. Let me think again. Oh, because the density matrix must be Hermitian, which it is, so the r components must be real. Therefore, the imaginary part of (r_x/2 - i r_y/2) must be zero. So, -i r_y/2 must be zero. So r_y must be zero.

And the real part of that term is r_x/2. For this to be zero, r_x must be zero. So from the off-diagonal terms, we get that both r_x and r_y are zero.

Now, looking at the diagonal terms. The diagonal entries of the density matrix are 0.5 + r_z/2 and 0.5 - r_z/2. But in our given ρ, both diagonal entries are 0.5. So:

0.5 + r_z/2 = 0.5 → r_z/2 = 0 → r_z = 0.

Wait, that would make the diagonal terms both 0.5, which matches. But wait, that can't be right. Because if r is zero vector, then the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2. Which is exactly ρ as given. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

So the position in the qubit space is the origin, right? Because the Bloch sphere has the origin as the completely mixed state. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Bloch sphere parametrizes pure states on the surface, and the completely mixed state is at the origin. So in this case, the density matrix is I/2, which is the maximally mixed state, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a real vector in 3D space, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given density matrix \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \), we observe the following:

1. The off-diagonal terms \( r_x - i r_y \) and \( r_x + i r_y \) must be zero. Since \( r_x \) and \( r_y \) are real numbers, this implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).
2. The diagonal terms \( 1 + r_z \) and \( 1 - r_z \) must both equal 1. This implies \( r_z = 0 \).

Thus, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

From the given options:

- **A)** \( (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \( (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as \( r_z = 0 \) for the given density matrix.
- **C)** \( (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as derived above.
- **D)** \( (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this does not match the given density matrix.

Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
