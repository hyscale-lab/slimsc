Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Wait, that's propene or maybe cyclopropane? But propene is more likely because it's an alkene. So, A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3? Or CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3.)

Then, A undergoes bromination in CCl4. Oh right, that's an addition reaction. Since propene has a double bond, bromine would add across it. So B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, when bromine (Br2) adds to propene, it adds across the double bond in a dibromide. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. That's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, so that's probably dehydrohalogenation. But wait, B has two bromine atoms. So when we treat that with alcoholic KOH, it would likely eliminate HBr from adjacent carbons, leading to an alkene again. But wait, the structure of 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would make CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when you eliminate
