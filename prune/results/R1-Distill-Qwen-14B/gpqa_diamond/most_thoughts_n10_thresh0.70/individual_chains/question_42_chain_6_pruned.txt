Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question gives me three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure, maybe that's not super relevant here.

The problem states that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4, and T2/T3 = 2.3. That means T1 is higher than T2, and T3 is lower than T2.

Also, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15. And Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so M2/M3 = 1.35. So M1 is a bit more massive than M2, and M2 is a bit more than M3.

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So, P3/P1 = ?

They also mention that the albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. Albedo affects how much light is reflected, so that's a factor in equilibrium temperature.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star, its orbital period, and some other factors like albedo and greenhouse effect, but since they're talking equilibrium, maybe it's simplified.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star.

Wait, but in this problem, I don't think we're given the star's luminosity directly. Or are we? Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Since the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance, and the orbital period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law. Because Kepler's law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star).

So, let's think about Kepler's third law: P² ∝ D³. So, if I can find the ratio of distances D3/D1, then I can find P3/P1 since P^2 is proportional to D^3.

But how to find the ratio of distances D3/D1?

Well, the equilibrium temperature T is related to the distance D. From the equilibrium temperature formula, T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4). So, T ∝ (1/D)^(1/2). Because L and (1-a) are constants if we're assuming the same star and same albedo for all planets.

Wait, more precisely, T =
