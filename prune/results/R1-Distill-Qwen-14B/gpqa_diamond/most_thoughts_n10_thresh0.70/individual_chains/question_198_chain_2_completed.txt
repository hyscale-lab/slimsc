Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants have something to do with how stable a complex is. Let me think through this.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species. The setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constant β for a complex tells us the tendency to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The complexes here are different orders of SCN- attached to Co(II). So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^n, where n is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4? Or wait, n is the number of SCN- attached. So Co can be in various forms: Co²+ with 0,1,2,3,4 SCN- ligands.

The problem is asking about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So that's [Co(SCN)₂]²+.

So I need to calculate the fraction of all Co species that are [Co(SCN)₂]²+.

But how do I approach this? Oh, right, using the stability constants and the concentrations. The general approach is to calculate the distribution of Co in each complex.

Stability constant β is defined as [CoL^n]/([Co][L]^n). For each complex, the formation is stepwise. Wait, no, sometimes β is given as the overall stability constant for the complex. I think β is the overall constant for the nth complex. For example, β1 is the constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait, but wait, the charges must balance. Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+, the charge is 2 - n = m+. So for n=1, charge is +1 (so [CoSCN]^+), n=2, charge is 0 ([Co(SCN)₂]), n=3, charge is -1, and n=4, charge is -2.

So the first complex is [CoSCN]^+ with β1=9. Then [Co(SCN)₂]^0 with β2=40. Then [Co(SCN)3]^- with β3=63, and [Co(SCN)4]^2- with β4=16.

Wait, but I'm not sure if β is the overall constant or the stepwise. Oh, the problem states they are the stability constants for the complexes. So each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the β would be the product of the stepwise constants up to n.

So the β values are for each complex:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co²+][SCN^-]) = 9

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂] / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^2) = 40

β3 = [Co(SCN)3^-] / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^3) = 63

β4 = [Co(SCN)4^2-] / ([Co²+][SCN^-]^4) = 16

Wait, but wait, does that make sense? Because for each βn, it's the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is given by βn.

But to find the fraction of each complex, I think I need to use these βs along with the concentrations of Co and SCN-.

The total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M. Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then, the concentrations of each complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN]^1. Similarly, [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * [SCN]^2. [Co(SCN)3^-] = β3 * x * [SCN]^3. [Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * x * [SCN]^4.

But wait, what about the free Co²+? Or are all the Co in some complex or as free ion? The total Co is 1e-2 M, which includes all the species: free Co²+ plus all the complexes.

So the sum of all the species must equal the total Co concentration.

Let me denote:

Total Co = [Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But to model this, perhaps I can express each complex in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN^-], then normalize.

Wait, but let's think about each complex as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

So the concentration of each complex is βn * [Co²+] * [SCN]^n.

But [Co²+] is part of the free ion, which is x; all the complexes are formed from x and the SCN-.

So the sum of [Co(SCN)_n] plus x equals 1e-2 M.

But wait, in the problem, [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M.

So [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Let me write expressions for each complex:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * (0.1)^1 = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)3^-] = β3 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)4^2-] = β4 * x * (0.1)^4 =16 *x *0.0001=0.0016 x.

And the free Co²+ is x.

The sum of all these should equal 1e-2 M.

So,

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 1e-2.

Let me compute the sum coefficients:

1 (from x) + 0.9 + 0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 1 + 0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So 2.3646 x = 1e-2.

So x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

So x is approximately 4.225e-3 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

[CoSCN^+] = 0.9 x ≈ 0.9 * 0.004225 ≈ 0.0038025 M.

[Co(SCN)₂] =0.4 x≈ 0.4 * 0.004225≈ 0.00169 M.

[Co(SCN)3^-] =0.063 x≈ 0.063 * 0.004225≈ 0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)4^2-] = 0.0016x≈ 0.0016 *0.004225≈ 6.76e-6 M.

Now, the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is [Co(SCN)₂], which is 0.00169 M.

So the total Co species is 1e-2 M = 0.01 M.

The fraction is (0.00169) / 0.01 = 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option D is 16.9%.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum:

The sum is x + 0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x.

x=1, so 1*(1) + 0.9*(1) + 0.4*(1) +0.063*(1)+0.0016*(1).

Wait, 1 +0.9=1.9, 1.9+0.4=2.3, 2.3 +0.063=2.363, 2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So 2.3646 x = 0.01.

x=0.01/2.3646 ≈ 0.004225. Right.

Then,

[Co(SCN)₂] is 0.4 x. 0.4 *0.004225=0.00169.

So 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169 → 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I thought dithiocyanato is two SCN-, but sometimes that could refer to different complexes. Oh, but in this case, the [Co(SCN)₂] is the correct one.

So the answer should be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \), corresponding to the complexes \([Co(\text{SCN})]^+\), \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]\), \([Co(\text{SCN})_3^-]\), and \([Co(\text{SCN})_4^{2-}]\), respectively.

The concentration of each cobalt species can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration \([Co^{2+}] = x\), as follows:

\[
\begin{align*}
[\text{Co}^{2+}] &= x, \\
[\text{Co(SCN)}^+] &= \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9x(0.1) = 0.9x, \\
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] &= \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40x(0.1)^2 = 0.4x, \\
[\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] &= \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63x(0.1)^3 = 0.063x, \\
[\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}] &= \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16x(0.1)^4 = 0.0016x.
\end{align*}
\]

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

\[
x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = 10^{-2}.
\]

Simplifying the coefficients:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

Thus:

\[
2.3646x = 10^{-2} \implies x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}.
\]

Now, calculate the concentration of \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]\):

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = 0.4x = 0.4(0.004225) \approx 0.00169 \, \text{M}.
\]

The percentage of \([Co(\text{SCN})_2]\) among all cobalt species is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{c(\text{Co})} \times 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \times 100 \approx 16.9\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**.
