Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and energy uncertainty. Hmm, let me think. The question says an electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE. The options are from 1e-18 J up to 1e-16 J.

Wait, right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. I remember that it states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π. But for minimum uncertainty, it's usually taken as Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes approximated as just ħ. Oh, but sometimes the formula is written as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So for estimation, I think Δp can be approximated as ħ/(2Δx), but maybe for an order of magnitude, I can use ħ/Δx.

So first, I'll need to find Δp. Because once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy. Wait, but how do I get from Δp to ΔE?

Oh right, the energy of a particle is given by E = p²/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would involve the uncertainty in p squared. Hmm, but actually, maybe I should think in terms of the uncertainty in p leading to an uncertainty in E. Alternatively, perhaps using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time? Wait, no, because the question is about energy uncertainty due to position uncertainty. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The minimum uncertainty in energy comes from the uncertainty in momentum. Since E is related to p, the uncertainty in E would be related to the uncertainty in p. Let me think. The
