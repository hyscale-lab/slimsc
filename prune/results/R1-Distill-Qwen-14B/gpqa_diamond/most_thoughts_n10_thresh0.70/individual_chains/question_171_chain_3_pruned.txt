Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that electrophilic substitution usually refers to reactions where a hydrogen atom in an aromatic ring is replaced by an electrophilic group, like bromine. But wait, the question says it's an excess of bromine, so maybe it's a bromination reaction?

The substances given are all substituted benzene rings. Let me list them out:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when each undergoes bromination. We need to arrange them from least to most para-isomer yield.

Wait, in electrophilic substitution, the positioning of the substituent directs where the new group will add. If the substituent is a meta director, then the incoming group goes meta. If it's a para director, the group adds para. But wait, some substituents are both deactivating and meta-directing, others are deactivating and para-directing? Or wait, activating groups are ortho/para directors, and deactivating are meta directors, except for nitro groups which are meta directors.

Wait, let me think. The directing effects:

- Electron-donating groups (activating) are ortho/para directors. Like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3 (toluene), etc.

- Electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating) are meta directors. Like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR (since they're electron-withdrawing), -Cl (though Cl is a bit tricky because it's slightly deactivating but ortho/para due to resonance? Or is it deactivating and meta?)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify.

The substituents can be either activating or deactivating. Activating groups donate electrons, typically through resonance or induction, making the ring more reactive and directing incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups do the opposite, making the ring less reactive and directing to meta positions.

But wait, some substituents can be deactivating but still direct ortho/para. For example, Cl is a deactivating group due to its electronegativity (electron-withdrawing by induction), but it's ortho/para directing because of its resonance effect. Wait, no, Cl is an ortho/para director because when the Cl's lone pairs can be donated into the ring, but since it's more about the inductive effect being stronger, Cl is actually deactivating. So Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para director. Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Alternatively:

- Strong activating groups (like -NH2, -OCH3) are strong ortho/para directors.

- Moderate activating groups (
