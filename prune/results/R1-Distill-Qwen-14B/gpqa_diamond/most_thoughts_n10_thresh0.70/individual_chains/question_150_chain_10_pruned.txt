Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, okay, so let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, wait, X is halogens, but there's no X here. N is 1. So, plugging in: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (1), and maybe an aldehyde or ketone (another 1). Or maybe an amine? Wait, the formula has an N, so maybe an amide or something else.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a strong signal, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the compound.

Another peak is at 6.98 ppm, a doublet (2H), and 6.51 ppm, another doublet (2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The first doublet (6.98) might be ortho to a substituent, and the second (6.51) could be para. Wait, or maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. Let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, you have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if it's a substituent like -OCH3, the aromatic protons would be a doublet each. Wait, but in this case, 6.98 is downfield, maybe due to electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, but the substituent could also be an aldehyde or something else.

Then there's 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet integrating to 2H.
