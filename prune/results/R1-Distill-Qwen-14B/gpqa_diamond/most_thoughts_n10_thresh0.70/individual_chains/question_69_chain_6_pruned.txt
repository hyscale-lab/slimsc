Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8 × 10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D, each with different resolutions in meters.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the particle’s velocity and the speed of light.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right? But I also remember that for high energies, particles are moving at speeds very close to the speed of light, so v ≈ c. Therefore, beta (v/c) is approximately 1, and gamma can be approximated using energy considerations.

The energy of the particle is given as 27 GeV. The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So, the energy E is related to the mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Let me think: since E is much larger than mc², I can approximate E ≈ pc. So pc = E = 27 GeV. Then, p = E/(c) = 27 GeV/c.

Wait, but units here are a bit confusing. Maybe I should calculate gamma. Gamma is E/(mc²). Since E is 27 GeV and mc² is 3.41 GeV, gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 7.9 is 3.41*(7 +0.9) = 23.87 +3.069=26.939. Oh, that's close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.91, maybe around 7.91.

So gamma is about 7.91. Then the observed lifetime τ is gamma * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s, so τ ≈ 7.91 * 8e-16 = let's compute that. 7 *8=56, 0.91*8≈7.28, so 56+7.28=63.28, so 63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it precisely. 7.91 *8 = 63.28, so 63.28e-16 s = 6.328e-15 s.

Now, the lifetime is important because the particles won't travel far if the detector's resolution isn't good enough. The decay length L is approximately c*τ. Because the particle moves at speed v ≈ c.

So L = c * τ = c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau_0, so the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. The distance the particle travels before decaying is v multiplied by that. Since v ≈ c, L ≈ c * gamma * tau_0.

So let's compute that. c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s.

Let me compute that step by step. 3e8 * 6.328e-15 = 3 *6.328 =18.984, and 1e8 *1e-15 = 1e-7. So 18.984e-7 meters. Which is 1.8984e-6 meters. Approximately 1.9e-6 meters.

But wait, the question isn't directly asking for the decay length. It's asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think the problem is about the decay length and how
