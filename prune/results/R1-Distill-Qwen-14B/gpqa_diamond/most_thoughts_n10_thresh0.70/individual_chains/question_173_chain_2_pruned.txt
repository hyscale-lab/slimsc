Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that an electron is traveling at a speed v of 2 times 10^8 meters per second along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, of the electron. The options are given as A to D, with each being a different order of magnitude in joules.

Hmm. I remember this has to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Right, that's the one where you can't precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least on the order of Planck's constant divided by 4π, or something like that. Oh wait, the formula I think is Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But for an order-of-magnitude estimate, maybe they just use ħ as Planck's constant over 2π, which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So the first step is probably to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, using the uncertainty in position. Then, use that to find the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. But wait, how does Δp relate to ΔE?

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives us the minimum uncertainty in momentum when the position is uncertain. So Δp is approximately ħ / (2Δx). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as Δp ≈ ħ / Δx, depending on whether you take the 1/(2π) factor into account or not. For an estimation, maybe it's okay to ignore the constants and just go with Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

But let me get the exact formula right. The uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So in the minimum case, Δx * Δp = ħ/2, so Δp = ħ/(2Δx). So I should use that formula.

So, let's plug in the numbers. Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, nanometers to meters. 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters times 0.1, so 1e-10 m. Wait no, 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m. Wait, no. Wait, 1 nm is 1e-9 m. So 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 1e-9 m = 1e-10 m. Yeah, that's right.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.
