Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and how they affect the brightness variations observed, comparing that to an exoplanet's effect. Interesting.

Alright, the problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness changes. But the question is, if instead of spots, we had an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, what size planet would produce the same brightness variation?

Wait, so the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) caused by the spots and compare it to that caused by an exoplanet. The goal is to find the planet-to-star radius ratio (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same amplitude.

First, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the light dip is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula is roughly (Rp/Rstar)^2, since area scales with the square of radius. But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a variation, so I need to model how that works.

The star has spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the stellar surface covered by spots. So 20% of the star's surface is cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into view and then are hidden as it spins. Since it's only one hemisphere, the spots would be visible as they rotate into and out of our line of sight.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so T_spot = 5000K. The brightness variation comes from the change in the star's apparent brightness as spots rotate into view. The spots are darker, so when they are on the visible side, the star appears a bit dimmer.

Wait, but how does this affect the overall brightness? The star's total luminosity is the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas. The flux from the star without spots is higher in the unspotted regions. So when the spots rotate into view, the
