Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets and studying the universe's expansion. The question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. A S/N of at least 10 is needed for detection.

Each option is a different star with varying distances and absolute magnitudes. Wait, the absolute magnitude is given as 15 mag for options c to f. Oh, right, absolute magnitude tells us the intrinsic brightness of the star. The apparent magnitude, which we see from Earth, depends on the distance. The closer the star, the brighter it appears.

So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent magnitude. The formula to convert absolute magnitude (M) to apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs. 

Let me compute each one:

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star, one of the brightest in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.7. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. So, if it's super bright, then the S/N should be easily above 10. 

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. I remember it's about magnitude 2, but varies a bit. So, that's dimmer than Canopus. But still, a magnitude 2 star should be detectable, I guess. Because higher S/N would come from brighter stars.

Options c to f: all have M=15, but different distances. Let me compute each.

Option c: 10 pc. So, m =15 +5*log10(10/10) =15 + 5*0=15. So apparent magnitude 15.

Option d: 200 pc. m=15 +5*log10(200/10)=15+5*log20=15+5*(1.3010)=15 +6.505=21.505. So m≈21.5.

Option e: 5 pc. m=15 +5*log10(5/10)=15+5*(-0.3010)=15 -1.505=13.495. So about 13.5.

Option f: 50 pc. m=15 +5*log10(50/10)=15+5*log5=15 +5*(0.69897)=15+3.495=18.495. So about 18.5.

Now, I need to figure out which of these stars would have a S/N ≥10 per binned pixel in 1 hour with ESPRESSO.

I'm not exactly sure about the exact S/N for each magnitude. But I think that more distant stars (higher magnitudes) would have lower S/N. So which stars are bright enough?

ESPRESSO's sensitivity: I recall that it's good for stars down to about magnitude 20, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but I think for high-resolution spectroscopy, the S/N depends on the star's brightness and exposure time.

Another approach: the S/N per pixel increases with the flux. The flux received from a star depends on its apparent magnitude. The formula for flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m). But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

I remember that for a given instrument, there's a formula for S/N ratio per pixel. Maybe something like S/N = (flux * exposure time)^(1/2) / noise. But without knowing the specific noise level, perhaps I should refer to typical S/N vs. magnitude curves for ESPRESSO.

Wait, I think ESPRESSO can achieve a certain S/N for a given magnitude in a certain exposure time. Let me think: for example, for a 1-hour exposure, how bright does a star need to be to achieve S/N of 10?

I found in my notes (or maybe it's from knowledge) that ESPRESSO can reach S/N ~10 for stars around magnitude 20 in 10 minutes. Wait, but the question is 1 hour, which is longer, so it should go further. Let me see: since S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time. So if a S/N of 10 is achieved in 10 minutes, in 60 minutes (6x longer), S/N would be 10 * sqrt(6) ≈24.5, which is way above 10. So, stars fainter than that could be detectable. Hmm, no, wait, that's not right. Because if a star is too faint, even with longer exposure, the noise might go up. No, the formula for S/N is S/N = (count rate * t)^(1/2) /
