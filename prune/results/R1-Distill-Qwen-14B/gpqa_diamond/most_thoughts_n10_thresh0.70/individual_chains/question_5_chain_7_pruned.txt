Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The operator in question is P, which is a vector operator. The problem says it's along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. Hmm, that probably means the direction is defined by angles theta and phi, but since it's in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or 180 degrees, maybe? Or wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle phi is 0 if it's along positive x, 90 along z, etc. Wait, no, actually phi is measured from the x-axis. So in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or pi/2, depending on orientation. Hmm, maybe I don't need to worry about that right now.

The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So we're looking for an eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P. Each component (Px, Py, Pz) is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I should write each of them down.

Px: (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py: (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz: (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, I remember that the total operator P is the vector sum, so P = Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz * n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) wait no, wait. The direction vector n is usually given in spherical coordinates with components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), I think. But since it's in the x-z plane, that means phi (the azimuthal angle) is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, direction n is in the x-z plane, so it can be expressed as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) where θ is the angle from the x-axis towards z. Like, when θ=0, it's along x, θ=90 degrees, it's along z. So n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ). So the operator P is P = (n_x) * Px + (n_z) * Pz.

So let me write that out. So P = n_x * Px + n_z * Pz. Since n_x is cosθ, and n_z is sinθ, right?

Wait wait, no. Wait, the direction vector is n, so the operator is P · n. So each component of P is multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So Px is multiplied by n_x, Py by n_y, and Pz by n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So Py is multiplied by zero. So the operator P becomes P = n_x * Px + n_z * Pz.

So substituting the matrices:

n_x is cosθ, n_z is sinθ.

So P = (ħ/2) [ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let me compute the sum inside the brackets first.

cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives:

[ [0, cosθ],
  [cosθ, 0] ]

sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives:

[ [sinθ, 0],
  [0, -sinθ] ]

Adding these two matrices:

Top left: 0 + sinθ = sinθ

Top right: cosθ + 0 = cosθ

Bottom left: cosθ + 0 = cosθ

Bottom right: 0 + (-sinθ) = -sinθ

So the matrix becomes:

[[sinθ, cosθ],
 [cosθ, -sinθ]]

And then multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P is:

(ħ/2) * [[sinθ, cosθ],
          [cosθ, -sinθ]]

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the equation is [P] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = λ |v>, and λ here is +ħ/2.

Wait, so the equation is:

(ħ/2) * [[sinθ, cosθ],
          [cosθ, -sinθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, but we can factor out the ħ/2 on both sides,
