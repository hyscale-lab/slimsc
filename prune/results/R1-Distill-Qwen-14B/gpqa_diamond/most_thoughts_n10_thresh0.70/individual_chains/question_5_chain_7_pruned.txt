Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator's components are given along the x, y, and z directions. The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, which probably means it's in the X-Z plane, so the angle θ would be measured from the x-axis, right?

Wait, the question says the operator is given for each component: Px, Py, Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, let's jot down what each component is.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row [0, 1] and second [1, 0]. So Px = (ħ/2) * σx, where σx is the Pauli X matrix.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix: σy multiplied by (ħ/2).

Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]], so that's σz multiplied by (ħ/2).

But wait, the operator we're considering is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So the direction vector is (n_x, 0, n_z). Or wait, no, any direction in the x-z plane would have direction vector (l, m, 0) where l^2 + m^2 =1? Wait, no, the x-z plane is where y=0, so the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the angle from the x-axis. Or maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ), I need to be careful.

Wait, usually, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, but since here the direction is in x-z, perhaps θ is measured from the x-axis. So (cosθ, 0, sinθ) would be the direction vector. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the direction vector is (n_x, n_y, n_z) with n_y=0, but that's okay. So the operator P, along n, is P = n_x Px + n_z Pz, since Py's coefficient is zero.

Wait, no. Because P is a vector operator, so P = n · (Px, Py, Pz), right? So P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0, so P becomes n_x Px + n_z Pz.

But wait, what are the components of n? Let me think. The direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. So nx² + nz² =1 because it's a
