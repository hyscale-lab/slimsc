Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to solve it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think refers to the Sz operator. So Sz |up> = (ħ/2)|up> and Sz |down> = -(ħ/2)|down>.

The question then asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Wait, let me parse that. The operator's matrix has zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would look like:

[ 0    (ħ/2) ]
[ (ħ/2) 0   ]

So that's the operator. Hmm, that looks familiar. That's the form of the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply each element by ħ/2, we get exactly this matrix. So A is (ħ/2) times sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, wait. Let me think, the Pauli matrices are usually written as:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So yes, the given operator A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, because A is a scalar multiple of sigma_x.

What are the eigenstates of sigma_x? They are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. I remember that the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), multiplied by appropriate factors. Wait, more precisely, the eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

So, the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the state is |alpha>. Then, also compute the expectation value of the operator A.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because the question says it's proportional to that given vector. So the state is |alpha> = C*( (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ), where C is the normalization constant.

To find C, the sum of the squares of the amplitudes should be 1.

The amplitude for |up> is (1+i), and for |down> is (2 - i). So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because the real part is 1, imaginary part is 1.

|2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So C is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next step is to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A (i.e., |+x> and |-x>), because the measurement probabilities are the square of the coefficients in this basis.

So, let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

Similarly, |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

We can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

We need to find a and b.

Let me write this out:

a |+x> + b |-x> = [a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)] + [b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)]

Combine the terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So equate the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i) / sqrt(7)

( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i ) / sqrt(7)

So I have two equations:

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Let me solve for a and b.

Adding Equations 1 and 2:

( a + b ) + (a - b ) = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
2a = (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
a = (3 * sqrt(2) )/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Similarly, subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

( a + b ) - (a - b ) = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
2b = [ (1+i -2 +i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
2b = [ (-1 + 2i ) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
b = (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2)/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Hmm, let me compute a and b more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the right-hand sides:

Equation 1: a + b = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) ?

Wait no, wait. Wait, let me reevaluate. When I add Equations 1 and 2:

Equation 1: a + b = (1 +i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Adding gives 2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
(1+i +2 -i ) = 3
So 2a=3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
a= (3/2) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtract Equations 2 from 1:

Equation 1 minus Equation 2: 2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
(1 +i -2 +i) = (-1 + 2i)
So 2b = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Thus, b = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))

Okay, so a and b are known. Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) = (3)/(sqrt(14)) * sqrt(2) ?

Wait, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(2/7). So 3/(2 sqrt(7/2)) )?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute a squared.

a = [3 sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

So a squared is [ (9 * 2) ] / (4 *7 ) = (18)/(28) = 9/14.

Similarly, compute |b|^2.

b = [ (-1 +2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

The magnitude squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 ]

Wait, [sqrt(2)/ (2 sqrt(7)) ] squared is (2)/(4*7) )= 1/(14)

And the numerator is (1 +4 )=5.

So |b|^2 = 5 * (1/14) ) =5/14.

Wait wait, let me compute that again. Let me compute |b|²:

b = [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7))
So |b|^2 = | (-1 +2i) |^2 * (sqrt(2))^2 / ( (2 sqrt(7))^2 )

Compute each part:

| -1 + 2i |² = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5

(sqrt(2))² =2

Denominator: (2 sqrt(7))² =4 *7=28

So |b|² = 5 * 2 /28 =10/28=5/14.

Similarly, |a|^2 is (3^2) * (sqrt(2))^2 / ( (2 sqrt(7))^2 )

Wait, no, a is [3 sqrt(2) ]/(2 sqrt(7)), so |a|² = [9 * 2 ] / (4 *7 )= 18/28 =9/14.

So |a|^2 =9/14, |b|^2=5/14.

Wait, but wait! 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, which makes sense.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. Option D is 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match. But let me think again because perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should have used the basis states correctly. Wait, the eigenstates of A are the same as sigma_x, so |+x> and |-x>.

So to find the probability, we can compute the overlap of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |–x>, square them to get probabilities.

Let me try that method.

Given |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2 )

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is:

[1/sqrt(2)] [ <up| + <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Which simplifies to:

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

= [ (1 +i + 2 -i ) ] / (sqrt(14) )

= 3 / sqrt(14)

So | < +x | alpha > |² = (3^2) / (14 )=9/14 ≈0.6429.

Similarly for |–x>:

|–x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2 )

So inner product is:

[1/sqrt(2) ] [ <up| - <down| ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i ) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

= (1 +i -2 +i ) / sqrt(14 )

= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

So same as before, probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So the first part of the problem is done.

Now the second part is to find the average value (expectation value) of operator A.

Operator A is (ħ/2) sigma_x. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is < alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

Another approach: since sigma_x is the Pauli X, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |+x> and |-x>.

So the expectation value is sum( p_i * lambda_i ), where p_i is the probability of each eigenstate and lambda_i is the eigenvalue.

So:

< sigma_x > = (9/14)(+1) + (5/14)(-1) ) = (9 -5)/14 =4/14 =2/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/(7).

Wait that's one approach. Alternatively, I can compute it directly.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is a state, the expectation value of A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

A is (ħ/2) sigma_x. So:

< A > = (ħ/2) < alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

We can compute sigma_x |alpha> and then find the inner product.

But perhaps using the basis approach is easier.

So sigma_x |alpha> is:

sigma_x [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Since sigma_x |up> = |down>
sigma_x |down> = |up>

So sigma_x acting on |alpha> gives:

(1+i) sigma_x |up> + (2 -i) sigma_x |down> ) / sqrt(7)
= (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ) / sqrt(7)

So,

sigma_x |alpha> = [ (2 -i)|up> + (1+i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Then, < alpha | sigma_x | alpha > is [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] * [ (2 -i)|up> + (1 +i)|down> ] /7

Compute this inner product:

(1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) all over 7.

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1*2) + (1*(-i)) + (-i *2) + (-i * (-i) )

= 2 -i -2i + i²

=2 -3i -1 (since i²=-1)

= (2-1) -3i = 1-3i.

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i + (-1)
= (2-1) -3i
=1-3i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 +i) =2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
=2 +2i +i +i²
=2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

So adding these two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i )= 2.

So the inner product is 2/7.

Wait, I thought I had 1-3i +1+3i = 2. So the entire thing is 2/7.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

Thus, <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now, looking at the options, option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7.

Wait, in our calculation, the probabilities were 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Which is approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So option A matches.

But let me check the options.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Yes. So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively.

The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \), calculate the norm:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle,
\]

where:

\[
a = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
b = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|a|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429,
\]

\[
|b|^2 = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), matching the first part of option A.

To compute the average value of \( A \), note that \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) in \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle \cdot (+1) + \langle -x|\alpha\rangle \cdot (-1) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

This matches the third part of option A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
