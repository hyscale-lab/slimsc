Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to make sense of it step by step. 

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but isn't that the same as the ejecta moving towards the Galaxy's center at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame? Because in relativity, velocities are relative between frames. So I think that's correct.

The problem asks: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, so time isn't the same in both frames because of time dilation. I remember that in special relativity, moving clocks run slower. So the time experienced in one frame affects how much time has passed in the other.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s. But because of relativity, the distance covered in each frame will differ because of time dilation.

So the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I need to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame during that same interval. Once I have that, I can multiply by the velocity to get the distance.

I remember the time dilation formula: t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/c²), but since the motion is along the x-axis (they're moving directly towards each other), the velocity is only in the x-direction. So the formula simplifies when considering events at the same point in one frame. Wait, but in this case, the events are the start and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end) are at the same location (since it's the ejecta's frame). So the time dilation formula would just be t = gamma * t', because the x is zero for the events in the ejecta's frame.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 60,000 km/s. Wait, let me calculate the value of v in terms of c. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times c. Because 60,000 divided by 300,000 is 0.2. So v = 0.2c.

Calculating gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). What's the square root of 0.96? Let me think: sqrt(0.81) is 0.9, sqrt(0.96) is a bit higher. Let me compute it. 0.96 is 96/100. The square of 0.98 is 0.9604, because 98^2 is 9604. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98, but slightly less. Hmm, but for precise calculation, maybe I should use a calculator, but since I can't, I'll proceed with an approximation.

Wait, let me think: sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

Wait, no, wait. Because 0.9798^2 = 0.96020004, which is a bit over. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 0.98^2: 0.98 * 0.98 = (1 - 0.02)^2 = 1 - 0.04 + 0.0004 = 0.9604. So sqrt(0.9604)=0.98. But 0.96 is a little less than 0.9604, so sqrt(0.96) is a bit less than 0.98. Let's say approximately 0.9798, as I thought before.

So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. So approximately 1.0206 times the time in the ejecta frame is the time in the Galaxy frame.

Wait, no. Wait, the time in the Galaxy frame (t) is gamma multiplied by t' (the time in the ejecta frame), because t' = t / gamma. Or wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. In the rest frame S, a clock moving at velocity v in the x-direction will show a time t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ), right? So t' is less than t, which is time dilation. So t = t' * gamma.

Yes, that's correct. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer: t = gamma * t'. So t = 1.0206 * 50 seconds. Let's compute that: 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 50 * 1.02 = 51.0 seconds approximately. But I'll be more precise.

Wait, 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds, approximately.

Wait, but I think I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.979795897. So gamma is 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020615558. So gamma ≈ 1.0206156.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206156 * 50 = 51.03078 seconds.

Wait, but let me think again. The time in the Galaxy frame is longer than in the ejecta frame because the ejecta is moving fast. So when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, more time has passed in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but no, wait. Let me think about it again. If I'm in the Galaxy's frame, and the ejecta is moving towards me at 0.2c, then from my perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow. So for every second that passes in my frame, only a bit less passes in the ejecta's frame. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's time. So yes, t = gamma * t'.

So, the time in Galaxy frame is 50 * gamma seconds. So t = 50 * 1.0206156 ≈ 51.03078 seconds.

Wait, but wait! Let me think about it another way. If I'm in the Galaxy's frame, and the ejecta is moving, then the ejecta's clock runs slower. So for each second in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock would have advanced by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) seconds. So the time t' that has passed in the ejecta's frame is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So if t' is 50 seconds, then t = t' / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 50 / 0.9797959 ≈ 50 * 1.0206156 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame is approximately 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but the problem is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So the distance is speed multiplied by time in the Galaxy's frame.

So distance = velocity * time = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 = let's compute that.

60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. Then 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km. But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 * (50 + 1.03) = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000; 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800. Total is 3,061,800 km.

But wait, my approximate gamma was 1.0206, leading to about 51.03 seconds, and thus 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, but wait, I got 3,061,800, which isn't an option. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Maybe my initial approximation of gamma as 1.0206 is a bit off, and maybe that's why the calculation yields a number close to 3.06 million.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me calculate sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = sqrt(0.96). Let's compute this using more precise methods.

We know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is just a bit above 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is 0.98 - (0.9604 - 0.96)/(2*0.98) ). The difference is 0.9604 - 0.96 = 0.0004. So the linear approximation gives sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98 - (0.0004)/(2*0.98) ) = 0.98 - (0.0004)/(1.96) ) = 0.98 - 0.00020408 ≈ 0.9797959.

So gamma is 1 / 0.9797959 ≈ 1.0206155.

So t = 50 * 1.0206155 ≈ 51.030775 seconds.

So distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.030775 s = let's calculate this precisely.

60,000 * 51.030775 = 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000, and 60,000 * 0.030775 = 1,846.5. So total is 3,060,000 + 1,846.5 = 3,061,846.5 km. That's approximately 3,061,846 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close but 1,846 km less. So why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe the question is being approached incorrectly. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy, and in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the velocity is the same in both frames, just opposite in direction. But the time experienced is different due to time dilation.

Wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add like that. Oh wait, but no, the question says both are inertial frames, so perhaps we can treat it as a simple velocity addition problem. Wait, but wait, actually, the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that's the relative velocity. So the velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

But wait, velocity addition in relativity doesn't just add in the same way as Galilean relativity. Oh, but wait, in the problem, it's stated that both are inertial frames, which implies that the velocity between them is such that each sees the other moving at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but that would require that each frame sees the other moving at v, which in special relativity, you can't have both moving at the same speed towards each other because of the velocity addition formula. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, but the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed is 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So perhaps the velocities are equal and opposite, but that's only approximately true in classical mechanics. In relativity, if the Galaxy is at rest, and the ejecta is moving at v, then the Galaxy would see the ejecta moving at v, and the ejecta would see the Galaxy moving at v'. But according to the velocity addition formula, v' = (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²), where u is the speed of the moving frame relative to the stationary frame. Wait, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, no, in this case, the problem directly states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So u (the relative speed) is 60,000 km/s in the opposite direction. So perhaps the velocity isn't symmetric, but the problem states it this way, so perhaps I can take it as given.

So, the key is to compute the time in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

So, using the time dilation formula, t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))) * t'.

So v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206155.

So t = 50 * 1.0206155 ≈ 51.030775 seconds.

So the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s for 51.030775 seconds in the Galaxy's frame.

Distance = speed * time = 60,000 * 51.030775 ≈ let's compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.

60,000 * 1.030775 = 60,000 * 1 = 60,000; 60,000 * 0.030775 = 1,846.5.

So 60,000 + 1,846.5 = 61,846.5.

So total distance is 3,000,000 + 61,846.5 = 3,061,846.5 km.

But the options don't have that exact number. The closest is option D: 3,060,000 km.

But perhaps I made an approximation error. Let's compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So v = 60,000 km/s, c = 300,000 km/s.

v² = (60,000)^2 = 3.6e9 (km^2/s^2).

c² = (3e5)^2 = 9e10 (km^2/s^2).

v²/c² = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = 0.979795897.

So gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020615558.

So t = 50 * 1.020615558 ≈ 51.0307779 seconds.

So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0307779 s = 60,000 * 51.0307779 = let's compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.0307779 = 60,000 * 1 = 60,000; 60,000 * 0.0307779 ≈ 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800; 60,000 * 0.0007779 ≈ 46.674.

So 60,000 * 0.0307779 ≈ 1,800 + 46.674 = 1,846.674.

So 60,000 * 1.0307779 ≈ 60,000 + 1,846.674 ≈ 61,846.674.

Adding to 3,000,000 gives 3,061,846.674 km. So approximately 3,061,847 km.

But the options don't have that. Option D is 3,060,000 km. So I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the distance in the ejecta's frame and then convert it.

Wait, no, the question asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So the approach should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore time dilation and just compute using the given 50 seconds. So 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But that's option B. But that would be incorrect because time dilation should be considered.

Wait, but maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.

The question says, "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer. So the distance is (v * t') * gamma, where t' is 50 s.

Wait, no, v is 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance would be v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. And t = gamma * t' = (1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) * t'.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s for t = gamma * t' seconds. So distance is 60,000 * gamma * t'.

Hmm, so let me recompute with more exact numbers.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020615558.

So t = 50 * 1.020615558 ≈ 51.0307779 s.

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0307779 s = 60,000 * 51.0307779.

Let me compute 60,000 * 51.0307779:

51.0307779 * 60,000 = (50 + 1.0307779) * 60,000 = 50 *60,000 + 1.0307779 *60,000.

50 *60,000 = 3,000,000.

1.0307779 *60,000 = (1 *60,000) + (0.0307779 *60,000)= 60,000 + 1,846.674 = 61,846.674.

So total is 3,000,000 + 61,846.674 = 3,061,846.674 km.

So approximately 3,061,846.674 km.

Looking at the options again, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. The difference is about 1,846 km, which is about 0.06% of the total. It's possible that the question expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to a distance of approximately 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me think again: in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So in their own frame, they are stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So how far does the Galaxy move in their frame during 50 seconds? That's 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But that's the distance from the Galaxy's perspective in the ejecta's frame. But the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I should consider length contraction. Wait, but length contraction is in the direction of motion. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the distance is proper length, but in the ejecta's frame, the distance is contracted.

Wait, no. Because the Galaxy is at rest in its own frame, and the ejecta is moving towards it. So in the Galaxy's frame, the distance is proper. But the ejecta's frame is moving, so the distance they measure is contracted.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the distance the ejecta travels as the proper distance in the Galaxy's frame multiplied by gamma.

No, wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of events. The start and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta's frame are two events. In the ejecta's frame, these events happen at the same location (since it's their own rest frame), so the time between is 50 seconds, and the distance they move is zero in their own frame. But in the Galaxy's frame, these events are separated in space and time.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformation equations. Let me consider the two events: the start (t'=0, x'=0) and the end (t'=50, x'=0) in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them, so during those 50 seconds, the Galaxy would have moved 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km towards the ejecta. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy has moved 3 million km closer.

But the question is, how far does the ejecta move in the Galaxy's frame? So the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be the same as the distance the Galaxy moves in the ejecta's frame, but adjusted for time dilation. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the time is longer, leading to a greater distance.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, so the Galaxy would have moved 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving for more than 50 seconds, so the distance is greater.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is correct, and the exact distance is about 3,061,846 km, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question expects an approximate answer, leading to option D. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express gamma with more precise decimals. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / 0.979795897 = approximately 1.020615558.

So t = 50 * 1.020615558 = 51.0307779 seconds.

So 60,000 km/s * 51.0307779 s = 60,000 * 51.0307779 = 3,061,846.674 km.

But the options don't have this exact value. The closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute 0.9797959^2 = (approx) 0.960000000000000000000000... So that's correct.

So gamma is 1.020615558.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use the approximation gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), which is an approximation for small v. Since 0.2c is 0.2, which is not that small, but perhaps acceptable for an approximate calculation.

So gamma ≈ 1 + (0.2)^2/(2*(1)) )? Wait, no, the expansion is gamma = 1 + (v^2)/(2c^2) + ... for small v.

But 0.2 is not that small, so maybe this approach isn't accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to compute using v = 60,000 km/s and time t = 50 s without considering time dilation. So 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's the Galilean approach, which isn't correct according to relativity.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck because the calculated answer doesn't exactly match any of the options, but option D is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the distance from the perspective of the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and the time experienced is 50 * gamma seconds. So the distance is 60,000 * 50 * gamma.

Wait, no, that's the same as what I've been calculating. So 60,000 * 50 * gamma = 3,000,000 * 1.020615558 ≈ 3,061,846.674 km.

So again, D is the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore time dilation, leading to 3,000,000 km, but that's option B. But that would be incorrect as per relativity.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using a different approach. Let's consider the proper time and how it relates.

Proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end) happen at the same place. In the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end of the 50-second interval) are at the same place, so their proper time is 50 seconds. In the Galaxy's frame, the events are separated by distance and time.

So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is speed * time, where time is the time between the two events as measured in the Galaxy's frame.

Using the Lorentz transformation, t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²). But in the ejecta's frame, x' = 0 for both events, so t = gamma * t'.

So t = 50 * gamma.

So the distance is v * t = v * gamma * t'.

Which is 60,000 km/s * gamma * 50 s = 60,000 * 50 * gamma.

Which again gives 3,000,000 * gamma ≈ 3,061,846 km.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 3,061,846 km, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D) 3,060,000 km.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use the approximation gamma = 1.02, leading to 3,000,000 * 1.02 = 3,060,000 km, which is option D.

So I think the intended answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame, considering time dilation due to the high velocity of the ejecta. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Relative Velocity and Time Dilation**:  
   The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, with the ejecta moving at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) relative to the Galaxy. Time dilation occurs because the ejecta's clock runs slower in the Galaxy's frame. The time dilation factor is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   In the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass (\( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \)). In the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer due to time dilation:  
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is the product of its velocity and the time in the Galaxy's frame:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,846 \, \text{km}
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance (\( \approx 3,061,846 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option D (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the problem setup.

Thus, the best answer is:

**Answer: D**
