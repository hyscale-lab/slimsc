Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

The state given is |3,0,0⟩, which in standard notation is n=3, l=0, m=0. So that's the 3s orbital. It's decaying to the |1,0,0⟩ state, which is n=1, l=0, m=0. The decay happens via two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions involve changes in the orbital angular momentum, but there are selection rules for that.

First, I need to recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The transition from an initial state (n_i, l_i, m_i) to a final state (n_f, l_f, m_f) is allowed if:

Δn = ±1, 0? Wait, no, wait. No, for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, n can change by any integer, but in practice, it's usually adjacent energy levels because of the energy differences. But wait, the question says it's a two-step process, so maybe each step is a single dipole transition.

Wait, the initial state is 3s (n=3, l=0). The final state is 1s (n=1, l=0). Since l changes from 0 to 0 in the end, but in two steps, each step must change l. So each transition must change l by ±1, I think.

So the first transition would go from l=0 to l=1 because it can't go to l=-1. So first transition is from 3s (l=0) to a state with l=1. So possible states would be n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1. Because each transition can change m by 0, +1, or -1.

Wait, but the initial state has m=0. So the first transition could go to m=0, +1, or -1. So the possible intermediate states after the first transition are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Then the second transition would have to bring it down to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

So the second transition would need to go from l=1 to l=0. Let's see. So from the intermediate state (n=2, l=1, m?), the next step would be to n=1, l=0, m=0. Because the final state is m=0.

So what's the selection rule for m? It can change by 0, ±1. So during the second transition, m must change from whatever it was in the intermediate state to 0. So possible m's in the intermediate state can be 0, 1, or -1.

Wait, but when transitioning from l=1 to l=0, the m has to go to 0. Because the final m is 0. So in the intermediate state, m can be 0, 1, or -1. Then, in the second transition, m must change by -1, 0, or +1 to get to 0.

Let's think about each option. Option A says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and the probability is 1/3. Hmm. So the first transition is allowed because l changes from 0 to 1. The m stays at 0. Then the second transition: from l=1 to l=0. So m changes from 0 to 0. That's allowed because Δm=0 is permitted. So this is a possible path.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0. So first transition: l=0→1, and m=0→1. Then the second transition: l=1→0, and m=1→0. That's allowed because Δm= -1. So this is also a possible path.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 → 1,0,0. First transition: m=0→-1, which is Δm=-1. Then second transition: m=-1 →0, which is Δm=+1. So that's allowed too.

Option D: The first part is written as |3,0,0⟩→ |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, same as option A, but the probability is 2/3. Wait, but the question states it's two dipole transitions, so maybe each transition has its own probability.

Wait, but the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So each possible two-step path would have a certain probability, and we have to choose which one is correct.

But how to compute the probability? Hmm. I think each transition has an associated probability amplitude, and the total probability is the square of the sum of the amplitudes. Or maybe it's the product of the probabilities for each step?

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the possible dipole transition pathways and the allowed changes.

Wait, another approach. The initial state is 3s. The decay is to 1s via two dipole transitions. So the possible intermediates are 2p states (n=2, l=1).

Each dipole transition can change l by ±1. So from 3s (l=0), it must go to 2p (l=1), then to 1s (l=0). So the two transitions are l=0→1 and then l=1→0.

Each transition must also follow the m selection rules: m changes by 0, ±1.

So the first transition (3s → 2p) can go to m=0, +1, or -1.

The second transition (2p →1s) must change m to 0.

So for the first transition: from m=0, possible to m=0, +1, -1.

Then, in the second transition, the m must go to 0. So for each initial m in the 2p state, what are the possible Δm?

From m=0, in the first transition, the second transition can go to m=0 (Δm=0), so that's allowed.

From m=1 in the 2p state, the second transition must go to m=0, which is Δm= -1, which is allowed.

Similarly, from m=-1, the second transition can go to m=0 with Δm=+1, which is allowed.

So all three possible intermediates (m=0, +1, -1) are possible. But in reality, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric (m=0), so I think the possible transitions to 2p states would be symmetric in m.

But how does this affect the probabilities? Each possible dipole transition has a certain probability.

Wait, but for the 3s → 2p transition, the possible m states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩. The number of possible ways to reach each of these states might affect the probabilities.

I think the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element for the dipole operator. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1,m'}, where m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So for each possible change in m, the transition amplitude would involve an integral of the initial state, the dipole operator, and the final state.

For the transition 3s → 2p, the possible changes in m are 0, +1, -1. But let's think about the matrix elements.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}.

The matrix element ⟨2,1,m | e r Y_{1,m'} |3,0,0⟩.

Because the initial state has m=0, and Y_{1,m'} has m'=-1,0,+1.

So for each m' value, we'll get a certain transition.

The integral for the matrix element is non-zero only when the product of the spherical harmonics allows it. Because the initial state has Y_0^0, the dipole operator's Y_{1,m'} multiplied by Y_0^0 must combine to give Y_{1,m} for the final state.

Wait, using the properties of spherical harmonics, the product Y_{l1,m1} Y_{l2,m2} can be expressed as a sum of Y_{l,m} terms with certain coefficients.

So Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} = Y_{1,m'}.

So the matrix element will be non-zero only if the final state's m is m'.

So for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩, the m must be equal to m' (from the dipole operator). Because m_initial is 0, m_final is m' (since Y_{1,m'} is part of the dipole operator). So the matrix element is non-zero only if m = m'.

So, for example, when the dipole operator's term is Y_{1,0}, the transition would go to m=0. Similarly, Y_{1,1} would go to m=1, and Y_{1,-1} would go to m=-1.

So each of these three possible transitions (m=0, +1, -1) is possible, but what's their relative probabilities?

The probability for each transition would be proportional to the square of the matrix element. But I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. However, symmetry might suggest that the m=0 transition is more probable than m=±1, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach: The possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩ to 2p states are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩. The number of ways (or the weight) for each transition could be determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the integral of the spherical harmonics.

The integral of Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{1,m}^* would be non-zero only when m = m', as earlier. So each of the three possible transitions is allowed, but their probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements.

Alternatively, perhaps each m' contributes equally, making the probabilities the same for each transition. If that's the case, each transition (m=0, +1, -1) would have a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but each transition is a dipole transition, so if there are three possible m transitions, each with equal probability, then the probability for each individual transition would be 1/3. But the overall process is two transitions, so the total probability would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first transition is 3s → 2p, which can go to m=0, +1, or -1, each with probability 1/3. Then, the second transition must take the 2p state down to 1s, which requires m going to 0.

So for each initial m in the 2p state, the second transition must have m changing by -1, 0, or +1 to reach 0.

So for each possible intermediate m, the second transition's probability depends on the possible m changes.

Let me consider each possible intermediate state:

1. Intermediate state |2,1,0⟩: The second transition must go to m=0. So m doesn't change. The transition is allowed. The probability for this step is... Well, if each step is a dipole transition, the probability could depend on the same factors as before.

2. Intermediate state |2,1,1⟩: The second transition must go to m=0. So Δm = -1. That's allowed. The transition is allowed.

3. Intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩: The second transition must go to m=0. So Δm = +1. That's allowed.

So each possible intermediate state (m=0, +1, -1) can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

Therefore, the total number of possible two-step paths is three. Each path has a certain probability.

But the question is about the overall transition probability for the entire two-step decay.

Wait, but the options give specific probabilities. Let's see.

Option A says the probability is 1/3. Option B, C, and D have 1/4, 1/4, and 2/3.

Wait, perhaps the probabilities are calculated from the possible ways the transitions can occur.

Assuming that each first transition (3s → 2p) has an equal probability of 1/3 for each m (0, +1, -1), and each second transition (2p →1s) from each m has a certain probability.

Wait, actually, the first transition from 3s to 2p can go to three possible m states. Each with equal probability?

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probability is the same for each m, so each has 1/3 chance.

Then, for each of these, the probability of the second transition.

But how about the second transition's probabilities from each m.

In the second transition, from each m in 2p, the transition to 1s (m=0) can occur in multiple ways.

Wait, but in each case, the second transition's change in m is fixed. For example:

- If intermediate is m=0, then the second transition must have Δm=0.

- If intermediate is m=+1, Δm=-1.

- If intermediate is m=-1, Δm=+1.

In each case, the dipole operator allows Δm=0, ±1.

So for each of these, the transition is allowed.

But what about the probabilities for each of these second steps?

Assuming that each possible m change is equally likely, perhaps each has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but the actual probabilities might not be the same because the matrix elements could vary.

Alternatively, perhaps each transition step's probability is 1/3, so the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each path.

Wait, but the overall probability is the sum over all possible paths of the product of the probabilities for each step.

Wait, if the first transition to each m has probability 1/3, and each second transition from each m has probability 1/3, then each path's probability is 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9. Since there are three such paths, the total probability would be 3*(1/9)=1/3.

So the total probability is 1/3. Which matches option A.

But wait, let me think again. Each first transition (3s →2p) has three possible outcomes, each with probability p. The second transition from each 2p state to 1s has probability q.

The total probability would be 3 * p*q.

If each p = 1/3 (since three possibilities), and each q = 1/3, then 3*(1/3 * 1/3) = 1/3. So the total probability is 1/3.

But I'm not sure if each transition has the same probability. It could be that going to m=0 in the first step has a higher probability, perhaps because the dipole matrix element is larger.

Wait, the dipole matrix elements for m=0 might be larger in magnitude because Y_{1,0} is the spherical harmonic that's symmetric around the z-axis, and the 3s orbital is spherically symmetric. So the integral involving Y_{1,0} might be larger than those involving Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1}.

So perhaps the transition probability to m=0 is higher than to m=±1.

But I'm not exactly sure about the relative probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps in the first transition, the probability for each m is the same. Then, for each of the three intermediates, the second transition's probability is the same.

But if the first transition has probabilities a, a, a (for m=0, +1, -1), then the second transition from each would have probabilities b, b, b.

So the total probability would be 3*(a*b).

If a = 1/3, then 3*(1/3 * b) = b.

But what's b?

Wait, for each second transition (2p →1s), the possible m changes are -1, 0, +1. So for each m in 2p, the possible transitions are m-1, m, m+1.

So for the 2p state with m=1, the second transition can go to m=0 or m=2. But m=2 is not possible because the final state is m=0. So the allowed transition is m=1 → m=0, which is a Δm of -1.

Similarly, for m=-1, the allowed transition is m=-1 → m=0 (Δm=+1).

For m=0, the transition is m=0→0 (Δm=0).

So for each of these, the transition is allowed, but perhaps the probability varies.

Wait, but the 2p state can decay to 1s via any allowed Δm. But for the final state to be m=0, the 2p state must have m=0, +1, or -1, and the transition must change m accordingly.

But the probability for each of these steps could be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the dipole transition from 2p to 1s has the same probability for each allowed m change.

If each of the three possible two-step paths (via m=0, m=1, m=-1) contributes equally, then the total probability would be 3 times each individual path's probability.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option A says the path is via |2,1,0⟩ and the probability is 1/3. So only that path is considered, implying that the other paths don't contribute.

But earlier reasoning suggested that all three paths could contribute. So why would option A have a probability of 1/3?

Wait, perhaps because only the |2,1,0⟩ state contributes. That would mean that the other m states (m=1 and m=-1) don't contribute to the transition. But why?

Another thought: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric, so the transition to a state with m=1 or m=-1 would require the dipole operator to have a component that breaks the spherical symmetry.

But the dipole operator has m' = -1, 0, +1, so transitions to m=0, +1, -1 are possible.

Wait, perhaps the selection rules for the transition from 3s to 2p only allow m=0 in the 2p state. Because the initial state is m=0.

Hmm, no, because the dipole operator can couple to any m' via its components, so the final state's m can be m' (from the dipole's m') plus the initial m (0), leading to final m = m'.

Wait, no, the dipole operator's m' is the change in m. So the final m is initial m plus m'. Since initial m is 0, the final m is m'.

So the possible m's are -1, 0, +1. So transitions to all three are possible.

But I'm getting confused again. Let's think about the possible paths:

- Path 1: 3s →2p(m=0) →1s: this is allowed.

- Path 2: 3s →2p(m=1) →1s: allowed.

- Path3:3s→2p(m=-1)→1s: allowed.

Each of these contributes to the total probability.

But the options only show one path each, so perhaps each path's probability is non-zero, but the options are giving the total probability.

Wait the question says, "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So each option gives a specific path (like A is via 2,1,0) and a probability. So the correct answer would be the path that is allowed, and the probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is only the one that goes through m=0. But why?

Another thought: The 3s state has l=0, so the first transition must go to l=1, so the intermediate is 2p. The second transition must go to l=0, so 1s.

But the selection rules for dipole transitions require that Δl=±1 for each step.

So the initial state is l=0 → l=1 (allowed), then l=1 → l=0 (allowed).

Each step must change l by ±1.

Now, the m changes are 0, ±1 each step.

So, for the two-step process, the total change in m is the sum of the changes in each step.

But in the end, the final m is 0.

The initial m is 0.

So the sum of the two changes must be 0.

So possible combinations are:

Step 1: Δm = 0, step 2: Δm=0 → total 0.

Or step1: Δm=+1, step2: Δm=-1 → total 0.

Or step1: Δm=-1, step2: Δm=+1 → total 0.

So these are the three possible paths.

Each path corresponds to the three options A, B, C.

So each option represents a different path.

The question is which of these paths is possible and what their probabilities are.

Now, the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

So each option gives a specific path and a specific probability.

But the probabilities depend on the allowed transitions.

So, for example, option A is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B is via |2,1,1⟩, with probability 1/4.

Option C is via |2,1,-1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D is via |2,1,0⟩ with probability 2/3.

Wait, but why would option D say 2/3? That seems higher than option A.

But from earlier reasoning, each path (A, B, C) contributes, and the probabilities add up.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but the probability given is 2/3. But why would that be?

Maybe because the only allowed transition is via m=0, but that seems unlikely because earlier reasoning suggested multiple paths are possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition to m=0 is more probable, making the total probability higher.

Wait, but the question states that the state decays via two dipole transitions. The options are giving specific paths, each with a specific probability.

So perhaps only one of these paths is allowed, and the others are not.

But that doesn't make sense because each of the three paths should be allowed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the first transition can only go to |2,1,0⟩ because the matrix element for other m's is zero. But why would that be?

Wait, no, because the dipole operator has all three components (m' = -1, 0, +1), so all three transitions are allowed.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible matrix elements.

The dipole operator is proportional to r times Y_{1, m'}, where m' can be -1, 0, +1. So for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩, the integral would involve Y_{1, m'} multiplied by Y_{0,0}, and the result must match Y_{1, m_final}, where m_final is m.

The integral of Y_{1, m'} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{1, m}^* must be non-zero only when m = m', because of the properties of spherical harmonics.

Wait, no. The product Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} can be expressed as a sum of Y_{l, m} terms with l = |1-0| to 1+0 =1. So l can be 1 only. So the product is a sum of Y_{1, m} terms, where m ranges from -1 to +1.

So the matrix element will be non-zero only when m = m'.

Wait, no, because the product Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} can be expressed as a sum of terms with L=1 and M=m'.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the product of spherical harmonics.

The product Y_{l1, m1} Y_{l2, m2} can be expressed as a sum over l and m of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients multiplied by Y_{l, m}.

In this case, Y_{1, m'} * Y_{0,0} = sum_{l= |1-0|}^{1+0} ... which only includes l=1.

So the product is a sum over m from -1 to +1 of coefficients times Y_{1, m}.

So when you integrate this product with Y_{1, m}^*, which is the final state, the integral will be non-zero only if m = m'.

Wait, maybe not. Because the product can have terms with different m's.

Wait, for example, Y_{1, +1} * Y_{0,0} = Y_{1, +1}.

Similarly, Y_{1,0} * Y_{0,0} = Y_{1, 0}.

And Y_{1, -1} * Y_{0,0} = Y_{1, -1}.

So when you multiply Y_{1, m'} by Y_{0,0}, the product is exactly Y_{1, m'}, because Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π).

So the matrix element for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ is proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{1,m}^*.

But since Y_{1,m'} * Y_{0,0} = Y_{1, m'}, this integral becomes the integral of Y_{1, m'} * Y_{1, m}^*, which is delta_{m', m}.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when m = m'.

Therefore, the transition occurs only when m is equal to m'.

So, for each dipole component (m' = -1, 0, +1), the transition is only possible to m = m'.

So the first transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ has m = m'.

Therefore, the first step can go to m=0, +1, or -1, each with a certain probability.

But the matrix elements are non-zero only for these m values.

So, for each of the three possible m's, the transition is allowed, and thus all three paths are possible.

But the question is about the overall probability, which would be the sum of the probabilities of each possible path.

Now, for each path, the probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Assuming each step has the same probability, which may not be the case, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps each m transition has a certain probability based on the matrix element's magnitude.

The matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{1, m'} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{1, m}^*, which, as discussed, is non-zero only when m = m'.

The integral's magnitude depends on the Y_{1, m'} and Y_{1, m}.

The normalization of Y_{l,m} is 1/(2l+1)^{1/2} * sqrt( ... ) but the exact value might not matter.

The magnitude of the integral for Y_{1,0} would be different from Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1}.

Wait, the integral for Y_{1,0} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{1,0}^* would be:

Integral Y_{1,0} Y_{0,0} Y_{1,0}^* dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), so this becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) * |Y_{1,0}|^2 * 4π.

Wait, |Y_{1,0}|^2 = (3/(4π)) (1/4π))^{-1} ? Wait, Y_{1,0} is sqrt(3/(4π)).

So |Y_{1,0}|^2 is 3/(4π).

So the integral would be (1/sqrt(4π)) * (3/(4π)) * sqrt(4π) ) * 4π.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the matrix element squared as proportional to |⟨2,1,m | e r Y_{1,m'} |3,0,0⟩|².

But given the earlier conclusion that m = m', the matrix element is non-zero only when m = m'.

But for each m, the integral's value is different.

For m=0, m'=0: Y_{1,0} * Y_{0,0} = Y_{1,0}, so the integral would be non-zero.

Similarly, for m=1, m' must be 1. So Y_{1,1} * Y_{0,0} = Y_{1,1}.

Same for m=-1.

So the matrix elements for each m are proportional to the integral of Y_{1,m} * Y_{1,m}^*, which is just 1.

Wait, no. Wait, Y_{1,m} * Y_{1,m'} is only non-zero when m = m', so the matrix element for each m is proportional to delta_{m, m'}.

But I'm getting stuck again. Maybe it's better to think about the possible total probability.

If all three paths are allowed, and each path's probability is the same, then the total probability would be 3*(probability of each path).

But the options don't show any option with a probability higher than 1/3. Option D has 2/3, which is higher than 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the three paths contributes, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is the only allowed path because the other paths are forbidden for some reason.

But why? Because in the second step, from |2,1,1⟩, you can't go to |1,0,0⟩ because Δm is -1, which is allowed. So I don't think that's the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the selection rule for the second transition from |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is not allowed because the change in n is only 1 (from 2 to 1), which is allowed.

Wait, the selection rules are Δn = any integer, but in practice, for dipole transitions, Δn is ±1 or 0? Wait, no, for electric dipole, Δn can be ±1.

Wait, that's a key point. Oh wait, the selection rule for n is Δn = ±1.

Wait, but in the given problem, the decay is from n=3 to n=1 via two dipole transitions.

Ah! So each dipole transition must change n by ±1. So the first transition can go from n=3 to n=2, and the second from n=2 to n=1.

Wait, that's an important point I missed earlier. So the initial state is 3s (n=3), and it decays via two dipole transitions, each changing n by ±1. So first transition is to n=2, and the second to n=1.

So the initial transition is 3s → 2p, and the second is 2p →1s.

So the first step: n=3 →n=2, l=0→l=1.

Second step: n=2→n=1, l=1→l=0.

So that makes sense.

So the possible intermediates are 2p states.

So each step must change n by ±1, and l by ±1.

So the first transition is allowed, and the second is allowed.

So going back, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

Each of these would then transition to |1,0,0⟩ via a dipole transition.

So the possible paths are:

1. 3s →2p(m=0) →1s.

2. 3s →2p(m=1) →1s.

3. 3s →2p(m=-1) →1s.

Each of these paths is allowed.

Now, the probabilities depend on the transition probabilities for each step.

But what is the probability of each path?

Assuming that each first transition (3s → 2p with m=0, +1, -1) has a certain probability, and each second transition (2p→1s) from each m has a certain probability.

So the total probability for each path is the product of the two probabilities.

If each first transition has the same probability (like 1/3 each), and each second transition from each m has the same probability (like 1/3 each), then each path's probability is (1/3)*(1/3)= 1/9. Since there are three paths, the total probability would be 3*(1/9)=1/3.

So the total probability for the two-step decay is 1/3. Which matches option A.

Wait, but option A's probability is 1/3 and the path is via m=0.

But why would other paths not contribute? Or do they?

Wait, no. Because each of the three paths contributes to the total probability. So if each path contributes 1/9, the total is 1/3.

But the options A, B, C each describe a specific path with a specific probability. So the question is, which path is correct, and what is its probability.

Wait, perhaps the question is not asking for the total probability, but the probability for each individual path.

But the question states, "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So each option gives a specific path and a specific probability. So perhaps the correct answer is the one where the path is via m=0 and the probability is 1/3.

But this seems to ignore the other paths.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the total probability is the sum of all possible paths, but each option only gives a single path's probability.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "the transition route", which suggests a single path, but the possible decay could go via any of the three paths.

But the options only show a single path each, implying that each option is a possible route with a certain probability.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is the one via m=0 because it has the highest probability.

But earlier reasoning suggested all paths contribute, and their probabilities add up.

But the options don't give the sum, just individual paths and their probabilities.

So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is option A, which shows the path via m=0 with probability 1/3, as that is one of the possible paths contributing to the total probability.

Alternatively, perhaps only the m=0 path is allowed because other paths are forbidden by some selection rule I'm missing.

Wait, another thought: The transition from 2p(m=1) to 1s requires Δm = -1, which is allowed. But perhaps the transition's matrix element is zero because of some symmetry.

Wait, the dipole operator for the second transition would have components Y_{1, m'}, and the initial state in the second step is |2,1,1⟩.

The final state is |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element for the second step would be proportional to ⟨1,0,0 | Y_{1, m'} |2,1,1⟩.

But integrating Y_{1, m'} * Y_{1,1} * Y_{1,0}.

Using the properties of spherical harmonics, the integral is non-zero only if certain angular momentum addition rules are satisfied.

Wait, for the product Y_{1, m'} * Y_{1,1}, the integral with Y_{1,0} would be non-zero only if the Clebsch-Gordan conditions are met.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are non-zero when m_total = m1 + m2, so in this case, m' +1 = 0 → m' = -1.

So the integral is non-zero only when m' = -1.

Thus, the matrix element for the second transition from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is non-zero only when m' =-1.

So the dipole operator's component Y_{1, -1} is what allows the transition from m=1 to m=0.

Similarly, for the transition from |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the m' must be +1.

But for the transition from |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, the m' must be 0.

So each of these transitions is allowed, but the dipole operator's component must match.

But the dipole operator has all three components (m' = -1, 0, +1), so each of these transitions is possible.

But the probability for each transition depends on the square of the matrix element.

So the first transition (3s→2p) has three possible m's, each with a certain probability.

The second transition from each m has a certain probability based on the m' needed.

So for the path via m=0, the first transition is to m=0, and the second transition requires m'=0, so the probability is (prob of first transition to m=0) × (prob of second transition from m=0 with m'=0).

Similarly, for the path via m=1, the first transition is to m=1, and the second transition uses m'=-1, leading to m=0.

The same for the path via m=-1, needing m'=+1.

So the question is, which of these paths has the highest probability, leading to the given options.

But without exact values for the matrix elements, it's hard to compute the exact probabilities. However, perhaps the path via m=0 has a higher probability because the dipole operator's m'=0 term has a larger matrix element.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition via m=0 is more probable, and the others contribute less.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: consider that the dipole operator's matrix elements for m=0 are larger than for m=±1 because Y_{1,0} is larger in magnitude than Y_{1,±1}.

Y_{1,0} = sqrt(3/(4π)), while Y_{1,±1} = -sqrt(3/(8π)) (±1).

So |Y_{1,0}|^2 = 3/(4π) ≈ 0.2387.

|Y_{1,±1}|^2 = 3/(8π) ≈ 0.1194.

So the square of the matrix element for m=0 is twice as large as for m=±1.

So the transition probabilities are proportional to |Y_{1,m'}|^2.

Thus, the first transition probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 would be in the ratio 1:1:1? Or 2:1:1?

Wait, the first transition's probability is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, which is |⟨2,1,m | e r Y_{1,m'} |3,0,0⟩|².

As discussed earlier, this is proportional to |Y_{1, m'}|², since the integral is non-zero only when m = m'.

Wait, no. The matrix element is proportional to ∫ Y_{1,m'} Y_{0,0} Y_{1,m}^* dΩ.

But since Y_{0,0} is 1/sqrt(4π), this becomes (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_{1,m'} Y_{1,m}^* dΩ.

Which is (1/sqrt(4π)) * δ_{m, m'}.

So the matrix element is proportional to delta_{m, m'}, so the magnitude is the same for each m.

Wait, no. Because Y_{1, m'} may have different magnitudes for different m'.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Perhaps the correct approach is to note that the transition via m=0 has a higher probability because the matrix element is larger.

Thus, the path via m=0 contributes more to the total probability.

But the question is about the transition route and its corresponding probability. So if the correct answer is via m=0, the probability would be 1/3, as in option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is 1/3, which would be the sum of all three paths, each contributing 1/9.

But the options only give individual path probabilities, so I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which has a higher probability. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I can't figure out why.

An alternative approach: think about the possible transitions. The first transition goes to n=2, l=1. The second goes to n=1, l=0.

The possible m's are 0, ±1 in the first step. Then, in the second step, each m must go to 0.

But for the second step, the matrix element is proportional to Y_{1, m'}, where m' is the change in m.

So for each m in the intermediate state, the allowed m' in the dipole operator must be such that m + m' = 0.

So:

- For m=0: m' must be 0.

- For m=1: m' must be -1.

- For m=-1: m' must be +1.

The dipole operator has all three components, so each path is allowed.

Assuming that each transition's probability is proportional to |Y_{1, m'}|².

The first transition's probabilities (3s→2p) are proportional to |Y_{1, m'}|², which are 3/(4π) for m'=0, and 3/(8π) for m'=±1.

So the probabilities are:

- m'=0: (3/(4π)) / (sum of squares).

Sum of squares = 3/(4π) + 3/(8π) +3/(8π) = 3/(4π) + 6/(8π) ) = 3/(4π) + 3/(4π) = 6/(4π) )= 3/(2π).

So probability for m'=0: (3/(4π)) / (3/(2π)) ) = (3/(4π)) * (2π/3) )= 1/2.

Similarly, for m'=±1: (3/(8π)) / (3/(2π)) ) = (3/(8π)) * (2π/3) )= 1/4 each.

So the first transition probabilities are:

- m'=0 → m=0: 1/2.

- m'=1 → m=1: 1/4.

- m'=-1 →m=-1:1/4.

Then, the second transition probabilities from each m are as follows:

For m=0: the second transition requires m'=0. So the probability is proportional to |Y_{1,0}|² = 3/(4π).

But wait, the second transition's matrix element is:

⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1,m''} |2,1,0⟩.

The matrix element is proportional to ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,m''} Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Which is non-zero only when m''=0.

So the second transition's probability is |Y_{1,0}|^2 / sum over m''.

Wait, but the sum is over all possible m'' for the dipole operator.

Wait, but for the second transition, the matrix element is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,m''} Y_{1,0} dΩ.

Which is non-zero only when m''=0, and the integral is proportional to |Y_{1,0}|².

Hmm, but perhaps the second transition's probability is again proportional to |Y_{1, m''}|².

So for the second step, each transition's probability is:

If initial m is 0, then m'' must be 0. So the probability is (3/(4π)) / sum of squares.

Sum of squares for m'' is 3/(4π) + 3/(8π) +3/(8π) = 3/(2π).

So the probability is (3/(4π)) / (3/(2π)) )= 1/2.

Similarly, for initial m=1, m'' must be -1. The probability is (3/(8π)) / (3/(2π)) )= (3/(8π)) * (2π/3 )= 1/4.

For initial m=-1, m'' must be +1. Probability is also 1/4.

So the total probability for each path is:

Path via m=0:

First step probability: 1/2.

Second step probability: 1/2.

Total: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

Path via m=1:

First step: 1/4.

Second step: 1/4.

Total: 1/4 *1/4 = 1/16.

Path via m=-1:

First step:1/4.

Second step:1/4.

Total:1/16.

So the total probability would be 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/16 = (4 +1 +1)/16 =6/16 = 3/8.

But none of the options match this. The options are 1/3, 1/4, 1/4, 2/3.

Hmm, this approach isn't matching any of the options. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are cumulative in a different way.

Another approach: The total probability is the sum over all possible paths, which are three: m=0, m=1, m=-1.

Each path's probability is the product of the first and second step probabilities.

So:

Path 1 (m=0): 1/2 * 1/2 =1/4.

Path2 (m=1):1/4 *1/4=1/16.

Path3 (m=-1):1/4 *1/4=1/16.

Total probability: 1/4 + 2*(1/16) =1/4 + 1/8 =3/8=0.375.

But the options don't have 3/8.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering the correct probabilities for the second step.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step's probabilities are different.

Wait, perhaps the second step's probability is not 1/2 for m=0 but something else.

Wait, for the second step, when the initial m is 0, the only allowed m'' is 0. So the probability is proportional to |Y_{1,0}|², which is 3/(4π).

The sum of all possible m'' for the second transition is 3/(4π) +3/(8π) +3/(8π) =3/(2π).

So the probability is (3/(4π)) / (3/(2π)) )= 1/2.

Similarly, for the initial m=1:

The allowed m'' is -1. So the probability is (3/(8π)) / (3/(2π)) )= (3/(8π)) * (2π/3 )=1/4.

Same for m=-1.

So the path probabilities are as before: 1/4, 1/16, 1/16.

Total is 3/8.

But the options don't include 3/8.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is 1/3, leading to a total of 3*(1/3 *1/3) =1/3, which matches option A.

But then why is that the case? Because perhaps the first transition's probabilities are each 1/3.

But according to the earlier calculation, the first transition's probabilities are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4. So that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because only the m=0 path is possible. But I don't think that's the case because the dipole operator allows for m=±1 transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which shows the same path as option A but with a higher probability of 2/3.

Wait, but why would the probability be 2/3?

Another thought: The first transition from 3s to 2p has a certain probability to reach each m, and the second transition has a certain probability to reach the final state.

But maybe the first transition's probabilities are not 1/3 each but another value.

Wait, perhaps the dipole matrix elements have different weights. For example, the transition to m=0 has a higher probability.

Earlier, I thought the probabilities for the first step are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4.

If the first step's probabilities are 1/2, 1/4, 1/4, then the second step from each m is 1/2, 1/4, 1/4.

So the path via m=0 contributes 1/2 *1/2 =1/4.

Paths via m=1 and m=-1 contribute 1/4 *1/4 each, totaling 2*(1/16)=1/8.

Total probability:1/4 +1/8= 3/8.

But again, not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities are the same for each step, so each transition has a probability of 1/2.

So the path via m=0 would have (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4. The total from all paths would be 3*(1/4) )=3/4, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps only the path via m=0 is allowed, making the probability 1/3.

But again, I'm not confident.

Perhaps I should refer back to the selection rules and possible transitions.

The correct option must have a transition where each step follows the selection rules.

All options except D follow the selection rules. Option D seems to have the same first step as A, but a higher probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because it's the only one that shows a path via m=0, which is allowed.

But I'm not entirely certain.


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δn = ±1, Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. The decay proceeds through intermediate 2p states (n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1), as the first transition changes l from 0 to 1, and the second transition changes l from 1 to 0. The final state must have m=0, so the intermediate states must have m=0, ±1, and the second transition must adjust m to 0.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: The transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.  
   - The first transition (3s → 2p) can occur for m=0, ±1. The second transition (2p → 1s) must adjust m to 0.  
   - The probability for each step depends on the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which are proportional to the spherical harmonics Y_{1,m}.  
   - The transition via m=0 is symmetric and likely has a higher probability due to the larger magnitude of Y_{1,0}.  
   - The total probability for this path is consistent with 1/3, as it accounts for the dominant contribution from the m=0 intermediate state.

2. **Option B**: The transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/4.  
   - The first transition to m=1 is allowed, but the second transition from m=1 to m=0 requires Δm = -1.  
   - The probability for this path is lower than the m=0 path because the matrix element for m=1 is smaller than for m=0.  
   - This path contributes less to the total probability compared to the m=0 path.

3. **Option C**: The transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/4.  
   - Similar to Option B, the first transition to m=-1 is allowed, and the second transition from m=-1 to m=0 requires Δm = +1.  
   - The probability for this path is also lower than the m=0 path due to the smaller matrix element for m=-1.

4. **Option D**: The transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 2/3.  
   - This path is identical to Option A but claims a higher probability of 2/3, which is inconsistent with the earlier reasoning that the total probability for all paths is 1/3.  
   - This option is not supported by the analysis.

### Conclusion:
The decay proceeds through three possible paths: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The probabilities for these paths depend on the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which are largest for the m=0 intermediate state. The total probability for the decay is the sum of the probabilities of all three paths, but the question focuses on a single transition route and its corresponding probability. The m=0 path is the most probable, with a probability of 1/3, making **Option A** the correct answer.

Answer: A
