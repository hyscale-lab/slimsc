Okay, so I have this question about ring-closing metathesis, and I need to figure out the starting material needed to synthesize a specific cyclohexene derivative. Hmm, ring-closing metathesis... I remember that Grubbs catalyst is involved in this kind of reaction. It's a process where alkenes undergo a redistribution of substituents, right?

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, let me draw that structure mentally. Cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents: at position 3 and 4, there are methyl groups, and at position 5, an isopropyl group. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, I think, because cyclohex-1-ene would have the double bond starting at position 1.

Ring-closing metathesis typically works by connecting two alkenes through a catalytic cycle. The catalyst breaks and reforms the double bonds. So the starting material would likely be a dieneâ€”a molecule with two double bonds or a single diene that can form a ring upon metathesis.

Wait, no, wait. Ring-closing metathesis usually involves a diene, but the mechanism is different. Oh wait, no, I think it's more about having two alkenes that can undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition in a way that forms a ring. Or is it that the metathesis connects two ends of a diene to form a ring?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the transition. During ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst (like Grubbs) will take two alkenes and swap their ends, effectively connecting the two ends to form a ring. So, the starting material must have two alkenes positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, they form the cyclohexene ring.

Let me think about the target structure again. The cyclohexene has a double bond at position 1. So the ring is six-membered. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So, in the ring, the substituents are on the ring atoms 3,4,5.

The starting material must be an octadiene. Because when you form a ring by closing, the chain would be an octene. For example, if the ring has 6 atoms, the chain must have 8 carbons? Wait, no. Let me think: if you have a 1,7-diene in an octene, when you close the ring, the distance between the two double bonds would determine the ring size. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try a different approach. In ring-closing metathesis, the starting material is typically a diene, and the metathesis forms a ring. The two alkenes that undergo metathesis are located at the ends of a chain. So the positions of these alkenes will determine the ring size. For a six-membered ring, the chain should have four carbons between the two double bonds. Because when the ends are connected, the chain forms a ring. Let me count: the two alkenes would be in a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2... Wait, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, think about the structure of the starting material. Let's imagine we have an octadiene. Suppose the starting molecule is an octa-diene with two double bonds at positions 1 and 7. Then, during metathesis, the catalyst would break and reform the double bonds, bringing the two ends together. So the structure would form a six-membered ring. Let's see: if the octa-1,7-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that's not right. Wait, octa-1,7-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, octa has 8 carbons. So 1,7-diene would have double bonds at positions 1 and 7. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but that would only be 8 carbons if it's 1 and 7 positions). Wait, for octa-1,7-diene: positions 1 and 7 are double bonds, but wait, that's not possible because in an 8-carbon chain, the positions are 1-2, 2-3, etc. So 1,7-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7, because octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let's number the carbons in the starting material. Suppose the starting material is an octadiene, so it's an 8-carbon chain with two double bonds. So, for an octa-1,7-diene, the first double bond is between C1 and C2, and the second is between C7 and C8. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2... Wait, but that would be 8 carbons, but the double bonds are at 1 and 7. So the chain is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's only 8 carbons. Wait, no, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8, but that would require at least 8 carbons, but that would mean the chain is 8 carbons long. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that's not right because the positions are 1-2 and 6-7. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octa-1,6-diene. So the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. Then, during metathesis, the ends (C1 and C6) would form the new double bond, creating a ring. Let me imagine that.

So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the correct structure. The target is cyclohexene, which is a 6-membered ring. So the starting material must have a chain that can form a 6-membered ring upon ring-closing metathesis. That means the chain must be long enough to form that ring.

Wait, the ring-closing metathesis brings two ends of a chain together to form a ring. So the chain must have a certain length, and the two alkenes must be at positions that, when they're connected, form a ring of the desired size. For a cyclohexene (6-membered ring), the chain should have four carbons between the two double bonds. So, the positions of the double bonds in the starting material should be spaced so that when they're connected, a 6-membered ring is formed.

In other words, the starting material should be a diene with two double bonds separated by four single bonds. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, that's not right.

Wait, let me think of the starting material as an octadiene, perhaps with double bonds at 1 and 6 positions. So the starting material would be octa-1,6-diene. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with double bonds at 1 and 6. Wait, no. Let me correct that. Octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right because that's only 8 carbons. Wait, maybe that's correct.

Wait, the idea is that the two double bonds are at positions that allow the formation of a six-membered ring. So, if you have a chain with two double bonds, say, ends at 1 and 6, then when you perform metathesis, the two ends (1 and 6) would connect, forming a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is an octa-1,7-diene. Because then, the distance between the two double bonds is 5 single bonds (positions 1-2 and 7-8). So when you perform metathesis, the ends (1 and 7) would form a connection, making a 6-membered ring.

Wait, let me count. Starting from position 1: the first double bond is 1-2, then positions 3,4,5,6,7,8. The second double bond is 7-8. So the chain is 8 carbons long. The distance between the two double bonds is 5 single bonds (positions 2 to 7). Wait, but that's 5 bonds, making a 6-membered ring when connected.

Wait, another approach: the number of carbons between the two double bonds will determine the ring size. So, if the starting material is 1,7-diene, the number of carbons between the two double bonds is 5 (positions 3,4,5,6,7). So when the metathesis occurs, the two ends (1 and 7) would form a ring. The ring would have 6 members because the number of carbons in the ring would be the sum of the two double bonds (each contributing two carbons) plus the carbons in between. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the ring size can be calculated as the sum of the positions. For example, if the two double bonds are at positions i and j, the ring size would be j - i + 1. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the ring size is determined by the number of atoms connecting the two ends. So, if the two alkenes are at ends 1 and 7, the number of atoms in the ring would be 7-1 + 1 (I think). Wait, that would make 7 atoms, which would be a 7-membered ring, but we need a 6-membered ring.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the target molecule. The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, in the ring, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

In the starting material, the substituents (isopropyl and methyl groups) should be present in positions that, after ring-closing, end up at 3,4,5.

So the starting material would have substituents that, when the ring forms, they end up at those positions.

Let me consider each option.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, octa is 8 carbons, so the structure would be:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The substituents: 5 is isopropyl, 3 and 4 are methyl. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH2)) ??? Wait, maybe it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, the starting material is octa-1,7-diene with substituents at 3,4,5. So the positions:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)-
4: CH(CH3)-
5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)) ? Wait, not sure.

Wait, another approach: during metathesis, the ends of the diene (the two alkenes) undergo a swap. So the substituents on the ends will end up on adjacent carbons in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the key is to imagine the starting material as a linear molecule with substituents, which upon metathesis forms a ring. The substituents in the starting material will end up at specific positions in the ring.

The target has substituents at 3,4,5. So the starting material must have substituents positioned so that when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4,5.

Let me consider the ring formation. Suppose the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at positions 3,4,5. The two double bonds are at positions 1 and 7. So when metathesis occurs, the double bonds are broken, and the ends are connected. The ring will have six members.

Imagine the starting material as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, that's probably not the right structure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2

I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider each option.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So the double bonds are at 2 and 6 positions. The substituents are at 3,4,5. So the chain would be 8 carbons. Let's see:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The structure would be CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH2)-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, because the double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. So between 2 and 3, and 6 and 7.

Wait, maybe during metathesis, the catalyst would connect the ends. But in this case, the two double bonds are in the middle, not at the ends. So perhaps this is not the right starting material.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So double bonds at positions 1 and 6. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, when metathesis occurs, the two ends (1 and 6) would form the ring. So the ring would be formed by connecting the first and sixth carbons.

Wait, in terms of ring size, that would form a 6-membered ring because the two ends are 5 carbons apart? Let me count. The starting material is octa-1,6-diene. So the chain is 8 carbons long. The two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. The number of atoms between the two double bonds is 5: positions 3,4,5,6,7? Wait, no, between 1-2 and 6-7, the number of single bonds is (6-2) =4, so the distance is four carbons apart.

So when the catalyst causes the metathesis, the two ends (1 and 6) would form the new bond. That would create a ring. The number of atoms in the ring would be 6? Because 1 is connected to 6, and the chain between is 5 carbons (positions 2 to 6). Wait, maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, if the starting material has double bonds at 1 and 6, the ring formed would have six members. Let me imagine connecting the first and sixth carbons. So the ring would be formed as positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. Thus, a six-membered ring. So substituents on positions 3,4,5 would remain in those positions. So, the starting material would have substituents at 3,4,5, which would end up at 3,4,5 in the ring. That seems to match the target.

Alternatively, option B has double bonds at 2 and 6. So the substituents would be in the middle, perhaps leading to substituents at positions 2,3,4 in the ring? Not sure.

Wait, another way: when the metathesis occurs, the substituents from the ends of the diene become adjacent in the ring. So, the substituents that were on the ends (positions 1 and 6) would become adjacent in the ring. Wait, but in the target, the substituents are at 3,4,5. So perhaps the substituents in the starting material would be in positions that, upon ring formation, end up at 3,4,5.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an octa-1,7-diene, which upon metathesis forms a six-membered ring. Let me think: if the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene, then the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. When the metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) are connected, forming a ring. The substituents would then be at positions 3,4,5 of the ring. That would match the target.

So, in this case, the starting material would be option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexene. So the substituents are on the ring. The starting material is a diene, so it's a linear molecule. When the metathesis occurs, the two ends (the alkenes) are connected.

If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. When the 1 and 7 positions are connected, those substituents become part of the ring. So in the ring, the substituents would be at positions that are three in from the connection points.

Wait, maybe the ring would have substituents in the middle. Let me imagine the starting material as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)) - CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's nine carbons. Wait, no. The starting material is octa, so 8 carbons.

So, octa-1,7-diene is 8 carbons. So the structure is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8.

Substituents: 5-isopropyl, 3 and 4 methyl.

So, positions 3 and 4: CH(CH3). Position 5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)).

So when the metathesis occurs, the 1 and 7 positions are connected. The ring formed will have 6 members.

So, the substituents at positions 3,4,5 are in the middle of the chain, which, upon ring formation, become positions 3,4,5 in the ring. That matches the target.

Thus, the correct starting material is option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the reaction mechanism and the structure of the target molecule. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of substituents between two alkenes, forming a ring. The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with methyl groups at positions 3 and 4, and an isopropyl group at position 5.

The starting material must be a linear diene with substituents positioned such that, upon metathesis, they form the cyclohexene ring with the correct substituent positions. The key is to identify the diene where the double bonds are spaced appropriately to form a six-membered ring and where the substituents align with the target structure.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. During metathesis, the double bonds at positions 1 and 7 are cleaved and reconnected, forming a six-membered ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 remain in place, matching the target structure. This is a valid starting material.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7. The substituents are at positions 3, 4, and 5. However, the double bonds are not positioned at the ends of the chain, so they cannot undergo ring-closing metathesis to form a six-membered ring. This option is invalid.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. While the double bonds are positioned to form a six-membered ring, the substituent at position 5 would not align correctly with the target structure after metathesis. This option is invalid.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, but the substituents are at positions 4, 5, and 6. These substituents would not align correctly with the target structure after metathesis. This option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The only starting material that can form the target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, via ring-closing metathesis is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**.
