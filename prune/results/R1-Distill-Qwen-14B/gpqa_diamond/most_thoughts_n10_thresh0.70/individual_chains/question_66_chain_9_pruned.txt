Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to work this out.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I should remember what each of these symmetries means.

Lorentz symmetry is the principle that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in different inertial frames. This includes rotations and boosts. So in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the physics doesn't depend on how you're moving relative to the system.

Poincare symmetry is a bigger symmetry group. It includes Lorentz transformations as well as translations in space and time. So if a theory respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry because Lorentz is part of Poincare. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is required, then Lorentz would be as well. But wait, in the SMEFT, do they need to respect Poincare?

Wait, the SMEFT is an effective field theory. EFTs generally have a certain degree of symmetry. The Standard Model (SM) has the gauge symmetry, and the EFTs are built by adding higher-dimensional operators that respect the SM symmetries. But about the spacetime symmetries, like Lorentz and Poincare.

I think that all operators in the SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the SM. The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so SMEFT operators should preserve Lorentz symmetry. Poincare is more about translations. The SM is Poincare-invariant because it's a relativistic theory, and I think the SMEFT maintains this as well. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their dimension, and they should all transform correctly under the symmetries of the SM, which includes Poincare.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries all SMEFT operators must respect. So all operators must transform correctly under these symmetries.

Wait, let me think again. The SMEFT is built by adding operators to the SM Lagrangian, but all terms must have the same symmetries as the SM. The SM is Poincare-invariant. So the SMEFT must also
