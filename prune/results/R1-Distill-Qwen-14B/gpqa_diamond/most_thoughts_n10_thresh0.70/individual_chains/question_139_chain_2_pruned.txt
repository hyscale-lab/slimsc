Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about two compounds, A and B, being treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment leads to the production of two different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B were originally.

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are often involved in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. But wait, these are being treated with aqueous conditions, not just nitrous acid. Oh right, maybe it's about the formation of carbocations or something else. Wait, another thought: when you have a compound that can form a carbocation upon treatment with nitrous acid and HCl, perhaps a ring expansion or some rearrangement happens.

Oh wait, I think this is about the formation of cyclic carbocations. So when a compound like a diol (specifically, a 1,2-diol) is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) in HCl and water, it can lead to the formation of a cyclic intermediate, which then rearranges. Oh right, the Robinson annulation or some kind of cyclization?

Wait, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. Another angle: the treatment can lead to the formation of a geminal diol, which then undergoes some kind of elimination or rearrangement. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the production of a diketone via the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, Baeyer-Villiger is usually with ketones and peracids leading to lactones or ketones. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The reagents are NaNO2, HCl, and water. Oh, wait! These are conditions for the production of N-nitrous compounds, but maybe in this context, it's more about the formation of a carbocation. For example, in the treatment of alcohols. Wait, if the starting material is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, maybe it can form a good carbocation upon protonation and loss of water.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a vicinal diol (1,2-diol) with nitrous acid can lead to the formation of a cyclic intermediate, such as a dioxolane, which upon decomposition forms a carbonyl group. Oh right! I think that's the case. So when a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol) is treated
