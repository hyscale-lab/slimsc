Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices in the case of spin-1/2 particles like the muon, which is a lepton. 

The problem says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The matrix S's first row is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, because the Pauli matrices are usually defined as sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Let me check: sigma_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]], right? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So S must be the sigma_y matrix. But wait, in this case, the matrix S is given as:

0  -i
i   0

Which is exactly sigma_y. So S is sigma_y. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * sigma_y.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are usually J = ħ/2 * sigma, where sigma are the Pauli matrices. Because for spin-1/2 particles, J is (ħ/2) sigma. The eigenvalues of J are ± ħ/2. 

Wait, so if Ay is c * sigma_y, and c is h/(4π), then let's compute the eigenvalues. The matrix Ay would be:

c * sigma_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

So sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1, because any Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So multiplying by a scalar c, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (+1) and c * (-1). So that's c and -c.

What's c? c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, the actual spin operator for each component is (ħ/2) sigma, so perhaps I should double-check the setup.

Wait, the
