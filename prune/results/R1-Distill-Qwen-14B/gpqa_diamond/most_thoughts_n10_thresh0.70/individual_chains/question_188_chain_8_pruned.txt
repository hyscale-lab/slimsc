Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all angles equal too. So all the a, b, c lattice parameters are the same, and in this case, each is 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees. The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... I think that's the d-spacing. Oh right, the formula for d-spacing in a crystal structure is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the lattice parameters multiplied by the Miller indices. No, wait, that's for cubic systems. Oh, right, but this is a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal? Or wait, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic? No, wait, rhombohedral isn't cubic because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So I think the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is a bit different.

The general formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is d = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + (2hk cosα)/(a²) + (2kl cosβ)/(a²) + (2lh cosγ)/(a²) )) ) Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, from what I remember, for a rhombohedral lattice, the formula is d = [ a^2 (1 - cos α) ]^(1/2) / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )) ? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should think again.

Wait, another approach. In a general orthorhombic system, the interplanar distance is given by the formula: 1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) + ... but wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are equal. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Another formula I recall is for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system: d_{hkl} = a / sqrt
