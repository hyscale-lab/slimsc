Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that was dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor product. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The 2D NOESY NMR of the major product shows a cross-peak, whereas the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

First, let me think about the initial steps. The starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons resonate, but since it's an anhydride, maybe it's an alpha proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure. Wait, 7 ppm is more in the aromatic or possibly an enol proton region. Hmm.

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is probably a carbonyl, like an anhydride or ester. 137 is probably a carbon with a double bond, maybe an sp2 carbon. Since the anhydride comes from a cis-alkene, perhaps the dehydration forms a cyclic anhydride.

Wait, when a diacid dehydrates, it can form a cyclic anhydride. If the starting alkene is cis, the resulting anhydride's structure would have the two carbonyl groups connected in a ring. So maybe it's a five-membered ring, like maleic anhydride. But the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. In maleic anhydride, the two alpha protons are equivalent, so they'd be a singlet. But wait, the starting acid was a cis-dicarboxylic acid, which would form a cis anhydride. Wait, no, when you dehydrate a cis diacid, you form a cyclic anhydride where the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons. So perhaps the structure is something like that.

Moving on. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a diene, right? It can undergo Diels-Alder reactions. The anhydride is an electron-deficient dienophile because it's an anhydride, so the reaction would form a six-member
