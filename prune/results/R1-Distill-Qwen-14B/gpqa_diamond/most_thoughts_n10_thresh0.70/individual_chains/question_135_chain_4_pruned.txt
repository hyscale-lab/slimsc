Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X based on a given Lagrangian. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, the problem states that the interaction Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh, right, the Lagrangian probably involves Yukawa-type interactions because it looks similar to Yukawa couplings where a scalar field (like X) interacts with fermions. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, I need to find out which fermions can be produced when X decays. The decay products have to satisfy energy and conservation laws, and they must be kinematically allowed. 

In particle physics, a boson like X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the rest mass of the fermion is less than half the mass of X. Because, you know, conservation of energy and all. So, the maximum mass of each fermion would be M_X / 2. Let me calculate that: 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Now, let's list out the known fermion masses. The quarks and leptons:

- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV (much less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way more, like ~173 GeV
- Leptons:
   - Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
   - Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
   - Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
   - Neutrinos are negligible, but they don't have significant mass, so they're probably not considered here.

Wait, wait. X is a boson, so when it decays, it can produce any fermion-antifermion pair where each fermion's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So, looking at the fermions:

For quarks:
- u, d, s, c are all below 3 GeV. Wait, c is 1.5 GeV, so definitely okay. But the bottom quark is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b and b-bar. Because 4.5*2=9 GeV, which is above X's mass (6 GeV), so that's impossible.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Because for the decay into a pair, each fermion needs to have mass less than M_X/2. So M_fermion <= 3 GeV. So the fermions that meet this are:

u, d, s, c, and the leptons e, μ, τ (since
