Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. They mention that the transition between two energy levels of Ti (titanium) corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet, I think.

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to recall how the ratio of populations in different energy levels depends on temperature. I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T)), where g are the statistical weights, E energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

Since the transition corresponds to a certain wavelength, 1448 Å, I can find the energy difference between the levels using the relation E = hc/λ. Oh wait, but since the ratio involves the exponential of (E2-E1)/(k T), maybe I can compute the ratio when the star is without spots and then when it has spots, then find the factor.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor we're looking for is (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots).

But first, let me outline the steps:

1. Compute the energy E for the transition using the given wavelength.
2. Use the energy to find the ratio of populations without and with spots.
3. Remember that the statistical weights (g factors) may not change, so they'll cancel out when taking the ratio.

Wait, but the ratio between level 1 and level 2 is n1/n2. Or which way? Let me think. If the transition is from level 2 to level 1, then the energy is E2 - E1. But for the Boltzmann factor, the higher energy level is level 2, so E2 > E1. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )^-1 ?

Wait, probably the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), but I need to get this right.

Wait, Boltzmann's equation: n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So, if we have two levels, i and j. Let's say level 1 is i, level 2 is j. Then, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because (E1 - E2) is negative since E2 > E1.

So, the ratio n1/n2 increases with temperature because higher T makes the exponential larger.

Wait, when T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes smaller, so the exponent is a smaller positive number. So, the exponential is larger (since e^x decreases as x decreases when x is positive). Wait, let me think. Suppose E2-E1 is positive, so when T increases, (E2-E1)/(kT) decreases. So the exponent becomes smaller, so e^(smaller) makes the value smaller? Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, e^{-something} gets smaller when something increases. Oh wait, in the ratio n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent gets smaller, so the exponential term becomes smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases. Wait, but wait, if E2>E1, and T is higher, the atoms have more thermal energy, so they're more likely to be in the higher energy level. So n2 increases relative to n1, making n1/n2 decrease. That makes sense.

So, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K). So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease because T went down. Which matches the problem statement: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.

We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Wait, no. Because the ratio without spots is higher than the ratio with spots. Because when the star is hotter (without spots), the ratio is higher.

So, the factor is (ratio without)/(ratio with) = [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ].

But let me think in terms of the formula. For each T, the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Since g1 and g2 are constants, the ratio of the two ratios would be exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

Simplify: exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Hmm, that's the factor by which the ratio increases or decreases.

But let's compute it step by step.

First, compute the energy difference E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ wavelength.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = ?

Let me compute that:

numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approx 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But wait, we might not need the actual value in J, since we'll work with E/(k) in terms of (E/(k)).

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, E/(k) = 1.372e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ (1.372/1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1.74 * 1e5 = 1.74e5 K.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.372 / 1.38 ) * 1e5.

1.372 / 1.38 ≈ 0.994 ≈ 0.994.

So E/(k) ≈ 0.994e5 K = 99,400 K.

Hmm, that's about 1e5 K.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again:

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25)/1.448e-7 = Let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ approx 1.372.

Then 1e-25 / 1e-7 = 1e-18.

So E ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

E/(k) = 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5.

1.372 /1.38 is approximately 0.994, so 0.994e5 = 99,400 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 99400 K.

But let me think about this. Because E is the energy per photon, and when we divide by k, which is per particle, it's in units of K.

Wait, but in terms of thermal energy, E/(k) is about 99,400 K.

So, for each temperature, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T) = (E/(k)) / T.

So, let's compute (E/(k)) / T for both T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

At T=6000 K: (99400) / 6000 ≈ 16.5667

At T=5500 K: 99400 / 5500 ≈ 18.0727

Wait, so the exponents are 16.5667 and 18.0727.

But wait, in our Boltzmann ratio, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T) which we just found as (E/k)/T.

So when T increases, the exponent decreases.

Now, for the ratio n1/n2, which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is (g1/g2) * exp( (E/k)/T )

So, the ratio without spots (T=6000) is (g1/g2) * exp(16.5667)

The ratio with spots (T=5500) is (g1/g2) * exp(18.0727)

The factor we're looking for is (without)/(with) = exp(16.5667) / exp(18.0727) ) = exp(16.5667 - 18.0727 ) = exp(-1.506)

Exp(-1.506) is approx e^(-1.5) is about 0.223. But let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, e^(-1.506) = 1 / e^(1.506)

e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is approx 4.4817, e^0.006 is about 1.006, so e^1.506 is about 4.4817 * 1.006 ≈ 4.510.

So 1/4.510 ≈ 0.2217.

So the factor is about 0.2217. Wait, but that can't be right because the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning (without)/(with) is greater than 1. Because when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, so the factor is (higher)/(lower) = greater than 1.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio in reverse. Oh wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2)*exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T is higher, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller. So exp(small number) is larger.

Wait, but in the case of higher T (6000 K), the exponent is 16.5667, which is a large number. E.g., e^16.5 is a huge number.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T) and E is fixed. So at T=6000, the exponent is 99,400 /6000 ≈16.5667. So that's (E2-E1)/(k T) = 16.5667.

Wait, but that's a very large exponent. The exponential of that would be enormous, but in reality, for a star's spectrum, the lines are formed when the exponent is manageable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check. Because E is in Joules, and k is in J/K, so E/(k) is in K. So, E/(k) = 99,400 K. So when T is 6000 K, E/(k T) is 99400 /6000 ≈16.5667. So the exponent is about 16.5.

But e^16.5 is a huge number, about 1e7. So that would make n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * e^16.5. So when the temperature is lower (5500 K), the exponent is higher, leading to a larger e^18.07, which would make (n1/n2) with spots be (g1/g2) * e^18.07.

Wait, but that can't be correct. Because when the temperature is lower, (n1/n2) is higher. Let me think: if E is fixed, then when T is lower, (E/(k T)) is higher. So the exponent is higher, so the exponential is higher, so the ratio n1/n2 is higher. So without spots, T is higher, so the exponent is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio would be higher than when it doesn't. But the problem says the opposite. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So maybe I have the ratio backwards.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Let me think again. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels is given. The transition corresponds to a wavelength, so it's the energy difference between the two levels. Suppose the transition is from level 2 to level 1 (so E2 > E1). Then, the number of atoms in level 2, n2, is proportional to (g2 / g1) exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T)) ), so n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Ah, perhaps I've been considering the wrong ratio. Because if the ratio is n2/n1, then when T increases, this ratio increases because the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term is smaller, so n2/n1 is smaller. Wait, no, let's see.

Wait, (E2-E1) is positive, so -(E2-E1) is negative.

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so -(that) becomes less negative. So exp( a less negative number ) is larger. So n2/n1 increases as T increases. So when T is higher (no spots), n2/n1 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So, without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if the ratio is n1/n2, then at lower T, this ratio is higher. Because n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when T is lower (spots present), the ratio is lower. That's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the way the ratio is presented. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1. Let me see.

If the ratio is n2/n1, then it is (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

At higher T (6000 K), (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so - that is a larger negative number, so exp is smaller. So n2/n1 is smaller at higher T. So when the star has spots (lower T), n2/n1 is larger.

But the problem says the ratio (presumably n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the ratio is n1/n2, but in that case, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases, which would conflict with the problem statement.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the ratio.

Wait, maybe the question is about the ratio of level 1 to level 2, n1/n2. So when the star has spots (lower T), this ratio is lower. That can't be, because according to the equation, when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so the exponential is larger, so n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this would imply that lower T leads to lower n1/n2. Which contradicts the equation.

Wait, perhaps the energy is from level 1 to level 2, meaning E is E1 - E2, which is negative. So E2-E1 is positive.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E is E2 - E1. But in the ratio n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So if T increases, the exponent is smaller, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So without spots, higher T gives lower n1/n2. So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is higher.

But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would mean the ratio is lower when T is lower. Which contradicts the equation.

Hmm, so perhaps the ratio is n2/n1.

Wait, let's think again. If the ratio is n2/n1, then when T is higher, this ratio is higher. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is lower. That matches the problem statement.

So perhaps the problem is talking about the ratio n2/n1.

Wait, but the question states: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". It doesn't specify which way. So perhaps the ratio is n1/n2, and the problem says it decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that without spots, the ratio is higher.

But according to the equation, n1/n2 increases when T decreases. So without spots (higher T), the ratio is lower. So when the star has spots, the ratio is higher.

But that contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the ratio is actually n2/n1. So the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, let me try this approach.

Assume that the ratio is n2/n1. Then, when T increases, n2/n1 increases because the exponent is exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential is higher. So, when T is higher (no spots), n2/n1 is higher.

So, when the star has spots, T is lower, n2/n1 is lower. So the ratio (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots. Which matches the problem statement.

So, the ratio we're considering is n2/n1.

So, the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k *5500) ) ]

The g's cancel, so it's exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) ( 1/(6000) - 1/(5500) ) ] )

Wait, no. Let me compute the expression correctly.

The ratio is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k * 5500) ) ) ]

Which is exp( [ - (E2-E1)/(k*6000) + (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ] )

Factor out (E2-E1)/(k):

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

So, compute the exponent.

We have (E2-E1)/(k) = 99,400 K, as computed earlier.

Compute [1/5500 - 1/6000]:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

Difference: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151

So, (E2-E1)/(k) * (0.000015151) = 99,400 * 0.000015151 ≈ let's compute that.

99,400 * 0.000015151 = ?

0.000015151 is 1.5151e-5.

So 99,400 * 1.5151e-5 = 99,400 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 99,400 * 0.000015151:

99,400 = 9.94e4.

Multiply by 1.5151e-5: 9.94e4 * 1.5151e-5 = (9.94 * 1.5151) * 1e-1.

9.94 * 1.5151 ≈ let's compute:

1.5151 * 10 is 15.151.

So 1.5151 *9.94 = 15.151 - (1.5151 * 0.06) ≈ 15.151 - 0.0909 ≈ 15.06.

So 15.06 * 0.1 = 1.506.

So the exponent is approximately 1.506.

So the factor is exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506 ≈ ?

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^0.006 is approximately 1.006.

So e^1.506 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006 ≈ 4.51.

So the factor is approximately 4.51. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so the answer would be C.

Wait, but let me make sure all the steps are correct.

Wait, the exponent came out to be ~1.506, so exp(1.506) is about 4.51. So the ratio (n2/n1)_no_spots is 4.51 times larger than (n2/n1)_spots. So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Energy Difference Between Levels**:  
   The energy difference between the two levels is calculated using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).  
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Dividing by the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the characteristic temperature is:  
   \[
   \frac{E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Boltzmann Distribution**:  
   The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
   \]  
   where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:  
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
   \]

3. **Substitute Values**:  
   Using \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), and \( \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]  
   The exponent becomes:  
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = 99,400 \times 0.0000151 \approx 1.506.
   \]  
   Therefore, the factor is:  
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.51.
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The ratio of \( n_2/n_1 \) increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has no spots compared to when it has spots.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio changes is **~4.5**, corresponding to **Option C**.

Answer: C
