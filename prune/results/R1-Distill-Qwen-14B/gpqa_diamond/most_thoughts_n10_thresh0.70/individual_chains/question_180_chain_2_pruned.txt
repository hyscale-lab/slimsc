Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is saying.

So, there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the potential energy between point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law. The formula for potential energy U between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, since there are multiple charges, I think I need to consider the potential energy between each pair of charges.

So, the system has 13 charges. One is fixed at point P (let's call this charge q), and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. But wait, each of those 12 is 2 meters away from P, but what about their distances from each other? Oh, right, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other might not be specified. Wait, maybe they're all at the same point 2 meters away from P, but since they're identical and the problem doesn't mention any other constraints, perhaps they are arranged symmetrically around P, but their mutual distances aren't given. Hmm, but when calculating potential energy, I have to consider every pair.

Wait, but wait a second. The potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, for each pair of charges, calculate the potential energy and sum them all.

But wait, let me think again. The setup: 12 charges are each 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So, the charge at P is fixed, and each of the 12 surrounding charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. But what about the distance between the surrounding charges themselves? If they're all at 2 meters from P, perhaps they're all on the surface of a sphere
