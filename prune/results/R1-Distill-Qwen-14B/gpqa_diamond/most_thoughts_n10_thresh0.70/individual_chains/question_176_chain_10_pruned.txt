Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about the probability of measuring specific outcomes for two observables, P and Q, in sequence. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the order of measurements matters because measuring one observable affects the state of the system for the next measurement.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a vector, so it should be a column vector. So, it's a 3x1 matrix. Right, because the operators P and Q are 3x3 matrices, so the state vector must be 3-dimensional.

The operator P has a matrix with the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, I'm not sure what the eigenvalues of P are, but maybe I can find them. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors because when you measure an observable, the state collapses to an eigenvector of the operator.

Operator Q has a diagonal matrix: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is diagonal, which means its eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1. The eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, I think. So the eigenvectors are |1> = (1,0,0), |0> = (0,1,0), and |-1> = (0,0,1).

Wait, no.
