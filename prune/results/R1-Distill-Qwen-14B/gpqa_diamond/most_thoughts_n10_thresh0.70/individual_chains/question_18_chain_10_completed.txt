Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

The given data includes the masses of the stars, but wait, the mass might not directly affect the elemental abundance ratios. Oh, right, because the problem mentions using the Equivalent Width (EW) method under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So maybe the mass isn't directly needed here; the problem is more about the abundance ratios.

Looking at the abundances provided:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, what do these brackets mean again? Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of element X to Y relative to the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log is -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

So the Sun has nFe = 10^-4.5 per H, nMg=10^-5 per H.

Now, let's tackle each star.

Starting with Star_1.

[Fe/H]_1 is 0. So the Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. So nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So the ratio of Fe is the same.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = 0.3 → nSi_1 /nFe_1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So nSi_1 = 2 * nFe_1.

But since nFe_1/nH_1 = same as Sun, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH_1 / nH_sun). Wait, but in the Sun, nH_sun is 1, so nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun) ? Or maybe I should think in terms of the same H density.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express all in terms of H. Let me think.

In Star 1, [Fe/H] is 0 → [Fe/H] = log(nFe_1 / nH_1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0 → So log(nFe_1 /nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun). So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But since nH_1 is the number of hydrogen atoms in Star_1, which is different from the Sun's. But for ratios like [Si/H], the H cancels out. Wait, but perhaps I don't need to know the absolute H; I can work with ratios relative to H.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let's express [X/H] for Star 1.

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so log(nFe_1 /nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun). So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) =0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 *10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun *nH_1) * 10^0.3.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the right way to go. Maybe I should express [Si/Fe] in terms of solar ratios.

Wait, [X/Fe] = [X/H] - [Fe/H], but since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 -0 = [Si/H]_1.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → which would mean log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) +0.3.

So nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *10^0.3.

So the ratio of Si to H in Star 1 is higher than the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Similarly, for Star 2.

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg_2 /nH_2) = log(nMg_sun /nH_sun). So nMg_2/nH_2 = same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) =0.3 → nMg_2 = nSi_2 *10^0.3.

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2.

So (nMg_sun /nH_sun)*nH_2 =nSi_2 *10^0.3.

So nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 / 10^0.3.

Hmm. So now I need to find the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = ?

Let me write expressions for nSi_1 and nSi_2.

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1 * 10^0.3.

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 ] / 10^0.3.

So the ratio is (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [ (nSi_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify the terms:

= [ (nSi_sun / nMg_sun ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) ] 

Because 10^0.3 / (1/10^0.3) )= 10^0.6.

So:

= (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

Wait, but I don't have nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach. What if I express everything in terms of the Sun's ratios?

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is given. Let me calculate that.

In the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nH)/(nSi/nH) → Wait,

Wait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for [Mg/Si] in the Sun, since [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, because it's the reference.

Wait, no. The [X/Y] values are relative to the Sun. So if [Mg/Si]_sun would be zero, but in reality, it's a positive number. Wait, no, the [Mg/Si]_sun is the value for the Sun, which is zero in this problem's context.

Wait, looking back, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

So nMg_sun/nH_sun =10^-5, nFe_sun/nH_sun=10^-4.5, nSi_sun/nH_sun is something we need to find.

Wait, but we don't have [Si/Fe]_sun given. Hmm, perhaps we can calculate it.

In the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is zero? Or not? Because for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, but the Sun's is the reference.

Wait, the [X/Y] notation is such that [X/Y]_sun is zero. So, in Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which is higher than the Sun. So in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero.

So for the Sun: [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) - 0 = log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) =0 → nSi_sun =nFe_sun.

Because 10^0=1 → nSi_sun =nFe_sun.

Wait, but wait: [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. For the Sun, log(nX/nY) equals log(nX/nY)_sun, so [X/Y]_sun is zero. So yeah, in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero. So for the Sun, nSi_sun =nFe_sun.

So, nSi_sun =nFe_sun.

Given that, in the Sun, nFe/nH =1e-4.5, so nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

Since nSi_sun =nFe_sun, nSi_sun =1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

So nSi_sun/nH_sun =1e-4.5.

But wait, nMg_sun/nH_sun is 1e-5.

So, back to the ratio:

(nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) = (1e-4.5) / (1e-5) )= 10^(-4.5 +5) )=10^0.5 ≈ 3.162.

So, (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) = sqrt(10) ≈3.162.

So, going back to the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) * (nH_1/nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

We have (nSi_sun /nMg_sun )=3.162.

10^0.6 is about 3.98 ≈4.

So the ratio is 3.162 * (nH_1 /nH_2) *4.

Wait, but I still don't know (nH_1 /nH_2). Hmm. How can I find that?

Wait, perhaps using the mass information. The masses are given as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but wait, how does the mass relate to the number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere?

Wait, the mass of a star is related to the number of particles. But in the photosphere, which is a thin layer, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms scales with the mass? Or perhaps the surface gravity affects the line formation, but under LTE, maybe the number of hydrogen atoms relates to the mass.

Wait, but maybe the number of hydrogen atoms per unit area (surface) is the same for both stars? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere depends on both the star's radius and surface gravity. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, in stellar atmospheres, the number density of atoms depends on pressure and temperature, but under LTE, the ionization and excitation states are determined by local conditions. However, when considering the number of atoms in the photosphere, the total number of hydrogen atoms would relate to the star's surface area and the scale height. But this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the relation between [Fe/H] and the metallicity.

Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of Fe to H relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe/H ratio is same as Sun. So, (nFe_1 /nH_1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 /nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Fe/H] is not given, but [Mg/H] is 0. So nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, but perhaps we can find (nH_1)/(nH_2) in terms of the masses.

Wait, the problem gives the masses as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses. But how does the mass relate to the number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere? Hmm, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere depends on the star's surface area and the scale height, which is related to the star's gravity and temperature.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the mass is a red herring here. Let me think again.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. So the ratio is (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

From earlier, I have:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2 ] / 10^0.3.

So the ratio is (nSi_1/nSi_2) = [ (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

Simplify:

= (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 )

= (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) * (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6.

We already found (nSi_sun /nMg_sun )=10^( [log(nSi/nH) - log(nMg/nH) ] )_sun.

Wait, in the Sun, nSi_sun/nH_sun =1e-4.5, nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

So (nSi/nMg)_sun = (1e-4.5)/(1e-5) )=10^0.5 = sqrt(10)≈3.162.

So that term is 3.162.

The 10^0.6 term is about 3.98.

So that gives 3.162 * (nH_1/nH_2) *3.98 ≈ (3.162 *3.98 ) * (nH_1/nH_2) → ~12.6 (since 3.162*3.98 ≈12.59).

So the ratio is 12.59 * (nH_1/nH_2).

But what is (nH_1/nH_2)?

Wait, nH is the number of hydrogen atoms per unit volume. But how does the number of H atoms in the photosphere relate to the star's mass?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the star's radius and surface gravity.

The number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere would be the surface area multiplied by the scale height times the number density of hydrogen.

The number density (nH) is given by (P)/(k*T), where P is pressure, k Boltzmann constant, T temperature.

But under LTE, the pressure and temperature vary, so this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps if the stars are main-sequence stars, the photospheric pressure and temperature can be approximated, but without knowing the exact parameters, perhaps we can make an assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen number density is the same for both stars. But I don't think that's given.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio (nH_1/nH_2) is equal to (M_1/M_2) because the number of H atoms is proportional to the mass, assuming similar compositions. But that might not be correct, because the mass includes all elements, not just H.

Wait, but if the [Fe/H] is zero for Star_1, that implies that the metallicity is same as Sun, but perhaps the H content is same? No, not exactly. Because [Fe/H] is about the Fe abundance relative to H.

Wait, [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, which means nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

But the total mass of the star is 1.5 solar masses. So the mass is higher, but the composition is similar.

Wait, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms is proportional to the mass times (nH / (nH + other nuclei)), but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere is proportional to the star's mass. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about it. The mass of the star is given, but the photosphere is a thin layer. The number of atoms in the photosphere would be approximately the surface area multiplied by the scale height.

Scale height H = kT/(mu m_p g), where mu is mean molecular weight, m_p proton mass, g surface gravity.

Surface area A =4 pi R^2.

So number of atoms in photosphere ≈ A * H =4 pi R^2 * H.

So, substituting H:

H = (kT)/(mu m_p g) → (kT)/(mu m_p (G M / R^2)) ) → (k T R^2)/(mu m_p G M )

Thus, A * H = 4 pi R^2 * (k T R^2)/(mu m_p G M ) )= 4 pi (R^4 T )/(mu m_p G M )

But without knowing R, T, mu, etc., it's hard to find the exact number.

But perhaps under the assumption that both stars have the same effective temperature and radius scaling with mass in a certain way. But without more info, maybe the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: since [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, and [Mg/H] for Star_2 is 0, that indicates that their overall metallicity (assuming Fe and Mg are tracers) is similar to the Sun.

But perhaps the key here is that [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, so the abundances are solar. But in Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so Si is enhanced. In Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3, so Mg is enhanced relative to Si.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the solar ratios and then compute the [Si/H] for each star.

In Star 1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → same Fe/H as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 =0 +0.3=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log(solar ratio) +0.3.

Similarly, for Star 2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/H]_2 = [Si/H]_2 +0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → 0 = [Si/H]_2 +0.3 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

[Si/H]_2= -0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2 =10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1 )/(nSi_2/nH_2 )= [10^0.3 /10^-0.3 ] =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

But wait, this ratio is (nSi_1 /nH_1 )/(nSi_2 /nH_2 )= (nSi_1 /nSi_2 ) * (nH_2 /nH_1 ).

So,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ] * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

= 3.98 * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

But wait, I don't know (nH_1 /nH_2 ). Hmm, this brings me back to where I was before.

So, I need another approach to find nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, another angle: The number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere of each star would be proportional to the product of the surface area and the scale height.

But without knowing R and T, perhaps we can find a relation using the mass.

Wait, the mass of the star is M = (nH * m_p ) * (volume ) + ... but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms in the star is roughly proportional to the star's mass divided by the mean molecular weight.

But if the stars have the same composition as the Sun, then their mean molecular weight μ is similar. So, N_H ≈ M / μ.

So, for Star_1, N_H1 ~ M_1 / μ.

Star_2, N_H2 ~ M_2 / μ.

Thus, N_H1 / N_H2 = M_1 / M_2 = 1.5 /1.2 =5/4 =1.25.

Wait, but that's the ratio of the total number of H atoms in each star. But the photosphere is a thin layer; perhaps the number of H atoms in the photosphere scales with the star's surface area.

Wait, or maybe the number of H atoms in the photosphere is proportional to the star's surface area multiplied by the scale height.

But without knowing the scale heights or surface areas, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the number of H atoms in the photosphere is the same as the total, which for main-sequence stars would be approximately proportional to their mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms in the photosphere scales with the star's mass. So N_H1 = M_1 * k, N_H2 = M_2 *k → N_H1 / N_H2 = M_1/M_2 =1.5/1.2=5/4=1.25.

But wait, if the stars have the same metallicity, then their H content would be the same fraction of their mass. So N_H1 = (M_1 / M_sun) * N_H_sun.

Similarly, N_H2 = (M_2 / M_sun) * N_H_sun.

Thus, N_H1/N_H2 = M_1/M_2 =1.5/1.2=5/4=1.25.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is correct, but let's proceed with this assumption.

So, if N_H1/N_H2=1.25,

Then the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) =3.98 * (nH_1/nH_2 )=3.98 *1.25 ≈4.975.

But the options given are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm, 4.975 is close to option A)3.9 but not exact. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume that nH_1/nH_2 is M_1/M_2. Maybe the (nH_1/nH_2) is (nH_1 /nH_2 ) = (M_1 / M_2 ) * (something). Or perhaps it's the same as (nH_sun) for both, but that would only be the case if their surface gravity is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms in the photosphere is the same for both stars, but that doesn't make sense given their different masses.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the stars have the same surface gravity, but that's unlikely since they have different masses and perhaps radii.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms in the photosphere is the same, but that seems arbitrary.

Wait, going back to the previous approach where (nSi_1/nSi_2)= 3.162 * (nH_1/nH_2) *3.98.

Wait, if I have to find (nH_1/nH_2), perhaps I can relate it using the given information about the masses and the elemental abundances.

Wait, perhaps the total number of elements in the star can be related to the mass. For example, the mass is the sum of the mass contributions from each element, each multiplied by their respective number of atoms.

But this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) involves (nH_1/nH_2), and we don't have information about the H content, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H content ratio is 1, i.e., nH_1 =nH_2.

But why would that be the case? Well, perhaps because both stars have the same metallicity, but that might not directly affect H.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the H ratio, considering that the ratio of Si is mainly determined by their [Si/H] values, and the H terms cancel out.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, for the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2 ) → if we express both in terms of the Sun's values and the [Si/H] for each star, without involving nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, since [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2 =10^-0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2 ) = [10^0.3/(10^-0.3)] * [nH_2/(nH_1)].

Which is 10^0.6 * (nH_2/nH_1 ) ≈3.98 * (nH_2/nH_1 ).

But without knowing (nH_2/nH_1 ), this doesn't help. So perhaps the problem expects us to assume that (nH_1/nH_2)=1.

But that would make the ratio 3.98, which is option A.

Wait, but the options have 3.9 as option A, which is close to 3.98. So perhaps the answer is A) ~3.9.

But I'm not entirely confident because I think I might be missing something about the H ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the stars affects the H content in a way that I should have considered.

Wait, earlier I thought about the number of H atoms being proportional to the star's mass. If that's the case, then N_H1 = M_1 *k, N_H2= M_2 *k.

But the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2 )= [ (nSi_1/nH_1 ) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) ] * (nH_1/nH_2 )

= [10^0.3 /10^-0.3 ] * (nH_1/nH_2 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

If nH_1/nH_2 = M_1/M_2 =1.5/1.2=1.25,

then ratio is 3.98 *1.25 ≈4.975.

Which is not an option. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the H ratio.

Alternatively, maybe the mass doesn't directly affect the H ratio in the photosphere, and the problem expects us to assume nH_1 =nH_2.

If that's the case, the ratio is 3.98, which is approximately 3.9, option A.

Another angle: perhaps the [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 tells us something about [Si/H]_2.

In Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → which is the same as [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so 0 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3 → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Which I already used.

Hmm. So the ratio of (nSi_1/nSi_2) is 3.98 * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

But without knowing (nH_1/nH_2 ), I can't compute it exactly.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same surface gravity, leading to the same scale height, and thus the same H density in their photospheres. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of hydrogen atoms per unit volume (nH) is the same in both stars. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the H ratio and expects us to compute the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star, then compare their Si/H.

So, Si_1/H_1 =10^0.3 * (Si_sun/H_sun ), and Si_2/H_2 =10^-0.3 * (Si_sun/H_sun ).

So the ratio (Si_1/H_1)/(Si_2/H_2 )=10^0.6=3.98 ~4.

But that would be the same as option A.

Alternatively, because the problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which are nSi_1 /nSi_2.

If both stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms (H1=H2), then the ratio is 3.98.

But if H1 and H2 differ, the ratio changes.

I think the problem expects us to assume that the number of hydrogen atoms (nH) is the same for both stars, leading to the ratio ~3.98 or ~4. But the options don't have 4. The closest is A) ~3.9.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (nSi_1/nSi_2 )= ( [Si/H]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 ) / ( [Si/H]_2 + [Fe/H]_2 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the actual number ratios.

In the Sun, nFe/nH =1e-4.5, nMg/nH=1e-5, nSi/nH=1e-4.5.

Star_1: [Fe/H]=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun=1e-4.5.

[Si/Fe]=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 =10^0.3 → nSi_1=(10^0.3)*(nFe_1)=10^0.3 *1e-4.5 *nH_1.

So nSi_1 =1e-4.5 *10^0.3 *nH_1.

Wait, because nFe_1= nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH_1 =1e-4.5 *nH_1.

Similarly, Star_2: [Mg/H]=0 →nMg_2/nH_2 =1e-5.

[Mg/Si]=0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2=10^0.3 → nSi_2= nMg_2/(10^0.3 )= (1e-5 *nH_2 ) /10^0.3.

So nSi_1 =1e-4.5 *10^0.3 *nH_1.

nSi_2 = (1e-5 )/10^0.3 *nH_2.

So the ratio is (nSi_1)/(nSi_2 )= [1e-4.5 *10^0.3 *nH_1 ] / [ (1e-5 /10^0.3 ) *nH_2 ]

Simplify:

= (1e-4.5 / 1e-5 ) * (10^0.3^2 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

= (10^0.5 ) * (10^0.6 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

=10^(0.5+0.6) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

=10^1.1 * (nH_1/nH_2 )≈12.589 * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

But again, we're stuck with (nH_1/nH_2 ).

Unless the number of hydrogen atoms is the same for both stars, which would make nH_1/nH_2=1, leading to 12.589, which is option B) ~12.6.

But why would nH_1 =nH_2? Because then the stars would have the same number of H atoms in their photosphere, which depends on their surface area and scale height.

Hmm, but the problem gives the masses, which might relate to the number of H atoms.

Wait, if the number of H atoms is proportional to the mass, then nH_1/nH_2 =1.5/1.2=1.25.

So,

12.589 *1.25 ≈15.736.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if the problem considers the same surface gravity, leading to the same scale height and same pressure, then the number of H atoms per unit area would be the same.

In that case, the number of H atoms would be proportional to the surface area.

Surface area A=4pi R^2.

If both stars have the same radius, then A would be same, leading to same nH. But without knowing their radii, we can't say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H terms and only consider the [Si/H] values, leading to a ratio of ~4, which is option A.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, in Star_1, nSi_1=1e-4.5 *10^0.3 *nH_1.

In Star_2, nSi_2= (1e-5 /10^0.3 ) *nH_2.

So,

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (1e-4.5 *10^0.3 *nH_1 ) / (1e-5 *10^-0.3 *nH_2 )

= (1e-4.5 /1e-5 ) * (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

=10^0.5 *10^0.6 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

=10^(0.5+0.6) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

=10^1.1 * (nH_1/nH_2 )= ~12.589 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

If (nH_1/nH_2 )= (M_1 / M_2 )=1.5/1.2=1.25.

Then, 12.589 *1.25= ~15.736, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps (nH_1/nH_2 )=1.

Then, ratio is ~12.589, which is option B.

But why would (nH_1/nH_2 )=1? Perhaps because both stars have the same number of H atoms in their photospheres, which could be the case if they have similar temperatures and radii, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the H ratio, and expects the ratio to be 10^1.1=12.589. So option B.

But earlier when I thought the ratio is ~4, the options have A)~3.9, which is close. But perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio without considering (nH_1/nH_2 ).

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the ratio of silicon atoms per unit hydrogen, not the total number. So [Si/H]_1/[Si/H]_2=10^0.3 /10^-0.3=10^0.6≈3.98. So the ratio is ~4, which is option A.

But the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which I think refers to nSi_1/nSi_2, not [Si/H].

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to summarize.

Approach 1:

Compute nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of nH and the solar values, then find their ratio.

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *10^0.3 ) *nH_1.

nSi_2 = (1e-5 /10^0.3 ) *nH_2.

Ratio= [ (1e-4.5 *10^0.3 ) / (1e-5 *10^-0.3 ) ] * (nH_1/nH_2 )

= (1e-4.5 /1e-5 ) * (10^0.3 *10^0.3 ) * (nH_1/nH_2 )

=10^0.5 *10^0.6 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

=10^1.1 * (nH_1/nH_2 )= ~12.589 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

Approach 2:

Assume nH_1/nH_2=1 → ratio=12.589, option B.

But I don't have a justification to assume that.

Alternative, perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of H atoms is the same for both stars, leading to nH_1/nH_2=1.

But why would that be the case? Perhaps because the problem doesn't provide enough info, and the intended approach is to compute the [Si/H] ratio, leading to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Approach 1 and the correct ratio is 10^0.6=3.98, which is option A.

Wait, looking back, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms. That would be nSi_1/nSi_2.

Another possibility: the problem is only considering the relative enhancement in silicon, not the absolute number.

Wait, in Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3, and [Fe/H]=0 → [Si/H]=0.3.

In Star_2, [Mg/Si]=0.3 → since [Mg/H]=0 → [Si/H]=-0.3.

So the [Si/H] of Star_1 is higher than Star_2 by 0.6 dex, which is a factor of 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So the ratio of their silicon abundance relative to hydrogen is 3.98. But the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which would depend on the number of H atoms in each star.

If Star_1 has more H atoms, then the total Si count could be higher.

But without knowing the H ratio, perhaps the intended answer is 3.98 (option A).

Given the confusion, I'll go with option A) ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Data and Definitions:
1. **Abundance Ratios**:
   - For Star_1:
     - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log₁₀(nSi₁/nFe₁) = 0.3 → nSi₁/nFe₁ = 10⁰.³ ≈ 2.
     - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe₁/nH₁ = nFe_sun/nH_sun.
   - For Star_2:
     - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log₁₀(nMg₂/nSi₂) = 0.3 → nMg₂/nSi₂ = 10⁰.³ ≈ 2.
     - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg₂/nH₂ = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

2. **Solar Composition**:
   - nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10⁻⁴.⁵.
   - nMg_sun/nH_sun = 10⁻⁵.
   - Since [Si/Fe]_sun = 0, nSi_sun/nFe_sun = 1 → nSi_sun/nH_sun = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10⁻⁴.⁵.

3. **Relative Ratios**:
   - For Star_1: nSi₁/nH₁ = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) × 10⁰.³ ≈ 10⁻⁴.⁵ × 2.
   - For Star_2: nSi₂/nH₂ = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / 10⁰.³ ≈ 10⁻⁵ / 2.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_1}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}_2}\right)} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2}.
\]

1. **Relative Abundance Ratios**:
   - From the solar values:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_1} = 10^{-4.5} \times 10^{0.3}, \quad \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}_2} = \frac{10^{-5}}{10^{0.3}}.
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_1} \bigg/ \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}_2} = \frac{10^{-4.5} \times 10^{0.3}}{\frac{10^{-5}}{10^{0.3}}} = 10^{0.6}.
     \]

2. **Hydrogen Ratio**:
   - The problem does not explicitly provide the ratio of hydrogen atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. However, assuming the stars have similar compositions and photospheric conditions, it is reasonable to assume \( n_{\text{H}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_2 = 1 \).

3. **Final Ratio**:
   - Substituting \( n_{\text{H}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}_2 = 1 \):
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.98**, which corresponds to option **A**.
