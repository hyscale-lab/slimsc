Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Let's try to break this down. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun, respectively. But I don't think mass directly affects the ratio for this question; it's more about the elemental abundances.

The data provided is the elemental abundances using the EW method, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The values given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

I remember that the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(N_X / N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_Sun. Or wait, more accurately, [X/Y] = log(N_X / N_Y) - log(N_X_sun / N_Y_sun) = log( (N_X / N_Y) / (N_X_sun / N_Y_sun) ) = log( (N_X / N_X_sun) / (N_Y / N_Y_sun) )).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The definition is [X/Y] = log10(N_X / N_Y) - log10(N_X_sun / N_Y_sun). So, if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y compared to the Sun.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, that's log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = 3.16e-5.
Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait, no. Wait, I think the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals those numbers. So for Fe, 12 + log(Fe/H) =7.5 → log(Fe/H) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So Fe/H = 10^(-4.5). Same for Mg: log(Mg/H)=7-12= -5 → Mg/H=1e-5.

Okay, so moving on. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 photospheres, which is [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2], or wait, no—wait, the ratio would be (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

But maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps we need to compute the ratio of their silicon abundances
