Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to astronomy, so let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But the question is about their brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means any star with V less than 17 (since lower magnitude is brighter) can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, stars with V <16 can be detected.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the way it's phrased is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Oh wait, no, the V magnitudes brighter than 17. So brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So that means ESPRESSO can observe stars down to V=17. So any star with V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so V magnitude less than 16? Or greater? Hmm. No, wait, wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent
