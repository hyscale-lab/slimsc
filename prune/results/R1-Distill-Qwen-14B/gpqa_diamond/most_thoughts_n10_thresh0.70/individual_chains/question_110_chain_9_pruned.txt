Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different brightness limits. Let me start breaking this down.

First, I'll recall what each spectrograph can handle. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, their limit is V < 17. HIRES, on the other hand, can see stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be visible by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16 because HIRES can't go beyond that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," meaning that ESPRESSO can see stars that are up to 17 mag. So the apparent V must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO? Or wait, "brighter than 17" would mean lower magnitude. Oh right, the magnitude scale is inverted, so a lower number is brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's apparent V magnitude less than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars with V ≤17.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, V ≤16. So the star must have V ≤16 to be visible by both.

Wait, because both require apparent V magnitude to be below their respective limits. So a star that's too faint (high V mag) won't be seen by either, but to be seen by both, it needs to have V mag ≤16, because HIRES goes up to 16. So both spectrographs can detect it if the star's apparent magnitude is ≤16.

So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which are ≤16.

Let's look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. Apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d is 10, so log(10/10) is zero. So m = 15.5 + 0 =15.5. So m=15.5. Which is less than 16, so it's visible to both.

Wait, but wait, Star1's DEC is -75 degrees. Wait, but the question says to disregard pointing limits, so I can ignore that. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. So ESPRESSO can see it, and HIRES can too. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5, which is higher than 16. So HIRES can't see it. Wait, HIRES can only go up to 16. So Star2's apparent V is 16.5, which is beyond HIRES's limit. So Star2 is visible only by ESPRESSO? Because 16.5 is less than 17. Wait, ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So Star2 has m=16.5, which is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES can't because 16.5>16. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: It has an apparent V of 15.5 mag, but wait, that's the observed apparent magnitude? Or is there extinction? Oh, no, wait the question says that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So there's reddening, which affects the apparent magnitude. So I need to calculate the extinction-corrected apparent magnitude or the actual observed one?

Wait, no, wait. The V magnitude as given is the apparent magnitude, but that's the observed value including extinction. Or is it? Wait, when a star has extinction, the observed apparent magnitude (what we see) is larger (fainter) than the intrinsic. Because extinction (dust) makes stars appear dimmer (higher mag).

Wait, the question says for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6. The formula for extinction in V band is A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_v = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude (m_observed) is m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, but in the problem statement, Star3 says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". Hmm, but if Star3's actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be m_intrinsic, and the observed is 15.5, which is m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

The apparent magnitude as observed is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

But in
