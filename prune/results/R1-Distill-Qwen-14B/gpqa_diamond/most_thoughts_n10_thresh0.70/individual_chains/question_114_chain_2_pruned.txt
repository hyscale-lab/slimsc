Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents from the options given. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

And the options are A, B, C, D, each with different A and B reagents.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember the relevant reactions. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The product has a nitrile group (CN) and a hydroxyl group (OH) on the same carbon. So the starting ketone is converting into a cyanohydrin.

Oh wait! I remember that the formation of cyanohydrins typically involves a ketone reacting with a cyanide source, like NaCN, in the presence of an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion (CN-) is a nucleophile, but ketones aren't very reactive towards nucleophilic addition without some activation. So the acid probably protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, and then the CN- attacks.

So in the first reaction, the reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+ (which is a strong acid) or maybe another acid like H2SO4, but the options suggest H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm. So what's the role of A here? It's the catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation reaction. So that would typically be an acid, like H+.

So for the first reaction, A should be an acid. Therefore, options A and B are possible for A being H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (that's a mouthful) reacts with B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid group. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under various conditions. One common method is hydrolysis with strong acid, like HCl, or strong base, like NaOH. But wait, the presence of a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group is part of a neighboring group that could influence the reaction.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is converted to COOH. Let me think about the reagents for nitrile to carboxylic acid conversion.

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions and heat. For example, in acidic conditions, it's often done with HCl (like concentrated HCl) under reflux. Alternatively, using a strong base like aqueous NaOH and then acidifying.

But wait, in this case, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So it's a cyanohydrin. Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when you hydrolyze it, maybe it's under acidic or basic conditions?

Wait, let me think. The reaction is nitrile→carboxylic acid. So in acidic conditions, like HCl, it might protonate and then add water. Or in basic conditions, maybe via a hydroxide attack.

Wait, another possibility: the nitrile is treated with an acid catalyst and water. But then, what's the typical reagent for this? Alternatively, maybe it's using something like H2O with an acid or a base.

Wait, wait. Another thought: maybe the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So the reagents would be H2O in acidic or basic conditions.

But the question says that
