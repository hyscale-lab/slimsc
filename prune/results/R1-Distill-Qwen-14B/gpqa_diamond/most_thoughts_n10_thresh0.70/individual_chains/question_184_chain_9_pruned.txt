Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering might matter. Oh, right, in such cases, the substituents are numbered to get the lowest possible numbers. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro.

Wait, let me clarify: The numbering should be such that the substituents get the lowest numbers. So if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's the first possible. So the substituents are in the ortho, meta positions relative to each other.

So the target is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in 3, and tert-butyl in 2? Wait, maybe I should sketch it. Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a line. So 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene to make this compound. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

I need to figure out the correct order of substituting groups and the directing effects each group has.

So, benzene is the starting material. We need to introduce three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro.

But the order matters because each group directs incoming substituents to certain positions.

Let me consider each substituent and their directing effects.

Nitro groups are meta directors. They deactivate the ring (strongly deactivating, because they're electron-withdrawing).

Ethoxy groups are ortho/para directors. They are activating because the OCH2CH3 is an electron-donating group (through resonance).

tert-butyl is a bulky group, but it's an activating, ortho/para director because it's an alkyl group (electron-donating via induction, but bulky).

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, the positions where new groups enter depend on the existing substituents and their directing effects.

So, the plan is to add substituents in an order where each new group goes into the correct position relative to the existing groups.

Let me think: which substituent should be added first, second, third?

Wait, but let's think about the substituents in the target molecule. It's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So, relative positions: ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in 3 (which is meta to ethoxy), and tert-butyl in 2 (ortho to ethoxy, meta to nitro? Or maybe not. Let me think about the arrangement.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a directing effect strategy.

If I add nitro first, as a meta director, then the next substituent would go into the meta position relative to nitro. But then adding ethoxy or tert-butyl next.

Alternatively, if I add the tert-butyl first, which is an activating, ortho/para director, that would influence where the next substituents go.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the activating groups first, since they can be more easily added on an activating ring.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group. So perhaps it's better to add activating groups first before adding nitro, because once the ring is deactivated, adding substituents becomes harder.

Alternatively, since nitro is a meta director, perhaps it's introduced
