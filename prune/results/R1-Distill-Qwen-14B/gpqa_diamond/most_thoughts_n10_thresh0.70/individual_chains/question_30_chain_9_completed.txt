Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and light absorption. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a textile dye that emits light with a certain energy, and we need to find out what color it absorbs. 

Wait, I remember something about complementary colors. Oh right! When a substance emits light of a certain color, it's because it absorbed the complementary color. So if it emits, say, red, then it absorbed blue or something like that. Because when you mix colors, the colors that are opposite on the color wheel are complementary. So the emitted color is what's left after absorbing the complementary one.

The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I think I need to find the wavelength corresponding to that energy. Oh wait, because energy and wavelength are related by E = hc/λ. So h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is speed of light, 3.0e8 m/s. But wait, the energy here is in eV, so maybe I should convert it to joules first.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 2.3393 eV would be 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me calculate that. 2.3393 * 1.602 is... let me see, 2 * 1.602 is 3.204, 0.3393 * 1.602 is roughly 0.543, so total about 3.747e-19 J.

Now, E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E. So plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3.0e8 m/s
E = 3.747e-19 J

λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 3.747e-19
Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide that by 3.747e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.747e-19 = (1.9878 / 3.747) * 1e-6. 

Calculating 1.9878 / 3.747: approx 0.531. So 0.531e-6 meters, which is 531 nm. 

What color is 531 nm? Wait, the visible spectrum ranges from about 400 (violet) to 700 (red) nm. So 531 is in the green area. Wait, but wait, red is around 650-700, blue is about 450-500, green is around 500-570. So 531 is green. 

Oh wait, but the question is about the absorbed color. Because the dye emits at 531 nm (green), it must have absorbed the complementary color. So what's complementary to green? It's magenta? Or maybe I should think in terms of the color wheel. The complementary color to green is magenta or red-purple. Wait, but the options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of energy. The emitted photon energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon would have higher energy than that because in fluorescence, the molecule absorbs higher energy and emits lower energy (because some energy is lost as heat or other processes). Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to an excited state, and then emits when it relaxes. The energy of the emitted photon is usually less than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed would be higher. So higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength. So the absorbed light is in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) region than 531 nm. So, what's 531 nm's complementary color?

Wait, the color wheel: green is between yellow and blue. The complementary color would be magenta, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, but the options given are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, maybe I should think about the color absorbed as what's in the region of higher energy than the emitted. So 531 nm is green; the absorbed must be in the higher energy region, which is towards the blue/violet end.

Wait, but let's calculate the wavelength absorbed. Wait, I think I might have messed up. When a molecule absorbs light, the energy absorbed corresponds to the energy gap. So the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which excites it. Then when it emits, it emits a photon of energy E_emit, which is less than E_abs because some energy is lost as heat or other processes. So, E_abs is higher than E_emit.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the wavelength of absorbed photon is shorter than 531 nm.

What's the color of a photon with wavelength shorter than 531 nm? The visible spectrum goes from 400 (violet) to 700 (red). So shorter than 531 is blue or violet.

Looking at the options, we have options B) Violet and C) Blue. So which is it?

Hmm, 531 nm is green. The complementary color would be in the opposite part of the color wheel. Let me visualize the color wheel. The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. The complementary colors are: red's complement is greenish cyan, blue's complement is orange, and yellow's complement is violet. Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, the color wheel is arranged so that each color is opposite its complement. So green (around 530 nm) is opposite to magenta (which is a combination of red and blue), but since magenta isn't an option, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of absorption can be calculated. But wait, the question states that the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV, so it absorbed a higher energy photon.

Let me think about the possible options. The options given are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Red is about 650 nm (energy around 1.9 eV?), wait no, higher energy is lower wavelength. Wait, 650 nm would be E = hc/lambda. Let me compute E for 650 nm.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (650e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (650e-9) ) = approx 3.058e-19 J → 3.058e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 1.908 eV.

So red is about 1.9 eV. But the emitted energy is 2.34 eV, which is higher than that. So the emitted photon is higher energy than red. So the absorbed photon must have even higher energy? Wait, no, because the emitted is lower than absorbed. Wait, no, the emitted is lower energy than the absorbed. So if the emitted is 2.34 eV, the absorbed is higher than that.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy emitted is 2.34 eV. The energy absorbed must be higher because the molecule goes from ground state to excited state when absorbing, then emits when it relaxes, losing some energy. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted.

So, the absorbed photon has higher energy, which means lower wavelength (since E is inversely proportional to wavelength). So the absorbed light is in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) part of the spectrum.

The possible options are red (650, 1.9 eV), violet (around 400 nm, E= 3 eV?), blue (around 450 nm, E=2.75 eV?), yellow (around 570, E≈2.17 eV).

Wait, let me compute the energies for the options. So:

Option A) Red: ~650 nm → E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (650e-9) → as before ≈1.9 eV.

Option B) Violet: say 400 nm.

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(400e-9) = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 400e-9 m gives 1.9878e-25 /4e-7 = approx 4.9695e-19 J. Convert to eV: 4.9695e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈3.1 eV.

Option C) Blue: ~450 nm.

E= (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(450e-9) = 1.9878e-25 /4.5e-7 = 4.417e-19 J → 4.417e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈ 2.756 eV.

Option D) Yellow: ~570 nm.

E= (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(570e-9) → 1.9878e-25 /5.7e-7 = 3.487e-19 J → 3.487 /1.602 ≈ 2.176 eV.

So the emitted energy is 2.34 eV. The absorbed energy must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon must have energy higher than 2.34 eV. Looking at the options, the photon energies for the absorption must be higher than 2.34 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) Red: 1.9 eV → no, too low.

B) Violet: 3.1 eV → higher than 2.34 → possible.

C) Blue: 2.756 eV → higher than 2.34 → possible.

D) Yellow: 2.17 eV → no, lower than 2.34.

So the absorbed light must be either violet or blue.

Wait, but the emitted light is 2.34 eV which is green, and the absorbed must be higher. So the absorbed could be either blue or violet.

Wait, which option is higher than 2.34? Both B and C.

So how to decide between blue and violet.

Wait, let's think about the complementary color. If the dye emits green, what color would it absorb? The complementary of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is referring to the absorbed color, which is in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) part.

In the options, violet and blue are both higher energy than emitted. So which is the correct one?

Wait, the emitted color is green, so the absorbed would be a color that's on the opposite side of the color wheel. Green is in the middle between blue and yellow. So the complementary would be a combination of red and blue (magenta), but perhaps the nearest option is violet or blue.

Wait, wait. The color wheel's complementary pairs are:

Red ↔ Cyan

Green ↔ Magenta

Blue ↔ Yellow

Wait, so green's complement is magenta, which is a mix of red and blue. So if a substance emits green, it absorbs magenta. But since the options don't have magenta, perhaps the closest option is violet, which is a component of magenta.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon is in the green, which means it absorbed a higher energy (violet or blue) photon.

But how to determine whether it's blue or violet. Let's think in terms of the energy.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed energy must be higher. So the absorbed photon has E_abs = E_emit + some energy (since when a molecule absorbs, it goes to a higher energy state, then emits when it relaxes, but in fluorescence, the emitted photon is lower energy; but for the absorption, the energy is higher).

So to find the absorbed energy, what's the typical photon energies for these colors:

Violet is around 3.1 eV (400 nm), and blue is around 2.75 eV (450 nm). So both are higher than 2.34 eV.

So both B and C are possible. But the options are given as B) Violet and C) Blue.

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the question says: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So it absorbed light of higher energy. So the absorbed photon is either violet or blue.

But which one? How do I decide?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons can help. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed must be higher. Let's say it's blue at 2.75 eV. Then the energy difference is 0.41 eV, which is in the infrared, which is not visible. Alternatively, if the absorbed is violet at 3.1 eV, the energy difference is about 0.76 eV. But in fluorescence, the energy difference can be significant, but perhaps the exact value isn't as important as knowing that the absorbed photon must be higher energy.

So both options B and C are possible, but only one is among the options.

Wait, the question asks what color is absorbed. The options are A: Red, B:Violet, C:Blue, D:Yellow.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is about 531 nm (green). The absorbed photon must have a wavelength shorter than that (higher energy). So the absorbed color is either blue (450 nm, 2.75 eV) or violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV).

So among the options, both B and C are higher than emitted. So which one is it?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the exact energy but about the color that a dye would typically absorb. Many dyes absorb in the blue region and emit in the complementary color. For example, if a dye emits green, it might absorb in the blue.

Wait, but wait, the complementary color to green is magenta. So the dye would absorb magenta light. But since the options don't have magenta, perhaps the closest is either violet or blue.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit tricky, and the emitted photon's energy is the one that's the complement of the absorbed. Wait, no, no. The emitted photon is what's left after the dye absorbed the rest. So the dye's color is determined by what it emits, which is the complementary color of what it absorbs.

Wait, another way: The color wheel. The color we see is the color that is not absorbed. So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed the complementary color (magenta), which includes red and blue. But among the options, the closest would be either blue or violet. But how?

Wait, perhaps the emitted light is green, so the absorbed is magenta. But since the options don't have magenta, maybe the absorbed color is in the blue/violet range. So the correct answer would be either B or C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact energy of the absorbed photon. Wait, but the question doesn't give any more data. It just gives the emitted photon's energy.

Hmm. Wait, maybe the energy of the absorbed photon is exactly double the emitted or something? I don't think so. It's more about the position in the visible spectrum.

Wait, perhaps the light emitted is in the green, so it absorbed the higher energy (lower wavelength) light. So the absorbed light is in the blue or violet region.

So let's think: if the emitted is green (531 nm), the absorbed would be in the blue-violet region.

Looking at the options, blue is 450 nm (2.75 eV) and violet is 400 nm (3.1 eV). So which one is higher than 2.34 eV? Both are.

Wait, but wait, both B and C are higher. So how to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the emitted photon is green, so the absorbed photon is in the blue region. Because the complementary of green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. So maybe the dye absorbs blue light and emits green? Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, here's another approach. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have higher energy. So it's either blue (2.75 eV) or violet (3.1 eV).

But the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green, it absorbed a higher energy photon. So the options are B and C.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the absorbed color, which is blue. Because green is in the middle, and the complementary is magenta, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is blue (option C) because blue is the closest to magenta among the options. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another way to think: the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted. The emitted is 2.34 eV. So the absorbed must be higher. The options with higher are B (3.1) and C (2.75). Both are higher. So which one is more likely?

In many dye examples, the absorbed photon is in the visible range. For example, many dyes absorb in the blue or violet regions and emit in the complementary colors. For instance, fluorescein absorbs blue light and emits green.

So in this case, if the dye emits green, it likely absorbs blue. Because blue is at 450 nm (2.75 eV), which is higher than green's 531 nm (2.34 eV). So the absorbed would be blue light.

Wait, but then the emitted is green, which is the complementary of magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. So perhaps the absorbed is in the magenta region, but that's not an option. So if the options are limited, blue is the next best thing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the absorbed color is the opposite, so if the emitted is green, the absorbed must be magenta, which is red and blue, so perhaps red is not the answer. Hmm, that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the colors and their positions. Red is the longest wavelength (650 nm), then orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. So the emitted is green. The complementary color is magenta, but since magenta isn't an option, the closest might be violet or blue. But in the options, both are higher in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted energy corresponds to green (531 nm), so the absorbed must be in the blue or violet. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The energy of light is inversely proportional to wavelength. So higher energy, shorter wavelength. The emitted is 2.34 eV, which is green. So the absorbed must be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. So which of the options are higher in energy than 2.34 eV?

Option B: Violet (3.1 eV) → higher.

Option C: Blue (2.75 eV) → higher.

So both are higher. So how to choose between B and C.

Perhaps the correct answer is B) Violet, because it's a shorter wavelength than blue. Wait, but blue is 450 nm, which is shorter than green's 531. Violet is 400, which is even shorter. So if the emitted is green, and the absorbed must be higher energy, it's either blue or violet.

Wait, maybe the question is considering that green is between blue and yellow. So the complementary is red and blue (magenta). Alternatively, perhaps the answer is blue, as it's the closest option to magenta.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of examples. Turmeric is a yellow dye, but it absorbs in the blue region. If a dye emits green, it's likely absorbing blue or violet.

Wait, another angle: The energy difference between absorbed and emitted. The emitted is 2.34 eV. Suppose the absorbed is blue (2.75 eV). The difference is 0.41 eV. Or if the absorbed is violet (3.1 eV), the difference is 0.76 eV. Both are possible.

But without further information, perhaps the intended answer is blue. Because, for example, if a substance emits green, it might have absorbed blue light. For instance, in some fluorescent materials, blue light is absorbed and green emitted.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the emitted color is the complement of the absorbed, so if the emitted is green, the absorbed is magenta, but since magenta isn't an option, perhaps the question expects the opposite. Wait no, the question is about what is absorbed.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question says that the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed must be the complementary color, which is magenta. Since magenta isn't an option, the closest option would be a combination of red and blue. But the options don't have magenta, so perhaps the intended answer is blue.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me see the options again. The options are A:Red, B:Violet, C:Blue, D:Yellow.

Now, the emitted is green, so the absorbed must be magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. So if the options don't have magenta, perhaps the answer is blue. Or perhaps the question is considering the absorbed color as blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted is 2.34 eV, and the absorbed could be blue (2.75 eV), which is higher. So the answer is C) Blue.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the energy, blue is higher than green's 2.34 eV. So if the dye absorbs blue (2.75 eV), it emits green (2.34 eV). That makes sense.

So I think the correct answer is C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as 2.3393 eV. Using the relationship between energy and wavelength, \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), we calculate the corresponding wavelength of the emitted light. Converting the energy to joules (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we find:

\[
E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} = 2.3393 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \approx 3.747 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{3.747 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \approx 531 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This wavelength corresponds to green light. Since the compound emits green light, it must absorb light of a complementary color. The complementary color to green is magenta, which is not one of the options. Therefore, we consider the options provided: red, violet, blue, and yellow.

The absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted light because the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed photon due to energy loss during the excitation and relaxation process. Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths. Among the options:

- **Red (650 nm)**: Energy \( \approx 1.9 \, \text{eV} \), which is lower than the emitted energy (\( 2.34 \, \text{eV} \)), so it cannot be absorbed.
- **Violet (400 nm)**: Energy \( \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV} \), which is higher than the emitted energy, so it could be absorbed.
- **Blue (450 nm)**: Energy \( \approx 2.75 \, \text{eV} \), which is higher than the emitted energy, so it could also be absorbed.
- **Yellow (570 nm)**: Energy \( \approx 2.17 \, \text{eV} \), which is lower than the emitted energy, so it cannot be absorbed.

Both violet and blue have higher energy than the emitted green light. However, the complementary color to green is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. Since magenta is not an option, the closest match is blue, as it is a primary color and more directly associated with the absorption of green light in many dye systems.

Thus, the compound absorbs blue light and emits green light.

Answer: C
