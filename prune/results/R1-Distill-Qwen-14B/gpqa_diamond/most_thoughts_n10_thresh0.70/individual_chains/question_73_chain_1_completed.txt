Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. The other has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, also in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. So for the relative speed, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), right? But wait, I should make sure I have the right signs. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be the difference in their speeds. So for astronaut 1 moving at u and astronaut 2 at v, the relative speed from 1's perspective would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Let me plug in the numbers. Astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's calculate that denominator.

0.6c *0.5c = 0.3 c². Divide by c², that's 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c when rounded. So that would be the relative speed. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So that's a clue.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. I think each astronaut's total energy would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by m c squared. Since one is 2m and the other is 3m, I'll have to calculate each energy and add them.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that for each.

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma for astronaut 1: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * m c² * mass. Wait, wait. Wait, no. The formula is E = gamma * m c². So for astronaut 1: E1 = gamma * (2m) c². So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma for astronaut 2: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma * (3m) c². So E2 ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.1547 times 3 is approximately 3.464, yes.

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So that's around 5.96 m c², right?

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D's E is 5 mc², which doesn't match. So the correct option would have E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. That's option C.

Wait, but wait a moment. When calculating the relative speed, which astronaut's frame are we considering? Because the velocity addition formula gives the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the relative speed between them. So if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, then from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²) )= 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: in the problem statement, the astronauts are traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. So the relative speed is 0.1c in the denominator calculation, which gave us 0.14c. So that's correct.

So putting it all together, the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be option C.

Let me double-check the calculations.

For the relative speed: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c /0.7 = 0.142857c ≈ 0.14c. Yes.

For the energy:

Astronaut 1: v=0.6c. gamma= 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/0.8=1.25. So E1 =1.25 * 2m c²=2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: v=0.5c. gamma=1/sqrt(1-0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)= approx 1.1547. So E2=1.1547 * 3m c²=3.464 m c².

Adding them: 2.5 +3.464=5.964 m c². So E≈5.96 m c².

So between the options, only option C matches both the relative speed and the total energy.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut 1 moves at \( u = 0.6c \) and astronaut 2 moves at \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \). For each astronaut:

1. **Astronaut 1** (mass \( 2m \), velocity \( 0.6c \)):
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **Astronaut 2** (mass \( 3m \), velocity \( 0.5c \)):
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
