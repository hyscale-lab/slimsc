Alright, so I'm trying to tackle this electron microscopy question. Let me read it carefully and think through what's going on here.

Okay, the setup is about a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 1000 kV. Mike is using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because having gas around can interfere with the electron beam—like causing scattering and reducing image quality.

But even with all that, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them, so Mike knows they're present. He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules under the vacuum conditions as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? And for that, factors like pressure, temperature, and compartment volume would matter.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, something interesting happens. He notices that the mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The question is, what can we say about λ2 compared to λ1? The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. I remember that the mean free path (λ) is related to the pressure of the gas. The formula I think is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the mean collision diameter, and P is pressure. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as λ = (1.6667 * sqrt(T)) / (sqrt(P)) * some constant maybe? Wait, perhaps it's more precise to recall the formula λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P). So as pressure decreases, the mean free path increases because P is in the denominator.

But wait, in this scenario, the pressure is already ultra-low, but when the electron beam is on, does something change about the pressure? Or maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in another way.

Wait, the question says the temperature remains the same, so T is constant. So if the pressure in the compartment is the same, then λ should remain the same. But Mike's observation says λ changes to λ2.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes some kind of interaction with the gas molecules, like ionization or heating? Because when the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam—1000 kV is a lot of energy. The electrons might strike the gas molecules, causing them to ionize. Or maybe the gas molecules get heated because of the beam.

Oh! If the gas is ionized, it becomes charged, and charged particles might interact differently with the electric fields in the microscope. But how does that affect the mean free path? Well, ionization would change the nature of the gas. But wait, in terms of pressure, if the gas is ionized, does that reduce the number of neutral particles, which are the ones that would be scattering the electrons? So perhaps the effective pressure changes.

Wait, another angle. The mean free path is determined by the number of gas particles present. If the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, the number of neutral atoms or molecules would decrease. Because ionized particles might have different behavior, but in terms of collisions, perhaps they don't contribute as much. Or maybe the ions are accelerated away by the electric fields in the microscope, leading to a lower effective pressure.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, some gas particles could be removed. For example, if the gas is at such a low pressure, and the beam is on, the beam might cause the gas to be pumped out more effectively, but that seems unlikely because the pumps are already running. Or perhaps the beam itself isn't contributing to pumping.

Wait, another possibility: the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be excited or even expelled from the sample compartment. If the gas pressure effectively decreases when the beam is on, that would increase the mean free path. Because lower pressure means
