Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions in its core. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chains. I think there are three branches, right? pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. So I need to focus on that.

Neutrinos are produced in these reactions, and their flux on Earth depends on the reactions happening in the Sun's core. The question says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that reaction should have already reached us, but the other reactions are still going on. Or wait, maybe the neutrinos are produced instantly when the reaction stops, so the change in flux would be noticed immediately. Hmm, not sure.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux is the number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second in each band.

Wait, I remember that the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Because the pp-III chain involves more energetic reactions. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The pp-I chain is the main one, which produces lower energy neutrinos, around 0.5 MeV or so. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher energies. Or wait, maybe the pp-III produces even higher energy neutrinos than pp-II.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos would drop. But which bands are affected? The bands are 700-800 and 800-900. So pp-III contributes more to the higher energy neutrinos. If pp-III stops, the flux in higher bands (like 800-900, band 2) would decrease more than the lower band (700-800, band 1). Or wait, maybe the higher band was only from pp-III?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall. The pp-III branch occurs when three helium-4 nuclei (He-4) fuse
