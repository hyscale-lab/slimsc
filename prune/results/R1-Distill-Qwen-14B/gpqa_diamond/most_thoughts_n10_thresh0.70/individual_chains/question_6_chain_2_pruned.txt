Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's see what the question is about. The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) given by (1/2)k r² plus (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Wait, so the potential is V(r,θ) = 1/2 kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me try to rewrite that a bit. Oh, right, 1/2 kr² is the usual harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions, right? But then there's this extra term, 3/2 kr² cos²θ. I'm thinking maybe I can separate this potential into components based on the angles or something.

Wait, I remember that in polar coordinates, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m) where p is the momentum operator. But the potential here has terms that depend on r and θ. I'm trying to think if this potential can be rewritten in terms that are easier to solve, perhaps using separation of variables.

Let me see. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out kr²: V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, but is there a way to write this in terms that separate θ dependence from r?

Wait, maybe I can express cos²θ in terms of cos(2θ), using a trigonometric identity. I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's substitute that in. So:

V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2)( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) ].

Calculating the terms inside the brackets: 1/2 + (3/2)(1/2) + (3/2)(cos2θ)/2. Wait, let's compute that step by step.

The original expression inside the square brackets is (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ. Substituting cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, we get:

1/2 + (3/2) * (1 + cos2θ
