Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's read the question again.

The problem says that in a certain region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is distance (r) in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So, r = 1/plx. This makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So, if r = 1/plx, then plx = 1/r. Let me write that down: plx = 1/r. So, plx is inversely proportional to r. That means as r increases, plx decreases.

The question states that the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/r. So plx = 1/r → 1/plx = r.

Wait, substituting plx into the equation for N, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx is 1/r, plx^5 is (1/r)^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be (r)^5.

So N ∝ r^5. That would mean as distance r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Because in reality, I'd expect that as you look further away (larger r), each shell at a given distance would have more stars, but perhaps the density decreases. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, let's think about it. The number of stars in a given region is being considered as a function of distance. So how does N change with r. If N is proportional to r^5, that would mean that as you go further away, each incremental unit of distance adds a lot more stars. But that doesn't make sense because as you go further, the density of stars should drop, right? Or maybe in this specific region, the way stars are distributed is such that the number increases with distance. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this more mathematically.

Wait, the number of stars in a region that's a certain distance away. Let's model it in terms of volume. Suppose we're looking at a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is about 4πr² dr. But wait, this is if we're considering all around, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Because the question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so maybe the distribution is such that the number of stars isn't following the typical volume-based distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation is per unit parallax, not per unit distance. So, if the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^5, then when
