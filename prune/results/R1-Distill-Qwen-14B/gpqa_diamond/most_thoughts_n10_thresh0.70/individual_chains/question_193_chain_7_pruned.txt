Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. The question says that astronomers observed the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula I know is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So distance r is 1/plx.

Wait, the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, I get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that. 1 over (1/r)^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, right. So if the number of stars is N(r) = kr^5, then the change in N with respect to r is the derivative. The derivative of r^5 is 5r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the options are about how N changes per unit range of r. So perhaps I'm thinking about it wrong. Oh wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"
