Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, so this is a two-dimensional potential in polar coordinates. I remember that in polar coordinates, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can sometimes be solved by separating variables, especially if the potential separates into functions of r and θ.

Let me write down the Schrödinger equation for this scenario. The Hamiltonian is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ). The kinetic energy part in polar coordinates is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²), right? So putting it all together, the equation becomes:

[- (ℏ²)/(2m) (d²/d r² + (1/r) d/d r) + (ℏ²)/(2m r²) (d²/dθ²) ) ] ψ(r, θ) + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] ψ(r, θ) = E ψ(r, θ)

Wait, actually, I think I should reorganize this. Let's factor out the r² terms. The potential can be written as (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, interesting. So V(r) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Let me think about the form of this potential. It looks like a radial part multiplied by a θ-dependent part. That suggests that the Schrödinger equation might be separable.

So, the idea is to try a solution of the form ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ). Substituting this into the Schrödinger equation should separate the variables r and θ. Let's try that.

Plugging ψ into the Schrödinger equation:

[- (ℏ²)/(2m) (R'' Θ + (1/r) R' Θ ) + (ℏ²)/(2m r²) R Θ'' ] + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] R Θ = E R Θ.

Dividing both sides by R Θ:

[- (ℏ²)/(2m) ( (R'' / R) + (1/r R')/R ) + (ℏ²)/(2m r²) (Θ''/Θ) ) ] + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] = E.

Hmm, I can rearrange terms to group the r and θ parts. Let me collect the terms involving r and θ. 

So, the equation becomes:

[ - (ℏ²)/(2m) ( R''/R + (1/r) R' / R ) + (1/2)k r² ] + [ (ℏ²)/(2m r²) (Θ''/Θ) + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] = E.

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange so that all the terms involving r are on one side and θ on the other.

Wait, let me think again. Let's separate the equation into terms involving R and Θ.

The equation becomes:

[ - (ℏ²)/(2m) R''/R - (ℏ²)/(2m r) R'/(R) + (1/2)k r² ] + [ (ℏ²)/(2m r²) Θ''/Θ + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] = E.

No, that's not quite right. Because the potential also depends on θ, the [3/2 k r² cos²θ] term complicates things because it's a function of θ. Hmm, perhaps the potential is actually separable? Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ). So it's like V(r) multiplied by a function of θ, which is (1 + 3 cos²θ). 

Wait, but in the Hamiltonian, the kinetic energy terms are functions of r and θ, but the potential also has a θ dependence. So the Hamiltonian is H = H_r + H_θ, but wait, no, because the potential has θ dependence. So I can't necessarily split the equation into purely r and θ terms because the potential itself depends on θ. Hmm, this complicates things. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe the potential is separable? Let me think. If I have V(r,θ) = A(r) + B(θ), then yes, I can separate the variables. But in this case, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos^2θ], which is (1/2 k r²) (1) plus (3/2 k r²) cos^2θ. So both terms are multiplied by r². So perhaps I can write it as [ (1/2)k r² ] multiplied by [1 + 3 cos^2θ]. So it's not a simple sum of a function of r and a function of theta—it's a product. Therefore, the potential is not separable in the way that allows straightforward separation of variables.

Hmm, so that complicates things. But wait, perhaps the overall potential can be rewritten. Let's think about the potential: (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. That's the same as (1/2) k r² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ]. Wait, but 1 + 3 cos²θ is a function of θ only. So, V(r,θ) = (1/2 k r² ) * [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Hmm, perhaps I can make a substitution to make the potential separable. Let me think about the angular part. Let me consider the term [1 + 3 cos²θ]. That can be expressed as 1 + 3 cos²θ = 3 cos²θ + 1 = 3 (cos²θ) + 1. Alternatively, using a trigonometric identity: cos 2θ = 2 cos²θ -1, so cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 = 1 + (3/2) + (3/2) cos 2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos 2θ.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps consider that 1 + 3 cos²θ = 3 ( (1/3) + cos²θ ). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of a radial part and an angular part. Let me see: V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos^2θ].

But if I have V(r,θ) = r² * f(θ), where f(θ) = (1/2)k [1 + 3 cos^2θ], then perhaps the potential is not separable.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the Schrödinger equation by considering the potential term as a multiplicative factor. Let's consider the overall equation again. The Schrödinger equation is:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) )/(R) ) - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²)/(Θ) ) ] + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] = E.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the terms. Let me bring all the terms involving r to one side and theta to the other. So I can write:

(ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) )/(R) ) = [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ - E ] - [ terms from angular part ]

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let's think about the type of potential given.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So this is a central potential (depends on r) multiplied by a function of θ. So it's not a purely central potential, but it has an anisotropic component because of the cos²θ term.

Hmm, maybe we can consider a coordinate transformation to make the potential separable. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates, which might make separation easier.

Wait, if we switch to Cartesian coordinates, then the potential might take a more manageable form. Let me think about that. In 2D polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r².

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, this is interesting. So V(r,θ) can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates as V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Let me simplify that. Combine the x² terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². That's (2k x²) + ( (k/2) y² ). So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (k/2) y². Oh, wait, so in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two quadratic terms in x and y, but with different coefficients. So this is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential.

Ah, right! So in two dimensions, this is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the potential is V(x) = m ω_x² x² / 2, and similarly for y. But in our case, after rewriting, it's V(x,y) = 2k x² + (k/2) y². Wait, perhaps I should factor out the k to see the frequencies.

Wait, let's calculate the effective frequencies for x and y directions. The standard harmonic oscillator potential is V = (1/2) m ω² r². So comparing to V(x) = 2k x², that would correspond to (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k. So ω_x = sqrt( (4k)/m ), because (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y component, V(y) = (k/2) y². So (1/2) m ω_y² = (k/2) → m ω_y² = k → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So in the x-direction, the oscillator has frequency ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), and in y-direction, frequency ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Now, in an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω_x, but wait, no, wait. Because the frequencies are different along x and y, the energy levels depend on both directions.

Wait, in the standard 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + 2) (ℏ ω)/2, but that's for isotropic case. In the anisotropic case, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ℏ ω_i, so the total energy is E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For each 1D harmonic oscillator, the energy is E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏ ω. So in 2D, with x and y oscillators, the total energy is E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

But in our case, ω_x is larger than ω_y. So each direction contributes its own (n + 1/2) term multiplied by its own frequency.

So substituting the frequencies we found: ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ * sqrt(k/m).

Simplify this: E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, because 2 sqrt(k/m) is 2 times sqrt(k/m), which is 2 (sqrt(k/m)).

Wait, let's compute:

First term: (n_x + 1/2) * 2 sqrt(k/m) = 2 n_x sqrt(k/m) + sqrt(k/m).

Second term: (n_y + 1/2) * sqrt(k/m) = n_y sqrt(k/m) + (1/2) sqrt(k/m).

So adding them together:

2 n_x sqrt(k/m) + sqrt(k/m) + n_y sqrt(k/m) + (1/2) sqrt(k/m).

Combine like terms:

(2 n_x + n_y) sqrt(k/m) + (1 + 1/2) sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) sqrt(k/m) * ℏ.

So the total energy is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C says E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me double-check the frequencies. Earlier, when I converted the potential into Cartesian coordinates, I found V(x,y) = 2k x² + (k/2) y².

Wait, let's re-express this potential in terms of standard harmonic oscillator form. For the x-direction, V_x = (1/2) m ω_x² x² = 2k x². So 1/2 m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for y: V_y = (1/2) m ω_y² y² = (k/2) y² → 1/2 m ω_y² =k/2 → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energies would be:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y

= (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Which is equal to:

2 (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(k/m) ℏ + (n_y + 1/2) sqrt(k/m) ℏ.

Factor out sqrt(k/m) ℏ:

[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding inside the brackets:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5.

So the energy is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking back at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches exactly.

So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The potential is not purely radial due to the angular dependence \( \cos^2(\theta) \), but it can be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates as \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{k}{2}y^2 \). This represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential.

In Cartesian coordinates, the potential is separable, with different frequencies for the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:
- For the \( x \)-direction, the frequency is \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), corresponding to the term \( 2kx^2 \).
- For the \( y \)-direction, the frequency is \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), corresponding to the term \( \frac{k}{2}y^2 \).

The energy spectrum for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator is the sum of the contributions from each direction:
\[
E = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega_x + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \omega_y,
\]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, respectively.

Substituting the frequencies \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), the total energy becomes:
\[
E = \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
E = \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

This matches the form given in option C. Therefore, the correct energy spectrum is:

**Answer: C**
