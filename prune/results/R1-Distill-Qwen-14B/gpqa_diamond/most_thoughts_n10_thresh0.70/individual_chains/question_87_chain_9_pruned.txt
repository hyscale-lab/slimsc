Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. And the ring is 6-membered, so that's the aromatic ring part. The total carbons are 8, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons because the ring itself is 6 carbons. Or wait, noâ€”wait, the ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 more. So the substituents are two groups that contribute 2 carbons in total. Hmm.

The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So that means one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, maybe an ester or something else?), and the other is a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. But wait, the substituents have to add up to two carbons. So possible substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is a single C=O) and an -X (like Cl, Br, etc.), but wait, the substituent with the carbonyl... Let me think.

Wait, the ring has two substituents. One has a carbonyl group, and the other has a halogen attached. So one substituent is an -X (like Cl, Br, etc.), and the other substituent is a group that includes a carbonyl. But since the total carbons are 8, the substituents contribute 8 - 6 = 2 carbons. So each substituent could be one carbon each, or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? Wait, no, both substituents are attached to the ring, so they each contribute at least one group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -X (like Cl) and an acyl group. Oh wait, but an acyl group would be something like -COR, which would have more than one carbon. Wait, maybe it's a substituent that's a carbonyl attached to the ring, such as a ketone. But the ring is 6 carbons, so substituents could be, for example, a Cl and a CO- group. Wait, CO- would be a carbonyl, but that's a substituent with one carbon (like a carbonyl as a substituent, but then the substituent would be, say, a ketone, which is a single carbon attached as a substituent. Hmm, but that might be tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group, which is -COCH3), but that's two carbons. Oh wait, but then the other substituent would have to be a single halogen, which is one carbon. Wait, but that would make substituents adding up to 3 carbons, which would make the total carbons 6 + 3 =9, but the question says 8. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a carbonyl as part of an ether, maybe a methoxycarbonyl group or something else
