Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says it's a spheroid shape with the symmetry along the z-axis. It oscillates, so it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and possible form of f.

Wait, I remember something about dipole radiation. Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)) when averaged over some time, but wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation is maximum at the equator, so theta=90 degrees. The intensity pattern is proportional to sin^2(theta). Or is it cos^2? Let me get this right.

Wait, the radiation intensity for a dipole is proportional to (sin^2(theta)), right? So when theta is 0 (along the axis), the intensity is zero. At 90 degrees, it's maximum. So, for theta=30 degrees, let's compute sin(theta).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the radiation pattern of a dipole in the far field is given by the formula for the electric field, which is proportional to (1/(r sin(theta))) * e^{i(kr - ωt)} }, but when you square the fields to get power, the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to 1/(r² sin²(theta)).

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing
