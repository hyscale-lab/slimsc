Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me read the question again.

We have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R and a small cavity inside. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and has a radius r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. Also, l and L are both bigger than R, and there's an angle theta between l and s.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity should induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, how exactly does that work?

So, when you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge opposite to q, right? Because the conductor was neutral before, the inner surface must have -q. But then, since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge remains zero.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. If you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's surface) must have -q induced to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge of the conductor remains zero (since it was uncharged before). So the conductor's outer surface has +q.

But the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. Because the conductor's own charges arrange themselves to make the electric field inside the conductor zero.

Wait, but how do we calculate the electric field outside a charged conductor? I think it's similar to that of a point charge at the center. So for a point outside, the field would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field at P would be like that of a point charge +q, located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but waitâ€”no. Because the point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. But the charge in the cavity
