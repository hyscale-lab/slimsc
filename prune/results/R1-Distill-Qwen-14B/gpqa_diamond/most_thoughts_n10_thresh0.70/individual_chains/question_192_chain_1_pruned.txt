Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The setup is a spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the cavity isn't at the center, it's offset. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity.

The question asks for the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor rearrange themselves. Also, the cavity being uncharged (since the conductor is uncharged initially) but with a charge placed inside it.

Wait, if the conductor is uncharged, but a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, then the conductor's charges would redistribute. Since the conductor is neutral, I think that the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it. Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral, since it was uncharged to begin with.

So the conductor's charges: inner surface has -q, outer surface has +q. So when considering the electric field outside the conductor, it's as if all the charge is at the center, right? Because the outer surface's charge distribution can be treated as a point charge for points outside the conductor.

Wait, let me think again. The cavity is not centered, so the inner charge -q is not at the same point as the conductor's center. So the outer surface's charge would be +q, but because of the cavity's position, would that affect the field outside?

Hmm, no. Because from the outside, the conductor looks like a shell with charge +q. The distribution might not be symmetrical, but for points outside, the field is as if all the charge is at the center of the sphere. So the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q.

Wait, no, wait. Because the charge inside the cavity is offset, the conductor's charges might not distribute uniformly. The inner surface would have -q, but the outer surface would have +q, but the arrangement of the conductor's charges on the outer surface might not be uniform. But for the purpose of calculating the electric field outside, does that matter?

I remember that the electric field outside a spherical shell of charge depends only on the total charge enclosed. So even if the shell isn't spherically symmetric, as long as it's a conductor, the external field behaves as if the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So regardless of the arrangement inside, the external field is as if all the +q is at the center.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So when you're outside the conductor, the field is due to the +q as if it's a point charge at the center.

But wait, the point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field at P would be as if a point charge +q is at the center, so E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that would be option B.

But wait, let me think again. What's the configuration inside the conductor? The inner surface has -q, and the outer surface +q. But because the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's charge isn't symmetric around the conductor's center. So the
