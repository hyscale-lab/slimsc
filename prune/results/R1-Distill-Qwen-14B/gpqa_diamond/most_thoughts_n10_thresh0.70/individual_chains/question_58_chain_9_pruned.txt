Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what regularization means. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities are a problem because they don't make physical sense, so regularization helps make the math work by introducing some kind of cutoff or smoothing.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So, the options are A to D. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different because it's a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. Strings are these tiny vibrating objects, right? I remember that string theories usually work at high energies because they have a mechanism to avoid the problems that other quantum field theories face. Maybe they don't need regularization because they don't have the same divergences? Or perhaps they handle things differently, like using different mathematical approaches. Not entirely sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory. At high energies, like in deep inelastic scattering or at short distances, quarks behave almost freely—that's asymptotic freedom. But wait, do you need regularization in QCD calculations? I think yes. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences. So they must use regularization methods, maybe like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, electrons, and photons. It's a well-established theory. I remember that QED does require renormalization. But wait, does that mean regularization? Because renormalization is a process that deals with the divergences, but regularization is the first step where you introduce a cutoff. So QED definitely needs regularization. For example, when calculating the electron self-energy, you get divergent integrals, so you need to regularize them before renormalizing. So C requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right! Classical theories don't involve quantum effects. So they don't have the same divergences that quantum theories have. Wait, but wait—classical electrodynamics can have issues. Like, the classical electron has problems with self-energy and infinite charge density. But in the classical framework, how are these handled? I think in classical physics, these infinities are problematic, but they aren't handled through regularization methods. Instead, perhaps you just accept them as limitations of the classical theory. But wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if regularization is a quantum field theory technique, then classical theories don't need it. So D, classical electrodynamics, doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But wait, the question is phrased as which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory isn't using quantum methods, then it doesn't use regularization.

Putting it all together: the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So, the options are A, B, C, which are quantum theories, and D, classical.

Quantum theories need regularization to handle divergences. So the only
