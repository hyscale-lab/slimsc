Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid, with four bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3. 

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. I think that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, but wait, with KOH, which is a strong base. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. When two vicinal (adjacent) bromides are treated with a strong base like KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Because we have two bromines on adjacent carbons, right? So when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, it would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3, making 1,3-adamantadiene. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh wait, adamantane's structure... Let me think. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So maybe 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, no, perhaps they are. Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a diene via elimination of two HBr molecules. So the product after KOH is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps 1,2-diene? Wait, no, the positions are 1 and 3. So elimination would form a conjugated diene. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid, so the structure is such that 1 and 3 are not adjacent, perhaps. So elimination of two HBr molecules would form a diene, perhaps between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? Or maybe just a single double bond? Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Oh no, wait, KOH and high temperature—maybe it's an E2 elimination, leading to a double bond.

But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. So what's the product when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with excess KOH? Alternatively, perhaps KOH is causing
