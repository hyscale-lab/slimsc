Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through it step by step, even though I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions. 

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage-shaped molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons. 

Heating this compound with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so this might be an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) are treated with a strong base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Wait, but in adamantane, the positions are 1 and 3, which are on different parts of the structure. So if they're not adjacent, maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond. But wait, 1 and 3 aren't adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's a Diels-Alder type scenario? No, wait, that's a different reaction. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a diene? Wait, but let's think about the product. The product is a light yellow solid, and the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. But wait, how? 

Wait, 1,3-dibromo adamantane with KOH. Another possibility is that each Br is on a carbon that's adjacent to a bridge. KOH could cause elimination, but if the two Br are not adjacent, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. If each bridgehead has a Br, when the base abstracts a hydrogen, perhaps two eliminations happen. Wait, but that would require each Br to have a hydrogen to eliminate with. Alternatively, maybe each Br is removed, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps each Br is in a position where elimination forms a double bond. But if the two Brs are too far apart, maybe it doesn't form a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe
