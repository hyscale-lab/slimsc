Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm. Let's try to think through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that the interplanar distance formula is something involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. 

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which means all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. Oh right, so a, b, c are all the same length. In this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So a = b = c = 10 Angstroms. And the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. 

The (111) plane means the Miller indices h=1, k=1, l=1. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h^2)(sin^2 alpha)/(sin^2 gamma) + ... )) Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I think the general formula is d = 1/√[(h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos beta) - 2(hl cos gamma) - 2(kl cos alpha)] multiplied by some factor? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up with something else.

Oh wait, maybe the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = [ (a² (h² +k² +l²) - 2 a² (hk cos(beta) + hl cos(gamma) + kl cos(alpha)) ) ]^(-1/2) )? Or maybe it's the reciprocal of the square root of something. 

Alternatively, I think I saw a formula that's d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) )) ), but wait, that doesn't seem right because in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so cos(theta) is zero, and it's just sqrt(h² +k² +l²) which
