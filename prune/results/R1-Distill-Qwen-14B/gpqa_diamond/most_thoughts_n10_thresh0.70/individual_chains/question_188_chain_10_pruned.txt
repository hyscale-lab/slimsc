Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, with some values around 9 or 10 Angstroms.

Wait, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula derived from the unit cell parameters. For a general crystal system, the formula is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... ) but wait, that's for cubic systems maybe. Oh wait, no, the general formula for any system uses the reciprocal of the product involving the Miller indices and the unit cell parameters.

Wait, another thought: The formula I'm thinking of is d = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + other terms involving the angles) all in the denominator under a square root, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, which is a special case where a = b = c and all angles are equal, there's a specific formula.

Wait, rhombohedral means that a = b = c, and all angles are the same. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The formula for interplanar spacing in such a crystal would be different from a cubic one.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by 1/d² = ( (h²)/(a²) ) + ( (k²)/(b²) ) + ( (l²)/(c²) ) ) + ... terms involving the cosines of the angles. But in the case of a rhombohedral system, with a = b = c and α = β = γ, the formula should simplify.

Oh right! The formula for a rhombohedral crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, since α=β=γ=30 degrees, and a=b=c, let's plug that in. For the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So substituting
