Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis is a reaction where the positions of substituents change, or where double bonds are redistributed. Oh right, ring-closing metathesis is when a diene forms a ring by connecting two ends with a metal catalyst, usually Grubbs catalyst or something similar.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that out. So cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 3,4 (both methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). Oh wait, cyclohexene's double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, I think. So numbering the ring, 1 is double-bonded to 2, then 3,4 have methyl groups, and 5 has isopropyl.

To form this via metathesis, I think we need a diene that, when the double bonds undergo metathesis, forms the cyclohexene ring. Metathesis usually breaks and reforms double bonds. So the starting material should be a diene that has the necessary substituents in positions that, when the ends meet, form the cyclohexene structure.

Wait, ring-closing metathesis forms a ring by connecting two ends of a diene. So the diene should have two double bonds that are connected. Wait, no, wait. No, metathesis
