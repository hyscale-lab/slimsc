Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator related to angular momentum. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh right, h is Planck's constant here. The matrix S is provided: the first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So let's write that down.

So, S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, Ay = c * S. Substituting c = h/(4π), so each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π). So Ay would be:

[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)     0     ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ -a      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)     -a    ]

The determinant of this is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/( (4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, what's (-i)(i)? Oh right, because i squared is -1. So (-i)(i) = - (i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - [1 * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ].

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0. Solving for a, a² = h²/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4π). Wait, no, because the square root of h²/(16 π²) is h/(4π), but we have a plus and minus. So eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Wait, but wait a second, wait. Because when I compute the determinant, I have a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0, right? Because the term is [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ] which is [ (-i^2) h²/(16 π²) ] = [ (1) h²/(16 π²) ] because i squared is -1, so negative of that is 1.

So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are positive and negative h/(4π). But wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±
