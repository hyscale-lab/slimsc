Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic substitution reaction when certain substituents are present on a benzene ring. The substances given are six different benzene derivatives, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. 

Hmm, I remember that the substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para. The more the substituent directs the incoming group to the para position, the higher the yield of the para-isomer.

So each substituent in the molecules 1-6 will influence where the bromine adds. Let me list the substituents for each:

1) С6H5-CH3 → methyl group (-CH3)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt)
3) C6H5-Cl → chlorine atom (-Cl)
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitro group (-NO2)
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethyl group (-C2H5)
6) C6H5-COOH → carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

Wait, right. The substituents are either activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing). Activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups make the ring less reactive and typically direct to meta positions.

Let me think about each substituent:

1. Methyl (-CH3): This is an activating group because the methyl is an electron-donating alkyl group. It's a strong activating group, so it directs the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions. Since it's bulky, perhaps the para position is more favored, but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe the para is more accessible? Or maybe the substituent's activating nature leads to more para product.

2. Ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt): This is a strong electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. It's deactivating. Wait, but the ethoxy part is an electron-donating group (OEt is EDG). Oh wait, no, the carbonyl is more dominant. So the overall effect is deactivating. So, this is a meta-directing group. So for substitution, the major product would be meta. So para would be minor, but wait, wait. Wait, no, the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, which is meta-directing. So in substitution, the incoming electrophile would add to the meta position. So the para isomer would be less in this case.

Wait, but wait. What's the substituent here? It's a carbonyl attached to an ethoxy group. So the structure is O-CO-OEt? Or wait, no, it's COOEt: the carbonyl is connected to an ethoxy. So the substituent is an ester group. So ester groups are electron-withdrawing by the carbonyl, but the OEt is an EDG through resonance. Wait, but the carbonyl is a strong EWG, so overall, the group is deactivating and meta-directing.

3. Chlorine (-Cl): Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's an electron-withdrawing group because of its electronegativity, but it's also ortho/para-directing. Wait, but wait, chlorine is a deactivating group but ortho/para-directing because of its lone pairs. So it's a meta director for some substituents? No, wait, no. Wait, chlorine is a deactivating group (due to electron withdrawal by inductive effect), but it's ortho/para-directing because of the lone pairs which can donate electrons through
