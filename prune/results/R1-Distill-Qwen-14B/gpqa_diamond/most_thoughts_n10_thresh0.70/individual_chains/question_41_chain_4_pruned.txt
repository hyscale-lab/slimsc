Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Oh, right, because the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So how do these motions combine?

I remember that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, the speed of light in that medium isn't just the regular speed (which is c/n) because the medium's motion affects the light's motion. But wait, is this a case where I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula or something else?

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n. But that's the speed in the medium's rest frame. Now, since the medium is moving, we have to consider the observer's frame. So perhaps I should think about how the light's velocity transforms when the medium is moving.

Wait, the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, what's the observed speed of the light?

Hmm, normally, if the medium is stationary, light moves at c/n. But when the medium is moving, I think the light's speed doesn
