Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in this case, the speed should be 1/n since c is taken as 1 here. But wait, the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed of light inside it?

Oh, right! There's the concept of relative velocity here. But wait, how does that apply? Because the glass is moving, but the light is already inside the glass. I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

I think when the medium is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame isn't simply v = c/n. Because in the lab frame, the medium is moving, so the light's velocity would be affected by the medium's motion. Or is it?

Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium depends on the properties of the medium, but its direction and speed relative to the medium would be v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, we have to consider how the light's velocity adds up with the medium's velocity. Wait, but special relativity comes into play here. Oh, right, because light speed is constant in all inert
