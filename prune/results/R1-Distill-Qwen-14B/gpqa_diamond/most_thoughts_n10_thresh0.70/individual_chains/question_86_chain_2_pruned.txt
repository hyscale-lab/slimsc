Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves two reactions where a chemist used two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. I need to determine what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that reducing agents like LiBH4 and BH3 are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can reduce ketones, but wait, sometimes in specific conditions like maybe in THF or something. BH3, on the other hand, I think is used in the formation of alcohols from ketones or aldehydes, but wait, isn't BH3 typically used in the hydroboration-oxidation reactions? Oh right, hydroboration follows anti-Markovnikov addition. Oh wait, but wait, in this context, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone. Wait, but if the starting material is a ketone and they're using a reducing agent... Oh wait, wait, maybe the starting materials are esters or something that can be reduced to form the ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone being formed from some other structure. 

Let me think again. The product is a cyclic ketone. Let's imagine the structure. The IUPAC name is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, right. The numbering would have the oxygen at position 1, then the ketone at position 2. The ethyl group is at position 4.

Wait, pyran-2-one is like a cyclic ketone, so the ring is a five-membered ring? No, wait, no. Pyran is a six-membered ring, right. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring with the oxygen and a ketone at position 2. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with O at position 1, and a ketone (C=O) at position 2. The substituents would be ethyl at position 4.

Wait, but how does that form from the starting material? Let me think about the reactions.

In the first reaction, compound A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give the (R) product. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide opening? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the product is a ketone. So if the starting material is an ester, then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to a diol, but that doesn't lead to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone that's already in a ring, but that doesn't make sense because then why would you reduce it further.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an epoxide. No, LiBH4 isn't typically used for opening epoxides. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde or ketone that's being reduced, but that wouldn't form another ketone. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, like lactones. If you reduce a lactone with LiBH4, maybe you get a diol? But the product is a ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Wait a minute, another thought: maybe the starting materials are some kind of acetal or ketal. But wait, LiBH4 is used to reduce ketals? Not sure. Or perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but again, I don't think LiBH4 would open epoxides to form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction of a carbonyl group to form an alcohol, but with specific conditions. Wait, but the product is a ketone, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are not carbonyl compounds. Maybe they're something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: look at the options given. The options are A and B, which are both (S) or (R) forms of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents. Structure-wise, it's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure would be
