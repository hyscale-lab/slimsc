Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' or 'plx', right? So the equation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. 

I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by parallax. So d = 1/plx. That means plx is proportional to 1/d. So if plx is inversely proportional to d, then plx^5 would be inversely proportional to d^5. Wait, let me make that clear. 

So if plx = 1/d, then plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/(d^5). So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. Oh wait, wait! The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since 1/plx^5 is d^5, that would make N proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r (with thickness dr) would be the number per unit volume multiplied by the volume of that shell. Oh, right, the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. But wait, wait. Wait, the number of stars isn't directly about volume, but about how the count varies as you look further out. 

Wait no, the problem says it's a specific region of the sky, so maybe we're considering a thin slice or a thin shell. So if N is proportional to d^5, then per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^5. Wait, no. Let me think again. 

Wait, the number of stars in a given region is linked to the density of stars in that region. So if the density is such that N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because I thought that as you go further, there are fewer stars
