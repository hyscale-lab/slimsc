Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. The solution is made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. And I have four options to choose from. The question is about finding the pH of the resulting solution.

Wait a second, mixing HCl and Ba(OH)2... those are strong acid and strong base, right? So they should neutralize each other. But what about the acetic acid? Oh, right, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. So maybe the first thing I should do is figure out the moles of each acid and base and see if there's any excess after neutralization.

Let's break it down. I'll calculate the moles for each of the three solutions.

First, for the acetic acid (CH3COOH). The formula is CH3COOH, so molar mass is 60.05 g/mol, but wait, I probably don't need the mass because I can just calculate moles using Molarity = moles/volume. Oh right, because moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

So for CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so not all of it will dissociate, but maybe in this case, after mixing with HCl and Ba(OH)2, I'll have to see what's left.

Next, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2: Hmm, the formula is Ba(OH)2. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So the moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles. But wait, no, I think I should calculate the moles of OH- first. So yes, 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 × 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, the key is to see if the acids and bases will neutralize each other. The HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. They'll react completely. So the H+ from HCl will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Let's calculate which one is in excess.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So when they react, the H+ will be used up first. How much OH- will be left?

The moles of OH- after reaction: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Since OH- is in excess, the solution will be basic. But wait, what about the acetic acid? Because acetic acid is a weak acid, and if there's excess OH- around, it will react with it.

So, the OH- will first neutralize the weak acid. Let's think about that.

The acetic acid (CH3COOH) will donate H+ when it reacts with OH-. The OH- is a strong base, so it will take H+ from the acetic acid.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. So when OH- is added, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. The OH- is a strong base, so it will react completely with the acetic acid.

So the moles of OH- after reacting with HCl is 0.10. Now, how much acetic acid is present? It's
