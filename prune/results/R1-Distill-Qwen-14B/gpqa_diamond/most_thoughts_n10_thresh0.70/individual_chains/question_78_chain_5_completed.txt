Okay, so I have this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). At some earlier time tr, the charge was at a position such that the vector from there to the observation point r is d. The velocity at the generating time tr is v.

I remember that when a charge is moving, it not only produces electric fields but also magnetic fields. The potentials, V and A, are related to these fields through Maxwell's equations.

Wait, the scalar potential V is usually due to the electric field, and the vector potential A is due to the magnetic field. For a static charge, V would be (q)/(4πε₀ r), right? But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativistic effects or maybe just the retarded time considerations.

The options given have different expressions. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: V is static, (q)/(4πε₀ r), and A is v squared over c² times V. That seems odd because A should involve velocity, but v squared? I'm not sure.

Option B: V is the same, and A is v over c² times V. Hmm, this makes sense dimensionally because velocity has units of m/s, c² is (m²/s²), so v/c² would be 1/s, but A is a vector potential, which has units of Tesla·m²/s²? Or wait, A has units of Weber/(meter) which is T·m. Let me think: [v] is m/s, [c²] is m²/s². So v/c² is 1/s. Hmm, V has units of volts (J/C), which is kg·m²/(C·s²). Let me see: (v/c²) * V would be (1/s) * (kg·m²/(C·s²)) )= kg·m²/(C·s³). What's the unit of A? A is in Tesla·meter², and Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so A has units (kg/(s²·A)) * m² = kg·m²/(A·s²). Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe option B is not correct. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - d·v)), and A is (μo qc v)/(4π (dc - d·v)). The denominator looks like dc minus the dot product of d and v. dc is the product of d (which is a vector's magnitude) and c, which is a speed. And the dot product d·v would have units of m²/s. So the denominator is a scalar, which makes sense for the potential.

Wait, but why would the denominator be dc - d·v? Let me think about the retarded time. The retarded time tr is the time it takes for the fields to propagate from the charge's position to the observation point. So the distance between the charge at tr and the field point r is d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So the distance is |d| = r - (v * (t - tr))? Because the charge is moving, so the distance at time t would be different. Wait, maybe not exactly, but in any case, the denominator probably involves c multiplied by the time difference, which is (t - tr). Since d is the vector from the charge's position to r, then |d| is the distance at time tr. The speed of light times (t - tr) would be the distance the field travels in that time. So the denominator might be |d| * c - (d · v) because d is the vector from charge to r. So (d · v) would be |d| * |v| * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between d and v. So the denominator is d*c - (d · v) = c |d| - |d| |v| cos(theta) = |d| [ c - v cos(theta) ].

Wait, that looks similar to option C's denominator. So V would be (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)).

And for the vector potential A, the expression is (μ0 qc v )/(4π (d c - d·v)). Hmm, I'm not sure, but let's think about the form of the potentials.

I remember that the vector potential for a moving charge can be written as A = (μ0 q/(4π)) (v × something) ) / (c^2 something). Wait, more accurately, the vector potential due to a moving charge is given by A = (μ0 q)/(4π c²) [ (v × (r' - r)) / |r' - r|^3 ] ... Wait, wait, but here r' is the charge's position at time tr, and r is the field point. So the vector from the charge to the field point is d, so A would involve (v × d) / |d|³ multiplied by (μ0 q)/(4π c²).

Alternatively, another approach is to recall that the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's velocity. The scalar potential might not just depend on the static term because the charge is moving, but I'm not sure. Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge could have a term involving the velocity, but I think in the static case, V is (q)/(4πε0 r), but when the charge is moving, the scalar potential might involve a term that accounts for the relativistic effects or the motion.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given in terms of the velocity and the distance. Another thought: the potentials are often expressed as retarded potentials. The scalar potential V is (q)/(4πε0) multiplied by 1/(r - (v t)), but more accurately, considering the time delay. Hmm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions.

Wait, the general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / ( |d| - v· (d/|d| ) ) * (1 - (v²)/(c²)) ) ] ?

Wait, no, perhaps the correct expressions involve the denominator as (d·(1 - (v/c))) or something like that. Alternatively, the denominator is (d c - d·v), which matches option C.

So, for the scalar potential, I think it's (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), which is option C's V. And for the vector potential, it would be (μ₀ q v )/(4π (d c - d·v)), which is option C's A.

Wait, but why is there a c in the numerator for V? Because I thought V would be similar to the static case but scaled by some factor due to motion. Oh, right, when the charge is moving, there's a term involving the velocity in the denominator, which affects the potential. So that's why V has a c in the numerator. 

Option C's V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - d·v)), which looks correct. And the vector potential is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (dc - d·v)), which makes sense because vector potential is proportional to velocity and has factors of μ₀.

Looking at the other options again, option D has (dc + d·v) in the denominator. That doesn't seem right because, considering the charge moving away, you'd have a longer distance, so the denominator should be (dc - something). So option C is more likely correct.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves along a trajectory \( \vec{s}(t) \), and the observation point is \( \vec{r} \). The vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \). The potentials are influenced by the motion of the charge and must account for relativistic effects or retarded time considerations.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   This option assumes the scalar potential \( V \) is static, which is incorrect for a moving charge. Additionally, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) involves \( \vec{v^2} \), which is dimensionally inconsistent with the expected form of \( \vec{A} \). This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_o r} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \).  
   While the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) has the correct dependence on \( \vec{v} \) and \( c^2 \), the scalar potential \( V \) is again static, which is not valid for a moving charge. This option is also incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   The denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) correctly accounts for the retarded time and the motion of the charge. The scalar potential \( V \) includes a factor of \( c \) in the numerator, which is consistent with the relativistic effects of a moving charge. The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v} \) and has the correct dependence on \( \mu_o \) and \( c \). This option is consistent with the expected form of the potentials for a moving charge.

4. **Option D**:  
   \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \).  
   The denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is problematic because it does not correctly account for the retarded time or the motion of the charge. The addition of \( \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) would lead to an incorrect expression for the potentials. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**, as they properly account for the motion of the charge and the retarded time effects.

**Answer: C**
