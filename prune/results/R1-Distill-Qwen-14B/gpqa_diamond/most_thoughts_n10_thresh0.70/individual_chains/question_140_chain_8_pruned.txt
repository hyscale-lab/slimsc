Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. When a precipitate G is formed, heating it releases something called B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. 

Another part says that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So X is probably a common reagent.

Hmm, first, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So for a molecule, the total number of protons equals the total neutrons across all atoms. Wait, no, each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps each atom? Wait, the problem says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, wait, that's for each molecule. So each molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons in total.

Wait, that seems a bit tricky. Let me think of possible gases. For example, H2O would have 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons in the common isotope). So total protons are 10, neutrons 8. Not equal. So that's not it. What about CH4? Protons: 4 (from C) + 4 (H) = 8. Neutrons: C has 6, so 6 + 4 (H) =10. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's NH3. Let's see: N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons (common isotope is N-14, which has 7 neutrons). Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So one molecule of NH3: 7 +3 =10 protons, 7 +0=7 neutrons. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe CO2? C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So 6 + 16 =22 protons. O has 8 each, so 16 neutrons from two O. So protons 22, neutrons 16. Not same.

Wait, maybe O2? Each
