Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

Let me start by looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1, both medium to strong intensity. Those are typically indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, the compound also has a strong band at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the compound likely has a carbonyl group, which could be from an amide, ester, ketone, or maybe a formamide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: That would have an amide group, so a carbonyl, and an ethoxy group. The ethoxy would show up in the NMR as a triplet probably around 1-2 ppm for the CH2CH3, but let's see.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide has a structure where the amide is connected to a formyl group. So, I think this would have a formyl (CHO) attached. The IR would show the C=O from the amide and the N-H from the formamide group.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Propionate is a carboxylic acid ester. So, the ester group would have a carbonyl, and the amine would have N-H. But wait, if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, would the amine be free or as an ammonium? Probably as a free amine, so it would show N-H peaks in IR.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This is an ester. The benzoate would have a carbonyl, and the amine group on the benzene ring. The ester would have the ethoxy group.

So, the IR has two N-H or O-H peaks. Wait, but amides typically have N-H stretches. Let me think: if there's a primary amide, the N-H would show up around 3300-3500 cm^-1, maybe two peaks for the two N-H groups in a primary amide. Alternatively, if it's an amine, like in D, the primary amine would have N-H stretches around there as well.

The strong peak at 1720 is probably an ester or amide carbonyl. Amide carbonyls are usually around 1650-1700, but can vary. Esters are around 1720-1750. So the 1720 is more likely an ester. Hmm, but benzamides can vary. Let me consider each option.

Let's move on to the 1H NMR data.
