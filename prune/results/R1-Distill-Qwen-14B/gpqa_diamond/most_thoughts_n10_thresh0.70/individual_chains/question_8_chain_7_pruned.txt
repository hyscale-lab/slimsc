Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the scenario is about finding genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. They have three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each and some double mutants. The experiment tests the resistance of these mutants to the fungus. 

The data they got is about the resistance percentage compared to the wild-type control. The higher the percentage, the more resistant. So, when the resistance is 0%, the plants are very susceptible.

Looking at the results:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So, less than wild type but still some resistance.
- g2 has 0%. So, no resistance at all.
- g3 has 50%. So, half the resistance.
- The double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% resistance. That's really low.
  - g2g3: 0%.
  - g1g2: 0%.

And the question is about the interaction of these genes. The options are A to D, each making different claims about which is a transcription factor, if there's pleiotropy or gene redundancy, and which gene is epistatic to another.

First, I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the presence of a certain allele in A masks the effect of gene B.

Also, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are usually regulators; they activate or repress other genes.

The data:

g2 knockout has 0% resistance. That's very low. So, G2 is probably critical for resistance. If a plant can't produce G2, it's completely susceptible. So, G2 might be a transcription factor because without it, the downstream genes can't be activated.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 has 0%, which is the same as g2 alone. So, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1, because the absence of G2 masks the effect of G1's presence or absence. Because even if G1 is present, without G2, resistance is gone. So, G2's function is upstream of G1. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, no. Wait, in epistasis, the gene that is epistatic is the one that acts downstream. Because the downstream gene's product is needed for the pathway. So, if G2 is a transcription factor, it activates G1 or other genes. So, without G2, those downstream genes can't function, making the plant very susceptible.

But in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, the effect of G1's knockout is not adding anything beyond G2's knockout. So, the presence of G1 doesn't matter if G2 is knocked out. So, this suggests G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's function is upstream, and G1 is downstream. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

So, that's one point: G2 is epistatic to G1.

Looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is worse than either alone (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). Wait, but 10% is way lower than either. Hmm. That's strange. Maybe the functions of G1 and G3 are additive, but when both are missing, the effect is more severe.

Wait, but in the double mutant g2g3, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, the double mutant doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. So, when G2 is knocked out, adding G3 knockout doesn't change the resistance. So, perhaps G2 is in a pathway upstream of G3 as well.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single knockouts. So, maybe G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in a redundant way, and when both are missing, the resistance drops more.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So, each contributes some resistance, and together they add up. But when both are knocked out, resistance is lower than either.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10
