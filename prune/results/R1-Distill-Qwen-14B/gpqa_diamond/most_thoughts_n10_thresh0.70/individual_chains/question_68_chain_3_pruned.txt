Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think about what's being asked. The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and then it's suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of a particle aligns with it, right? So when the initial field is along Z, the particle's magnetic moment is along Z too. But when the field switches to Y, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, so it starts to precess or oscillate.

Wait, the problem says the average of the z-component oscillates. So I need to think about how the expectation value of Sz changes over time when the system's Hamiltonian changes.

The initial state is when the magnetic field is along Z. The particle is in an eigenstate of Sz, either up or down. Let's say it's in the eigenstate |+z> because it's aligned with B. So the initial state is |+z>.

Now, when the magnetic field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. Before, the Hamiltonian was H_initial proportional to Sz, and after, H_final is proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic moment is gamma Sz, the Hamiltonian would be proportional to -mu·B, but since mu is gamma Sz, then H_initial was something like -gamma B Sz. But I think the exact form might not matter as much as the form of the new Hamiltonian.

Wait, the general form for the Hamiltonian when a magnetic field is applied along a direction is H = - gamma B S . n, where n is the direction vector. So when the field is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y. But maybe the sign doesn't matter because energy differences are what matter in transitions.

The time evolution of the system will now be governed by the new Hamiltonian H = ω S_y, where ω is some frequency. Wait, what's the expression for the Hamiltonian in terms of spin matrices? Let me think: the spin components S_x, S_y, S_z have matrix representations. For spin-1/2, S_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], S_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], and S_z is (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the new Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. Let me express it as H = (gamma B) S_y. Wait, because mu = gamma S_z, so the magnetic moment is gamma times S_z. The energy is -mu · B, so H = - mu · B = - gamma S_z B. But wait, in the initial state, the field was along Z, so H was proportional to S_z. After the change, it's along Y, so H becomes proportional to S_y.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is given by ω = gamma B. So when the field is along Z, the system precesses with frequency ω = gamma B. But when the field is along Y, the precession is around Y, so how does that affect the expectation value of Sz?

Wait, the problem is about the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z = gamma <Sz>. So the average mu_z oscillates, and we're to find the frequency of that oscillation.

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. After the Hamiltonian changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate. So the state will evolve under H = something proportional to S_y.

Let me think about the time evolution. The time-dependent state will be |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

But let's compute the expectation value of Sz. So <Sz> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>. Because S_z has a time dependence through the state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the Heisenberg picture, where the operator evolves with H. The equation for the time evolution of an operator A is dA/dt = (i/ħ) [H, A].

So the operator Sz(t) = exp(i H t / ħ) S_z exp(-i H t / ħ).

So let's compute the commutator [H, S_z]. H is proportional to S_y. So H = ω S_y, where ω is gamma B, perhaps. Let's say ω = gamma B.

Wait, no, actually, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. Hmm, because the energy is - mu · B, and mu = gamma S_z, so H = - (gamma S_z) · B. But when the field is along Y, H = - gamma B S_y. Wait, no, wait: the direction is Y, so H should be proportional to S_y.

Wait, perhaps I should write H as H = ω S_y, where ω is gamma B. Wait, but the actual expression for H is H = - gamma B S_y. Hmm, perhaps I should consider the sign, but in any case, it's proportional to S_y.

So H = ω S_y, with ω = gamma B.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is E = -mu·B. So mu is gamma S_z, so E = - gamma S_z B. That's when the field is along Z. But when it's along Y, E = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, that can't be right because S_y has units of ħ/2. Oh wait, no, wait: S is in units of ħ, so when multiplied by gamma (which has units of (rad/s)/(Tesla)), the product gamma B would have units of rad/s. So H is proportional to gamma B S_y. But perhaps the actual Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. Hmm, but the sign might not matter for the frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the correct Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y, but I think I might have that wrong. Let me think about the correct expression.

Wait, actually, the
