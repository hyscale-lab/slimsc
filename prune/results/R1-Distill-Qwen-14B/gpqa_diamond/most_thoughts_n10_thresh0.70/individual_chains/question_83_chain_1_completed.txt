Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. They want the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I'll break it down. So, when you dilute a solution, you change the concentration. Let me calculate the new concentration after adding water.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and the initial concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2, where C1 is initial concentration, V1 initial volume, and C2 and V2 after dilution.

So, 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = C2 * 40 cm³. Let's compute that. 0.05 *20 = 1, so 1 = C2 *40 → C2 = 1/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, during titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? I think it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to find the equivalence point first.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid initially are volume * concentration. The volume is 40 cm³ (since we diluted it). Wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 liters = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Then, when diluted with 20 cm³, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), but the moles of acetic acid remain the same because no reaction has occurred yet.

Wait, but when you dilute, you're not changing the moles, just the concentration. So moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) is = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

When titrated with NaOH, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence = 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume V for equivalence is moles / concentration → 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, 25% titration means 25% of the equivalence volume, so 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

I need to find the pH at this point and at the equivalence point.

Let's first tackle the 25% titration point.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, since we have 0.001 mol of acetic acid initially, after adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ let's calculate. 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(Ka). Ka is given as 1.85e-5.

Let me calculate pKa: log(1.85e-5) is approximately... Let's compute log(1.85) which is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is about 4.733.

Henderson equation: pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Rounded, about 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26. Option D's first is 4.57, which is higher.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations. Let me recompute the concentrations.

Wait, moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.0058824 M.

So ratio is 0.0058824 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.33333, yes. So log of 0.333 is -0.4771.

pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 = 4.2559, so approximately 4.26. So the first pH is around 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but what about the second part? The equivalence point pH. Let me think.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is sodium acetate, a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will be basic.

The concentration of acetate will determine the pH. Also, since we have to account for dilution.

At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol, which equals the moles of acetic acid.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

The concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the expression for Kb.

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. So:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ Kb.

But since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11.

Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ ?

Log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is (0.017 -5) → -4.983. So pOH is 4.983, so pH is 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, but wait a minute. That would imply a pH around 9.02, but none of the options have a value like that. Options A, B, C, D's second values are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92.

Wait, did I make a mistake? Because I think I messed up the Kb calculation.

Wait, the Kb is Kw/Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, Kw is 1e-14. So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10. That seems correct.

Wait, but solution volume is 50 cm³, so 0.05 L, and moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.02 M. That's correct.

So the calculation leads to [OH^-] about 1.04e-5 M. So pOH is about 4.98, pH ≈9.02. But the options don’t have this. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the steps.

Wait, perhaps I should not have approximated. Let's solve the quadratic equation without approximation.

Set up: x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

So, x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).

Expanding: x² = 1.081e-11 -5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to left: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a)

Where a =1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11) → approx (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2).

We take the positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈3.288e-6 M. pOH is -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517 → pOH=5.483. So pH is 14 -5.483 ≈8.517. Which is about 8.52.

Wait, that's more in line with option A's second value of 8.52. But earlier, when I approximated, I had a higher pH. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because when I assumed x was negligible, I used 0.02 - x ≈0.02, which might not be accurate. The x I found earlier (1.04e-5) is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 0.02 M), so the approximation should hold. But when I actually did the quadratic, I got a higher x. Wait, no, no.

Wait, my first approximation gave x ≈1.04e-5 → pOH≈4.98, pH≈9.02.

But the quadratic gave x≈3.288e-6 → pOH≈5.48, pH≈8.52.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because x is supposed to be about 3.288e-6 in the quadratic, which is smaller than 1e-5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate the quadratic.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac. Wait, no: D = b² -4ac.

Wait, D = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

Compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 → 29.214e-20 → 2.9214e-19.

4ac =4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. But since c is negative, D becomes (2.9214e-19) + (4.324e-11).

Wait, 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19. So D ≈4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D) ≈6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ]/(2).

Taking positive solution: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approx (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → let me compute that.

Log(3.288) is about 0.517. So log(3.288e-6) is 0.517 -6 → -5.483.

So pOH is 5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517, which rounds to 8.52.

So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I made the approximation, I got a pH of around 9.02, which is wrong. So the correct pH is about 8.52.

So now, putting it all together: At 25% titration (2.5 cm³ NaOH added), pH is about 4.26. At equivalence, pH is 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. That's exactly what I found. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option B is 3.17 and 6.73. That can't be right because at equivalence, the pH should be higher than 7, but option B's second value is 6.73. So that's unlikely.

Wait, but wait. Alternative approach: Maybe I've made a mistake in the initial calculations for the 25% titration point.

Wait, another way: At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point (which is 10 cm³), so 2.5 cm³. Moles of NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.05 M *0.02 L=0.001 mol.

After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH]=0.00075 /0.0425=0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.0058824 M.

Henderson equation: pH= pKa + log ( [A-]/[HA] )

pKa is 4.733.

Ratio is 0.0058824/0.017647=0.33333.

Log(0.3333)= -0.4771.

So pH=4.733 -0.4771=4.2559 ≈4.26.

That seems right.

So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26; at equivalence, pH is 8.52 → option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, containing **0.001 moles** of acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Since the moles of acetic acid are 0.001, and the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH required is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{moles of NaOH}}{\text{concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At **25% titration**, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10 cm³) is added, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \cdot 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the ratio:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.3333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the **equivalence point**, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. The total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.02 \), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving:

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 \approx 1.081 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.983.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation without approximation gives a more accurate result:

\[
x^2 + 5.405 \times 10^{-10}x - 1.081 \times 10^{-11} = 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \), and \( c = -1.081 \times 10^{-11} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52.**
