Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least ħ/2. Or was it ħ? Let me think. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or maybe I'm mixing this up with something else. Oh, no, wait, I think it's ħ over two, but sometimes people use the approximation without the ½ factor. Hmm.

So the idea is that the shorter the lifetime (Δt) of a state, the less precisely we can know its energy. Because a shorter Δt implies a larger uncertainty ΔE, right? So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, their energies would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, wait no, wait. The two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps each state has a certain uncertainty in energy. But we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1, let's say ΔE = E2 - E1. We need this ΔE to be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Hmm, but how exactly do the lifetimes relate to the energy uncertainty? Oh, right, the lifetime is the time for which the state exists, and the uncertainty in time is related to the lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately inversely proportional to the lifetime. So shorter lifetime means larger energy uncertainty.

So for state 1, with lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 would be about ħ/(2 τ1). Similarly, for state 2, τ2 = 1e-8, so ΔE2 is ħ/(2 τ2). But since τ2 is ten times larger than τ1, the uncertainty for state 2 is smaller. So the critical factor here is the uncertainty of the shorter-lived state because that's the larger one.

Wait, but to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of their
