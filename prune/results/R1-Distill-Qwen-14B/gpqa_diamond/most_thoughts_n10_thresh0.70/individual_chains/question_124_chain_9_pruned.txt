Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, one-third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, I think the key here is time dilation affecting how much time they have to reach the detector's walls before decaying.

Wait, the problem says these are fast-decaying particles. So their lifetime is very short in the lab frame. But from their own rest frame, their lifetime is longer. Oh wait, no, in their rest frame, their lifetime is the proper time. But in the lab frame, moving at a high velocity, their lifetime is dilated by gamma.

So the particles are produced at the center of the detector. They move outward, and some of them decay before reaching the inner walls. The fraction that makes it depends on how much time they have before decaying. If they have enough time to reach the wall, they survive; otherwise, they decay.

So the proper lifetime of the particle is tau (tau_0). In the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma * tau_0. The time it takes for them to reach the wall is the distance divided by their speed. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately c. So the time to reach the wall is t = R / c = 30 m / (3e8 m/s). Let me calculate that. 30 divided by 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds or 0.1 microseconds. Wait, 3e8 is 300 million, so 30/(3e8) is 1e-7? Wait, 30 /3e8 is 1e-7, yes.

So the proper time for the particle to reach the wall is tau = t / gamma. Because in the particle's frame, the distance is contracted. Oh wait, wait. From the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma tau. The time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c), but since beta is approximately 1 for ultra-relativistic speeds, t â‰ˆ R/(c). So the condition is that the particle's lifetime must be greater than t. So gamma tau > t.

Wait, no. Because the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So for the particle to reach the wall, gamma tau must be greater than t. So gamma >= t/(tau). So the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on how much gamma exceeds t/tau.

Wait, but in the given scenario, at gamma=20, one-third reach the wall. We need to find gamma_new such that two-thirds reach the wall. So the fraction increases as gamma increases because more particles have gamma tau > t.

Wait,
