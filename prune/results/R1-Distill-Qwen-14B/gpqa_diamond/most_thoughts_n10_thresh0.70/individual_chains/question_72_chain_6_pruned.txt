Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1.

Next, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, that's quite a chain of reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I think I should figure out each reaction's outcome. Let's start with the first step.

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide is often used in elimination or substitution reactions, especially SN2. But given the other reactants, perhaps it's a coupling reaction?

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo structure with a tert-butoxy group. The other reactant, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons. So, each of those has two Br atoms. So each of those groups is like CH2Br2.

Wait, when you have dibromomethyl groups, like CH2Br2, and you have a base or something that can cause elimination, perhaps this is a coupling reaction. I remember that sometimes when you have vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens on the same carbon), they can undergo elimination to form alkenes, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening here.

Alternatively, when two molecules with adjacent dihalide groups react with a diene, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Wait, but the starting material is a diene. Oh wait, the initial compound is a bicycloheptadiene, which is a conjugated diene, I think.

Wait, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The structure is a norbornene-like system. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. So this starting material is a diene, with the substituent at position 7 being a tert-butoxy group.

The other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, cyclohexadiene with two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being CH2Br2.

Hmm. When you have two equivalents of this dihalide, perhaps each equivalent can react with the diene in a Diels-Alder-like reaction. But wait, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalides are undergoing some elimination or substitution.

Wait, sodium iodide (NaI) is a good source of I- ions. In substitution reactions, I- can act as a nucleophile. But in this case, perhaps it's more about the elimination. Alternatively, maybe a coupling reaction where the dihalide is acting as a dienophile.

Wait, another thought: when you have a dihalide (e.g., 1,2-dibromoethane) and a diene, under certain conditions, they can undergo a coupling reaction, such as a (2+4) cycloaddition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is reacting via an elimination to form a dienophile.

Wait, maybe each of these dibromomethyl groups can lose HBr to form a double bond. So, each CH2Br2 could lose two HBr molecules to become CH2. But wait, if each CH2Br2 loses two HBr, that would form CH2, but that's a single bond. Alternatively, if each CH2Br2 loses HBr once, you get CHBr. But perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, the dihalide, when treated with a base, can eliminate to form a double bond. So maybe each CH2Br2 group becomes CH2Br and then eliminates to form a double bond? Wait, but each group is already CH2Br2. Let me think: if each CH2Br2 group is subjected to elimination, perhaps they lose HBr and form a double bond between the two carbons. So each CH2Br2 would lose two Br and form a double bond. Wait, but that's not possible because each CH2Br2 has two Brs on the same carbon. So for elimination, you need adjacent Brs on adjacent carbons. Oh wait, the dihalide is in positions 5 and 6 on the cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the structure is cyclohexadiene with substituents at 5 and 6 being CH2Br2.

Wait, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, which means that the two CH2Br2 groups are on adjacent carbons (5 and 6). So perhaps each of these can lose HBr to form a double bond. So each CH2Br2 would lose two HBr molecules, but wait, that would require each CH2Br2 to have two H's to lose. But CH2Br2 has two Brs and two Hs. So each CH2Br2 can lose two HBr molecules, which would form a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So each CH2Br2 would become CH2, but that's not a double bond. Wait, maybe adjacent CH2Br2 groups can eliminate to form a double bond between carbons 5 and 6.

Wait, if you have two CH2Br2 groups on adjacent carbons (5 and 6), perhaps each can lose HBr, leading to a double bond between C5 and C6. So each CH2Br2 would lose one HBr each, but since they're adjacent, the Brs could be on adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond.

Wait, let me try to visualize this. The cyclohexadiene has double bonds at 1,3. So the structure is a six-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. At positions 5 and 6 (which are adjacent in the ring), there are CH2Br2 substituents.

So when treated with NaI and elevated temperature, maybe the CH2Br2 groups undergo elimination. Each CH2Br2 could lose two HBr molecules, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling between the diene and the dihalide. The starting material is a diene, and the other is a dihalide which may act as a dienophile.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let
