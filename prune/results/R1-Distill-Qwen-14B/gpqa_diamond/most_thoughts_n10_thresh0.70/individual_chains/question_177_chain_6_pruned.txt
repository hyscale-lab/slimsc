Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass is 1.5 times larger too. Hmm, but wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? Oh right, I remember that luminosity depends on both radius and temperature, but mass might not be directly proportional. Oh wait, maybe the mass relates to the radius in the context of how they're formed or something else, but I'm not sure. Let's focus on the given data.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I think that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is determined by its temperature. I remember from Wien's Law that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature. Oh wait, that's right! Wien's Law is λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is the same for both, then T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Oh, that's an important point. So T_1 = T_2. Because their peak wavelengths are the same. So that simplifies things.

Now, the question is about the luminosity. The luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since we're assuming they're black bodies, this should apply.

So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both, the luminosity ratio will be (R1/R2)².

Wait, the question says that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But T1 = T2, so (T1/T2)^4 = 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. That would suggest the factor is 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, let me read the problem again. Oh! The question mentions
