Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question gives me their radii and masses, and some other data about their luminosities and velocities. I need to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, let me jot down the given information:

- Radius of Star_1 (R1) = 1.5 * Radius of Star_2 (R2). So R1 = 1.5 R2.
- Mass of Star_1 (M1) = 1.5 * Mass of Star_2 (M2). So M1 = 1.5 M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest (their peak emission wavelengths) are the same. That probably relates to their temperatures.
- Radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Not sure how that comes into play yet.
- The stars are modeled as black bodies, so their luminosity should follow the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The question is about the ratio of their luminosities, L1/L2.

Hmm, Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since it's a ratio, the 4πσ will cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 is 1.5 R2, so that part will be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So without considering temperature, the R part is 2.25. But temperature is another factor.

Wait, the peak wavelengths are the same. The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.898e-3 m·K). So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures should be the same. So T1 = T2. So the T part would be (T1/T2)^4 = 1. So L1/L2 would just be 2.25? That would point to option A.

Wait, but wait. There's radial velocities involved. Oh, right, because velocity can affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh! So the observed wavelengths are affected by the star's velocity relative to us.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So they observed the same λ for both stars. But due to the Doppler effect, the actual emitted wavelengths might differ.

Wait a second, let me think. Let me clarify this: the peak emission wavelength is the same as observed. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars.

But for Star_2, it's moving towards or away from us at 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is 700 km/s. If radial velocity is positive, it's moving away (redshift), if negative, moving towards (blueshift). But the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 has no velocity, so its observed λ is the same as emitted. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s? Wait, but which direction? Does it matter? Let me see.

Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 has radial velocity zero, so λ1 observed is λ1 emitted
