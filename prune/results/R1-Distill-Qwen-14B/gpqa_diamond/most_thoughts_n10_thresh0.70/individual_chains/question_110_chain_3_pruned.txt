Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. So the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go up to 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh, wait, magnitude scales are a bit tricky. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's lower than 17. So the detectable range for ESPRESSO is V ≤ 17. Similarly, for HIRES, it's V ≤16. Because anything brighter than 16 is magnitude less than or equal to 16.

So the key is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 because that's what HIRES can see, and also ≤17 for ESPRESSO. But wait, no. Wait, because ESPRESSO can observe stars up to 17 mag, meaning it can detect stars as faint as 17, but not beyond. HIRES can go up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES can't see fainter than 16. So both spectrographs can detect it if it's <=16.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. The question states that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means M_V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe M_V <16. So any star with M_V less than 16 can be seen by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's certainly brighter than 17, so both can see it. But some stars might be between 16 and 17, which ESPRESSO can see but HIRES can't. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16.

So now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which ones are ≤16. Also, some stars have E(B-V) given, which suggests interstellar extinction, so their apparent magnitudes are affected. Oh right, because interstellar dust causes extinction, making stars appear dimmer and redder. So their observed magnitudes are higher (fainter) than their intrinsic.

The formula I remember is: apparent magnitude = absolute magnitude + distance modulus + extinction. Or wait, let's think in terms of distance modulus and extinction.

The formula is: m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5 + A_V
Wait, extinction A_V is related to E(B-V). The problem states that the total absorption in V band is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). Because E(B-V) is the color excess, and A_V is the extinction in V band.

So for each star, I'll need to calculate their apparent V magnitude (
