Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to remember what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning up to 17 mag or lower. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 V mag, so up to 16 mag or lower.

So any star that's apparent V magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be seen by HIRES. Therefore, a star that both can detect must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16, because that's the limit for HIRES, which is stricter than ESPRESSO's 17 mag limit.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, if a star is brighter than (apparent V mag ≤) 16, both can see it. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so any star below 17 can be seen by both? No, wait, no: wait, no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V magnitude of 16 is brighter than one with 17. So if a spectrograph can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, that would mean it can observe stars with V ≤17, right? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Wait, no, the way it's written: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, when they say brighter than, does that mean magnitude less than 17 (since lower magnitudes are brighter), or greater than 17? Oh. Magnitude scale is a bit tricky. So a star with V magnitude of 1 is brighter than a star with V=6. So when they say "brighter than 17 mag", it's stars with V <17. Because 17 is fainter than 16. So if a star's V is 16.5, it's brighter than 17.

Wait, let me double-check. So the ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17. HIRES can observe stars with V ≤16.

So a star must have V ≤16 to be detected by both, because HIRES can't see stars above 16. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤16 for both to see it.

Now, let's go through each star and calculate their apparent V magnitudes.

Star1: absolute V mag = 15.5, distance is 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) at 10 pc. So since Star1 is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is the same as its absolute
