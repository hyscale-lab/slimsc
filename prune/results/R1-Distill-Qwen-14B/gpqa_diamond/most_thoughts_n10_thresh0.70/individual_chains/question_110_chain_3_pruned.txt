Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking which stars can be observed by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key here is understanding the magnitude limits for each instrument. From the problem, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude, while HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V. So, a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, actually, I think I might have that backward. Oh wait, the problem says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Brighter means lower magnitude, right? Because in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, the star must have V mag <17. Similarly for HIRES: V mag <16.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. The way magnitudes work is that lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star has an apparent V magnitude of 17, it's dimmer than a star with 16. So the limit for ESPRESSO is V <17, meaning it can observe up to 17th magnitude. So any star with V magnitude less than that is observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe up to V <16, so stars brighter than 16 mag. Wait, the problem is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read it again.

The problem says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So, the apparent V magnitude has to be less than 17. Because if a star is brighter, it's lower in magnitude. So, for ESPRESSO, the limit is V <17. For HIRES, it's V <16. So the star has to be observable by both, so V must be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because a star that's V=16 would be observable by HI
