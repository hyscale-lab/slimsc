Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these things. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what compound X was from the options.

Hmm, wait a second. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. Oh right, it's often used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes through the Prilezhaev epoxidation, but wait, no, Prilezhaev uses a different catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in elimination reactions. Oh, wait! It's also used in the epoxidation of alkenes using peracids, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement? Or perhaps it's a base that deprotonates something, leading to ring formation. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a solvent system for an elimination reaction.

Wait, the reaction conditions are 403 K for a day. That's pretty high temperature. Could it be an acid-catalyzed process? Or perhaps an elimination reaction because of the strong base?

But wait, let's think about the product's NMR. The product is the result of reacting compound X with that base. So maybe the product is an epoxide, because compound X might have been an alkene that was epoxidized. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination product, like a diene becoming an epoxide.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR shows some downfield signals. Let me look at the 1H NMR data. The signals are at Î´ 2.28 (s, 3H), 2.31 (s, 3H), then some aromatic signals: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H
