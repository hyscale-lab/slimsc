Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, right? They're [3,3] sigmatropic shifts, I think.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each producing a product. I need to figure out which option (A-D) correctly identifies A, B, and C.

Let's look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CHNH2, I think. Oh wait, no, wait. It's 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine. So structure is OMe-O-C-C-NH2, but the ethanamine part, maybe it's HOCH2CH2NH2 but with two methoxy groups on the first carbon? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(NH2)(OMe)2. So it's a molecule with a NH2 group attached to a carbon that has two methoxy groups.

But-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. Structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? Wait, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Let me think. But-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would actually have the double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, but but has four carbons. Let me write it as CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no. For but-3-en-2-ol, the structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, but but is four carbons, so 3-en would be between C3 and C4, but that's not possible for four carbons. Oh wait, but numbering might be different. Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. But wait, butane is four carbons, so 1, 2, 3, 4. So 3-en is between carbons 3 and 4? But that would require a five-carbon chain, which can't be. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think
