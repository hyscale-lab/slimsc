Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is equal to 1/2 times (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). They're asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space, and the options are various points in a 3D space, it seems.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But here, ρ is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with coefficient 1/2. So wait, that looks like a classical mixture, right? So it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Wait, in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state would be at the center. The Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, and the center is (0,0,0). So for a single qubit, the density matrix of a completely mixed state is (I + something)/2, but wait, maybe it's (I)/2?

Wait, let me think again. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as: 

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r gives the coordinates on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, r has length 1 because r = 2⟨ψ|σ·|ψ⟩, so for example, |0⟩ would correspond to r = (0,0,1) since that's how the Bloch sphere is set up.

In the given problem, ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute this. Let me write out the matrices for |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. 

|0⟩ is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩ is [0;1], so |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (1/2) * I. So ρ is equal to I/2.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is indeed I. So I multiplied by 1/2, so ρ = I/2. So this is the maximally mixed state. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, the maximally mixed state has r=0, because the density matrix is (I + 0·σ)/2. So ρ = I/2 corresponds to r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the geometrical position is at the origin. 

But wait, another thought: The question says "geometrical position in the qubits space." Does that refer to the Bloch sphere or
