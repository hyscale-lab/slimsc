Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) and NaCN, with the help of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that structure look like? Oh right, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So NaCN would provide the CN- nucleophile.

In ketone additions, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in which conditions does this happen? Oh right, typically, for the addition of HCN or its equivalent, you might use an acid catalyst. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN-, but it's not acidic. So maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, another thought: Sometimes, when you want substitution reactions, you need to protonate the carbonyl first, making it more electrophilic. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. In the presence of a strong acid, like H3O+ or something else, the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making the carbonyl carbon even more positively charged, so the CN- can attack.

So the first step is the addition of CN- to the ketone. The product after that would be a cyanohydrin, I think. A cyanohydrin is when a nucleophile like CN- adds to a carbonyl group, and the oxygen becomes an alcohol. So, the product structure would have an alcohol group (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) both attached to the same carbon. That matches the product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So for the first reaction, we probably need an acid catalyst. Reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Looking at the options, option A has A as H3O+, option C also has A as NaHSO3. Wait, but what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. I'm a bit rusty on that. I think bisulfite is used in the hydroboration reaction or maybe in the addition to carbonyl groups as a source of H
