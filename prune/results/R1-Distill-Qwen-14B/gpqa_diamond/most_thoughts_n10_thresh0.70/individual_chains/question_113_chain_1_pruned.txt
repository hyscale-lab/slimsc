Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are different chemical formulas, all involving carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let's start by looking at the given data:

1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - Very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups. So maybe an alcohol (-OH), carboxylic acid, or maybe an ether? But wait, ethers don't have O-H. So probably either alcohol or carboxylic acid. The broad peak could be due to an -OH group.
   - Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1700 region is typical for either a ketone or an aldehyde, maybe a carboxylic acid or ester as well. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a broader O-H peak around 2500-3300, but I'm not sure. Also, the peak around 1650 could be another carbonyl group or maybe something else. Wait, 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like C=C in a ring), or maybe an amide, but that's less likely here.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum:**
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes or aromatic rings. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere, maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring. But wait, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So either an alkene or aromatic ring.

3. **Mass Spectrometry:**
   - Fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: the molecular ion could break into smaller fragments. For example, CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) has a fragment at 45, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a ketone group? Or maybe the loss of something like (CH3)2CO leads to a fragment
