Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I've heard a bit about this before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The multiple-choice options pair these.

Wait, wait. First, I need to remember what each symmetry entails and what SMEFT is about. SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So any operator beyond the renormalizable Standard Model must still obey those symmetries.

Let's go through each symmetry one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So any operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. Because if you add an operator that isn't Lorentz-invariant, that would break the symmetry, which isn't allowed. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a broader symmetry. Since SMEFT is built upon the Standard Model, which respects Poincare symmetry, I think all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. Wait, but wait, isn't the Poincare symmetry more about the overall structure, like being a symmetry in the presence of external fields or something? Or does it automatically come into play because SMEFT is a field theory built in a way that respects it. I think that, yes, SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry as part of the foundation. So operator terms must be Poincare invariant. So option 2 is correct.

3. CP Symmetry: The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric. For instance, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, right? Because if the SM already has CP violation, SMEFT can include terms that have it too. So not all operators need to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must. So 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT Symmetry: The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric. Because the SM includes CPT symmetry, which combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT. Because if you have an operator that doesn't, that would break CPT, which isn't allowed because the SM already has it. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. Are all the operators in SMEFT required to respect CPT? Because I remember that in effective theories, especially when you have higher-dimension operators, sometimes you can have operators that break certain symmetries if the underlying theory respects them. But wait, SMEFT is supposed to be a valid low-energy theory, so it must respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model. Or is CPT automatically preserved because the SM does?

Yes, because the Standard Model is CPT symmetric. So any operator added to SMEFT, being part of the SM's effective theory, must respect CPT. So 4 is correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations. So all operators must respect both, but the question lists them as separate options. So in the question, the options are 1,2,3,4. So the correct ones are 1,2,4.

But wait, looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1,2
B)3,4
C)1,2,4
D)1,3,4

So if 1,2,4 are correct, then the answer would be option C. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, some sources say that the SM is Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetric, but not necessarily CP. So SMEFT must include operators that respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP. So yes, all operators must respect 1,2,4. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait. I thought Poincare symmetry is a bit more general. Since the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators, perhaps the question is considering whether each symmetry is an explicit symmetry of the theory, such as whether Poincare is automatically handled because the operators are built in a way that respects it.

But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are formed from the SM fields and their covariant derivatives, so they automatically respect the symmetries of the SM, including Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare. So Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT are the required symmetries.

So the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking back, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to include all possible higher-dimensional operators that respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT is built as an effective theory of the SM. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. This makes option 1 correct.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory built on the foundation of the SM, which respects Poincaré symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, option 2 is correct.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric due to CP violation in processes like the CKM matrix. SMEFT can include operators that violate CP, as CP violation is already present in the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators in SMEFT, making option 3 incorrect.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, must respect CPT symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT that violates CPT would contradict the fundamental symmetry of the SM. Hence, option 4 is correct.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is the option that includes these three symmetries.

**Answer: C**
