Okay, let's try to figure out this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the setup is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) from the Sun's core to reach Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would take about 8.5 minutes to be observed here. But in this scenario, we're not considering the time delay affecting the flux measurement. Instead, we're looking at the fluxes of neutrinos in two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops.

The question is about the ratio of fluxes between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux1/flux2 = ?

I remember that the pp chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, and the pp-III branch is a part of that. The pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton and a helium-3 nucleus to produce helium-4, a positron, and two neutrinos. But wait, neutrinos are produced in each step of the process, right?

Wait, actually, the dominant neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos (ν_e) produced in the proton-proton chain, particularly in the steps where a boron-8 nucleus decays into two helium-4 nuclei and emits neutrinos. Oh wait, I think the main neutrino emission comes from the decay of boron-8, which occurs in the later stages of the pp chain. So, the pp-III branch stopping would affect the production of these neutrinos.

If the pp-III branch stops, that means the protons (H) are not fusing with helium-3 (He3) anymore. So the production of boron-8 (B8) would stop. Because B8 is produced via the pp-III branch. Or is it part of the earlier branches? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the steps of the proton-proton chain.

The proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The pp-I branch converts two protons into deuterium, then into helium-3. The pp-II branch combines two helium-3 nuclei into boron-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei, positrons, and neutrinos. The pp-III branch is when a helium-3 fuses with a helium-4 to produce helium-7, but that's not the main pathway. Oh wait, no, maybe the pp-III branch is the fusion of a proton and a helium-3 nucleus to produce a helium-4, a positron, and two neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, that means this particular reaction isn't happening anymore.

Wait, but the main neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, right? Because B8 has a half-life of about 19 minutes, I think. So if the pp-III branch stops, that would stop the production of B8. But wait, the B8 is produced in the pp-II branch as well. Let me think: in the pp-II branch, two He3s combine to form B8, which then decays into two He4s plus other products and neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, does that affect the production of B8? Or is it a different part of the chain? Let me get this straight. The pp-I and pp-II are the main branches leading to He. So the pp-III is a branch that may not be as significant, perhaps in a different part of the Sun's core.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the branches. Maybe the pp-III branch is the one where a proton and He3 combine to form He4, emitting a positron and two neutrinos. So if that reaction stops, then the production of He4 would be affected, but the main B8 production (from two He3s) would continue. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor pathway, and the main neutrino production comes from the decay of B8, which is produced in the pp-II branch. So if pp-III stops, would that affect the neutrino flux significantly? Or maybe the neutrinos come from different reactions.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stops, but all other reactions remain as they were. So other processes, like the pp-I and pp-II branches, are unaffected.

I think the neutrinos (ν_e) mainly come from the decay of B8. The reaction is B8 → 2 He4 + 2 e+ + 2 ν_e. So if the production of B8 is stopped, then the neutrino flux would drop because those are the main sources.

But wait, if the pp-III branch is stopped, but the pp-II branch continues, then B8 is still being produced. So neutrino production from B8 would continue. Hmm, so maybe the stopping of
