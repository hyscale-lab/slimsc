Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem starts with benzene being treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. Hmm, I remember that nitration is a common electrophilic substitution reaction. Benzene reacts with a nitrating mixture (HNO3 and H2SO4) to form nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene, right?

Next step: product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Oh wait, Br2 with Fe is a brominating agent, but under what conditions? Iron in HBr is usually for substitution reactions, but wait, nitro groups are strong meta directors. So nitrobenzene brominating would add Br at the meta position relative to the nitro group. So nitrobenzene has the nitro group at position 1, so bromine would add at position 3, making 3-bromonitrobenzene. So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene, or maybe the nitro group is in a specific position.

Wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me think: benzene is a ring, so when you nitrate it, the nitro group goes into the meta position when further substitution occurs. So in product 2, which is bromination. Oh wait, wait, wait. Benzene after nitration becomes nitrobenzene. Then, when we brominate nitrobenzene, the nitro group is a meta director, so the Br adds in the meta position. So the nitro is in position 1, Br in position 3.

So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene. So now, the structure is a benzene ring with a nitro group (NO2) at position 1 and a Br at position 3.

Then, product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. Pd/C and H2 are for hydrogenation. The nitro group (NO2) can be reduced to an amine. So the nitro group becomes NH2. So product 3 would be 3-bromoaniline. Structure: benzene ring with NH2 in position 1 and Br in position 3.

Next step: product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4. I think that's the diazotization reaction. Diazonium salt formation. So in acidic conditions, the amine (NH2) is converted to a diazonium chloride. So product 4 would be the benzene ring with a diazonium group (-N2+ Cl^-) at position 1 and Br at 3.

Wait, but wait, what about the substituents? The structure is 3-bromo-phenyl diazonium chloride. So structure is: position 1 is N2+ Cl^-, position 3 is Br.

Then, product 4 is heated and treated with anisole. Heating the diazonium salt with an aromatic compound. Oh, this is a coupling reaction, like a Sandmeyer reaction or maybe a Friedlander synthesis? Alternatively, perhaps it's a Ullmann coupling or some kind of coupling where the aromatic ring couples with another ring.

Wait, anisole is methoxybenzene. So when you have a diazonium salt and heat it with an aromatic ring that has activating groups, perhaps a coupling occurs. The diazonium group can undergo a coupling reaction, or perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, another thought: when a diazonium salt is heated with a phenol or anisole (which has an activating group like OMe), it can undergo a coupling reaction. The diazonium group acts as an electrophile, and the anisole would have a position where it can attack. But wait, the diazonium group is usually involved in substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when a diazonium salt is treated with an activated aromatic ring, such as anisole, which is strongly activated, perhaps a coupling occurs. For example, in the presence of a copper catalyst, the diazonium salt can couple with the aromatic ring, forming a biphenyl structure.

Wait, product 4 is a nitro compound that was reduced, then diazotized. So product 4 is the diazonium salt of 3-bromoaniline. So when heated with anisole, perhaps the diazonium group couples with the anisole ring.

Anisole has a methoxy group which is a strong activating group (ortho/para director). So the coupling would occur at the para position relative to the OMe group. Wait, but the diazonium group is the electrophilic part. So the anisole would attack the diazonium group, or vice versa?

Wait, in the coupling reaction, the aromatic ring with the diazonium group (the benzene ring with N2+ and Br) would couple with anisole. The position where coupling occurs would depend on the directing groups on each ring.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: the diazonium salt is Ar-N2+ Cl^- where Ar is the benzene ring with Br at position 3. So when this reacts with anisole (which is OMe-benzene), the coupling occurs between the two rings.

In such coupling reactions, typically, the diazonium ring's substituents (like Br) and the activating group on the other ring (OMe) will direct where the new bond forms.

Wait, but in this case, the diazonium ring has Br in position 3. The anisole has OMe in position 1 (assuming the numbering for anisole is such that OMe is in position 1). So when coupling, the positions that are meta to the Br on the diazonium ring would be position 1, but wait, that might not be correct. Or perhaps the coupling occurs at the para position of the OMe in anisole.

Alternatively, maybe the coupling occurs in such a way that the diazonium group attaches to the anisole ring at the para position relative to the OMe group. Because the OMe is a strong activating group, and the para position is typically where coupling occurs.

Wait, but I'm not very clear on this. So let me think about the possible products.

If the coupling occurs between the benzene ring from the diazonium salt (which has Br at position 3) and the anisole ring (OMe in position 1), then the new bond forms between the two rings. The position on the anisole ring would be the para position relative to OMe, which is position 4. So the anisole would have the biphenyl group attached at position 4.

Wait, but wait: when you have a coupling reaction between a diazonium salt and an aryl halide, you typically get a biphenyl structure. But in this case, the coupling is between two aromatic rings, one from the diazonium salt (which has substituents) and the other being anisole.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is a substitution reaction where the diazonium group replaces a hydrogen on the anisole ring. But the OMe group is a strong activating group, so the substitution would occur at the para or ortho position relative to OMe.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Anisole is OMe attached to benzene. The diazonium group (Ar–N2+ Cl^-) is attached to another benzene ring which has Br at position 3.

When they couple, the diazonium group would attach to the anisole ring. Let's say the anisole has OMe in position 1. Then, the new substituent (from the diazonium ring) would attach either at position 2 (ortho), 3 (meta) or 4 (para) relative to OMe.

But in coupling reactions, the substituents on the diazonium ring can direct the attack. The Br is on the diazonium ring, which is a meta director. So the attack on the diazonium ring would be at the meta position with respect to Br. But wait, the diazonium group is a leaving group in this coupling.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, the coupling could be between the two rings, so the diazonium group (Ar–N2+) would form a bond with the anisole ring. Let's think about the positions.

The diazonium ring has Br at position 3 and the diazonium group at position 1. When this couples with anisole's ring, the point of attachment would be on the anisole ring. Since anisole's OMe is a strong activating group, the incoming group (from the diazonium) would attach at the para position relative to OMe.

So the anisole (methoxybenzene) would have the biphenyl group attached at position 4 (para to OMe). So the new structure would be a biphenyl where one ring has Br at position 3 and the other has OMe at position 1, and the biphenyl connects them.

So the final product would be 1,1'-biphenyl with substituents. Let me try to number.

Wait, the biphenyl has two benzene rings connected at position 1. So the first ring (left) has a Br at position 3. The second ring (right) has OMe at position 4 (since it's para to where the biphenyl connects). So the substituents would be on the left ring (Br at position 3) and the right ring (OMe at position 4).

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C) 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.

Yes, that's exactly what I just thought. Because the left ring (the one from the diazonium salt) has Br at position 3, and the right ring (from anisole) has OMe at position 4 (since it's para to the point where the biphenyl connects, which is position 1 on the anisole ring).

So the structure is 3-bromo on the left ring and 4'-methoxy on the right ring of the biphenyl.

Looking at the options, option C says 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. That matches.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene (product 1)
2. Nitrobenzene → bromination with FeBr3 (Wait wait, no, product 1 is treated with Br2 and Fe powder. Oh, in the problem statement, it's Br2 and Fe, not FeBr3. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, when you brominate benzene, you typically use FeBr3 as a catalyst. But the problem says Fe powder. Wait, did I make a mistake there?

Wait, so product 1 is nitrobenzene. Then, product 1 is treated with Br2 and Fe. Fe in HBr is a substitute for FeBr3, I think. So the bromination occurs under substitution conditions, directed by the nitro group. So yes, the nitro group is a meta director, so Br adds at position 3.

So product 2 is 3-bromo-nitrobenzene.

Then, product 2 is hydrogenated with Pd/C and H2. Nitro group (NO2) becomes NH2. So product 3 is 3-bromoaniline.

Then, product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4. That's the formation of the diazonium chloride. So product 4 is 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride.

Heating product 4, which is the diazonium salt, with anisole. So this is a coupling reaction. The diazonium group (Ar–N2+Cl^-) would couple with anisole. Anisole has OMe, which is a strong activating group, so it directs incoming substituents to the para position.

So anisole has OMe in position 1. The coupling occurs at position 4 (para to OMe). So the biphenyl forms where the left ring has Br at position 3, and the right ring has OMe at position 4.

Thus, the final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and progressing through multiple transformations to yield the final product. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Nitration**: Benzene reacts with HNO₃ and H₂SO₄ to form nitrobenzene (product 1). Nitro groups are strong meta-directors.

2. **Bromination**: Nitrobenzene is treated with Br₂ and Fe powder. The nitro group directs bromination to the meta position, forming 3-bromo-nitrobenzene (product 2).

3. **Reduction**: 3-Bromo-nitrobenzene is treated with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. The nitro group (NO₂) is reduced to an amine (NH₂), forming 3-bromoaniline (product 3).

4. **Diazotization**: 3-Bromoaniline is treated with NaNO₂ and HBF₄. The amine group is converted into a diazonium salt, forming 3-bromo-benzenediazonium chloride (product 4).

5. **Coupling Reaction**: The diazonium salt is heated with anisole (methoxybenzene). The diazonium group couples with the anisole ring. The methoxy group (OMe) on anisole is a strong activating group and directs the coupling to the para position relative to itself. The final product is a biphenyl structure where the left ring has a bromine atom at position 3, and the right ring has a methoxy group at position 4.

The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
