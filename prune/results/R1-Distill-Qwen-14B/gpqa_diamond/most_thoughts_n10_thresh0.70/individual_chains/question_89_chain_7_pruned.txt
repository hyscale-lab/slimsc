Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. 1,3-dibromo would mean there are bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are heated with bases, I think it's an elimination reaction. So maybe dehydrohalogenation? But wait, adamantane is a very rigid structure. So heating with KOH would probably lead to an elimination to form an alkene. But wait, dibromides can undergo either substitution or elimination. Since KOH is a base and it's heated, elimination is more likely.

So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond. But where? Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, elimination between the two bridgehead positions might form a conjugated diene? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead carbon is connected to three other carbons. So if we remove H from each adjacent carbon (1 and 3), eliminating two HBr molecules, maybe forming two double bonds? Or perhaps a single double bond?

Wait, another thought
