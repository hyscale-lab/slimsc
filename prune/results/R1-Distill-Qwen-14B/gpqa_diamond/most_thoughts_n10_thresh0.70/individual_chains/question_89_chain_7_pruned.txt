Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through it step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. So, 1,3-dibromo must have two bromines opposite each other on the adamantane structure.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromines on adjacent carbons (or maybe across the structure?), heating would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but in 1,3-dibromo, the bromines are on the same face or opposite faces? Hmm, maybe not. Oh wait, in dehydrohalogenation, each Br would be removed, and in their place, a double bond would form. So if we have two adjacent Br atoms, removing each would form a double bond. But wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the positions are 1 and 3 on the adamantane, which is a four-fused cyclohexane structure. So the two Brs are across from each other, not adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's more like a di-elimination, leading to a diene?

Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, might form a diepoxy or maybe a diol? Wait, no
