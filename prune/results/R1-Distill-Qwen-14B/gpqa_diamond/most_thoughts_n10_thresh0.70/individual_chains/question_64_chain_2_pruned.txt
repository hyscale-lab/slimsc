Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through three tubes in succession. The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1's weight increased by 3.60g.
- Tube 3's weight increased by 0.80g (CuO formed here).
- Tube 2's weight didn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, heating salts A and B to 200°C without air suggests that a decomposition reaction is happening. Decomposition typically produces gases, which aligns with the problem statement.

The gases pass through three tubes:

1. Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. It probably absorbs water, as Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent. So if the gas entering tube 1 has water vapor, it would be absorbed, increasing the tube's weight by 3.60g. So, the water vapor is H2O, right? The mass gained here is 3.60g of H2O.

Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is used for drying, but sometimes it's used in columns to trap water. So yes, the 3.60g increase is water vapor.

2. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If any CO2 gas is present, it would react with the solution and cause CaCO3 precipitation, but the problem states that the weight of tube 2 didn't change. That suggests that there was no CO2 in the gas mixture. Because if CO2 was present, it would have reacted, increasing the mass of tube 2. So no CO2 was present in the gases after tube 1. Hmm, but wait, maybe the gas that does react is something else? Or perhaps the absence of reaction implies that the gas didn't have any acidic components that would react with Ca(OH)2.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else, like NH3 or H2S, but those are possibilities I might need to consider.

3. Tube 3: red-hot copper. So, the gas passing through here is probably reacting with the copper. Red-hot copper is often used to react with oxygen or maybe sulfur gases.

Wait, if the gas is a sulfur-containing gas like SO2 or H2S, when it reacts with hot copper, it could form CuS or other compounds. But the product is CuO, which suggests that oxygen is being released or that an oxide is formed. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a reducing agent that reacts with CuO. Oh, wait, if the gas is H2S, it would react with CuO, but in that case, the Cu would be in the solid state. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO or something else.

But wait, the problem says that tube 3's weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So, the reaction likely involves the gas reacting with Cu to form CuO. Let's think about possible reactions.

H2S is a gas that can react with Cu. For example, H2S can pass through CuO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is SO2, but how would that react
