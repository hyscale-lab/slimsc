Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, the question is about figuring out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference over 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames are non-accelerating, so that makes things simpler because we don't have to worry about changing velocities or anything like that.

From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in their reference frame, the galaxy is approaching at that speed. But we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, that sounds like a problem involving time dilation or the relativity of simultaneity, but maybe it's just a matter of relative velocity. Oh wait, if the frames are inertial, perhaps we can use the concept of relative velocity without worrying about acceleration.

Wait, but the thing is, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is at rest in their own frame, and the galaxy is moving towards them. So in the galaxy's frame, which is the one we're interested in, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s, right? Because velocities reverse when you switch frames, assuming they are moving at a constant speed relative to each other.

Wait, but wait, that's the thing. If frame E (ejecta) sees the galaxy moving at v, then the galaxy's frame G sees the ejecta moving at -v. So in G's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s.

But the question is, how much distance does the ejecta cover in G's frame when 50 seconds pass in E's frame. Oh, wait, but time in different frames... So if 50 seconds pass in E's frame, how much time has passed in G's frame? Because moving clocks run slower, right?

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because if the frames are moving relative to each other, time dilation comes into play. So the time experienced in each frame would be different
