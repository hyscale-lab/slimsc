Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Then, at shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops significantly. I remember that quasars, being very bright and distant objects, often have their light redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. So, the peak emission might be in the ultraviolet or optical, but we're seeing it redshifted into the near infrared.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm is in the near infrared. That's longer than optical wavelengths. So the original emission must have been from a shorter wavelength. I think the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm, which is in the far UV. But if the quasar's light is redshifted so that this line is now observed at 790 nm, that would tell us a lot about the redshift.

But wait, the question isn't directly about redshift; it's about the comoving distance. Oh right, comoving distance is a way to measure distance in cosmology, considering the expansion of the universe. The comoving distance for a given object is the distance you would measure if you could somehow place a ruler between two points, taking into account the expansion.

The question gives the parameters of the universe as per the Lambda-CDM model: Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ω_m is 0.3, dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ is 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k is 0). These parameters are standard in cosmology calculations.

The quasar's peak is at 790 nm. I think this is the rest frame of the quasar, but wait—no, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted, so that would be due to redshift. Let me think. The rest wavelength for certain emission lines... Like maybe the Lyman-alpha line is 121.6 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, the redshift z can be calculated.

Redshift z is given by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So z = (790 / 121.6) - 1 ≈ (6.5) -1 = 5.5. Wait, that's a high redshift. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from another emission line. Oh wait, sometimes the emission lines of quasars are broad and prominent. Another common line is the Balmer series, like H-alpha at 656 nm in the rest frame. If that's the case, then if observed at 790 nm, z = (790 / 656) -1 ≈ 1.204 -1 = 0.204. But wait, 790 is longer than 656, so that would be a redshift of about 0.204.

But wait, the question says that the flux drops at shorter wavelengths than
