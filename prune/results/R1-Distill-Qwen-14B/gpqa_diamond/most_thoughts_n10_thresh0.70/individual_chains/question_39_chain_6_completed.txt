Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see if I can figure it out. I remember that wave functions have to satisfy certain conditions, like normalization. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So in this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, the wave function is a complex number because of the 'i' term. I think the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the probability of finding the particle between x=1 and x=3 is 1, because in the problem statement, they didn't find any particles outside that region. So the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

Let me write down the wave function: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The absolute square is ψ*(x)ψ(x). So ψ*(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i, right? Because you change the sign of the imaginary part.

Multiplying them together: [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5i)(-0.5i) * (2 terms from cross multiplication). Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Actually, when you have ψ = A + Bi, then ψ* = A - Bi. So ψ*ψ = A² + B². Oh yeah, because (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² - (Bi)^2 = A² + B².

So in this case, A is (a / sqrt(1 + x)), and B is -0.5. So the absolute square is (a²)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2. So that's (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

But wait, wait. No, because B is -0.5, so B squared is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So yes, ψ*ψ is (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, no. Let me redo that. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ*(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i.

Multiplying ψ* and ψ:

ψ*ψ = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(0.5i).

Hmm, but wait, the cross terms. Let me compute it step by step.

First term: [a/sqrt(1+x)] * [a/sqrt(1+x)] = (a²)/(1+x)

Second term: [a/sqrt(1+x)] * [0.5i] = 0.5 a i / sqrt(1+x)

Third term: [0.5i] * [a/sqrt(1+x)] = same as second term, but multiplied by i and a.

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply ψ* and ψ, it's (A + B)(A - B) if they're complex conjugates. But in this case, ψ* is (A + C), where C is 0.5i, and ψ is (A + D), where D is -0.5i. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. No, I think the correct way is to compute the product.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more carefully.

ψ(x) = A + B, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5i. Then ψ*(x) = A* - B* = A + 0.5i.

So ψ*ψ = (A + 0.5i)(A - 0.5i) = A² - (0.5i)^2.

Wait, wait, that's not correct. Because (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B², where B is 0.5i.

So, ψ*ψ = (A)^2 - (0.5i)^2. But (0.5i)^2 is (0.25 i²) = -0.25. So ψ*ψ= A² - (-0.25) = A² + 0.25.

So, yes, ψ*ψ = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Okay, so the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right because (a²)/(1+x) could be less than the total probability. Wait, but the integral from x=1 to x=3 of the probability density should equal 1. So the integral of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the integral would be:

Integral [ (a²)/(1+x) dx ] + Integral [0.25 dx ] from 1 to3.

Compute each part:

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluated from 1 to3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. So a² ≈ 0.7213, which means a is about sqrt(0.7213)≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That must be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when calculating the absolute square, it's (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because (Imaginary part is -0.5, so when squared it's positive 0.25). So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So the integral from 1 to3.

So the integral becomes:

Integral from 1 to3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx.

Which is a² ∫1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫dx.

Which is a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1).

That's a² [ln(4)-ln(2)] + 0.5. ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so this becomes a² (ln(2)) +0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2). ln(2) is about 0.6931, so 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. So the answer should be option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function must be normalized, meaning the total probability of finding the particle in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) is 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is the absolute square of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). For a complex wave function \( \psi(x) = A + Bi \), where \( A \) is the real part and \( B \) is the imaginary part, the probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = A^2 + B^2
\]

Here, \( A = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) and \( B = -0.5 \). Thus, the probability density becomes:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density over the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) equals 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx
   \]  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]  
   Thus, the first integral becomes:  
   \[
   a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining both results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):  
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):  
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:  
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

This value is closest to the given option \( 0.85 \). Therefore, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \).

**Answer: B**
