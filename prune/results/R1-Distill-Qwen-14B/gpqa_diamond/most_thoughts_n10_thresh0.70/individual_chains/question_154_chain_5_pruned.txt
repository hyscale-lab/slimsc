Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with spectral analysis, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question involves identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out which structure matches the given data.

Let's start by looking at the mass spectral information. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, so the molecular ion is 156. If the M+ is 156, that suggests the molecular weight is around there. The peak at 158 is 32% abundance. I remember that when there's a chlorine atom in the molecule, the mass spectrum can show peaks corresponding to the isotopic composition. Chlorine has two main isotopes: Cl-35 (about 75%) and Cl-37 (about 25%). So if the molecular ion is 156 and there's a Cl, then the M+ peak would be at 156 (for 35Cl) and 158 (for 37Cl). Wait, but wait. The molecular ion is at 156, but the presence of Cl would mean that the molecular formula includes Cl. Let me calculate the possible formula.

Assuming the molecular weight is 156, and considering Cl (which is about 35.5), let's see. Let's take option B for example, 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate that: C is 12*7=84, H is 5, Cl is 35.5, O is 16*2=32. Adding up: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. Hmm, so the molecular weight would be about 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Maybe that's close enough, considering the way mass spectrometry works. Or perhaps I should think about the exact mass. Let me check the exact masses.

The exact mass of Cl is about 34.96885. So the exact molecular weight would be:

C7H5ClO2: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 34.96885, 2*16=32. So total is 84 +5 +34.96885 +32 = 155.96885. So the molecular ion would be at approximately 156. But the M+ peak is at 156, which matches, and the M+2 peak (if Cl is present) would be 158. So the ratio of 100% at 156 and 32% at 158 makes sense because Cl has a 3:1 ratio (but wait, chlorine's natural abundance is about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl). So the intensity of the M and M+2 peaks should be in a 3:1 ratio. Wait, but the given data is 100% at 156 and 32% at 158. Hmm, that's roughly a 3:1 ratio because 32 is about a third of 100. So that supports the presence of a Cl atom.

Next, looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like from alcohols, carboxylic acids, or maybe phenols. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So, in carboxylic acids, the carbonyl peak is around 1700 cm^-1, but it can be higher if there's electron-withdrawing groups nearby. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or acid chloride. Wait, acid chlorides typically have higher carbonyl peaks, around 1800-1850 cm^-1. So 1720 might be more like an acid or ester. Hmm, but wait, in the options, options B and D are benzoic acids, while C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester or maybe a carbonate.

The 1H NMR data is next. Let's see: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), that's a strong singlet. High chemical shift (like around 10-12 ppm) suggests an -OH proton, but in what context? If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH is usually around 10-12 as a broad peak. But wait, in the NMR, it's a singlet, which might suggest it's not a typical carboxylic acid, because the -OH in carboxylic acids are usually broad, but sometimes can be a singlet if exchange is slow. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but the given is 11.0, so more downfield. Oh, another possibility is an aldehyde in a conjugated system, like in benzaldehyde derivatives. But wait, let me think.

Wait, let's look at the other NMR signals. There's a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H, d). So this suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and couple with each other, giving a doublet each. So for example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the H NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, like in the case of para-substituted benzaldehydes or benzoic acids.

So putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 11 ppm might be the -OH group of a carboxylic acid, but wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak. Alternatively, the singlet could be an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait, let me think about the options.

Options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So that would be a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH at positions 3 and 2, so ortho to each other. Wait, no, position 3 would be meta to position 2. Oh, I'm a bit confused. Let's imagine the benzene ring. So number the ring: position 1 is where the substituent (like aldehyde) is. Then position 2 is OH, and position 3 is Cl. So in that case, the ring would have substituents at 1 (aldehyde), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). Wait, but the NMR shows a para pattern, which would imply substituents opposite each other. So if the aldehyde is at position 1, then the substituents at 2 and 3 would not be para to each other. Hmm, maybe this is not the case. Alternatively, perhaps option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So in benzoic acid, the structure is benzene ring with a COOH group. So if the Cl is at position 4, then the substituents would be at position 1 (COOH) and position 4 (Cl). That would be para to each other. So in that case, the NMR would show a para pattern. Let's think about the NMR of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but in this case, the peak is a singlet. Wait, but if the -OH is exchange broadened, it might appear as a singlet but broad, but the given peak is a singlet. However, in the case of a carboxylic acid in DMSO or another solvent, the -OH might be a singlet, but normally in NMR, the -OH can appear as a broad peak. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is phenyl chloroformate. Chloroformate is OCOCl. So the structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. In that case, the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the IR. The phenyl group would have aromatic protons. Let me think about the NMR.

In phenyl chloroformate, the aromatic protons would be in the 7.7-8.0 ppm region, as in the NMR. Let's see, the substituent is Cl and OCOCl. Wait, no, wait, phenyl chloroformate is ClCO-O-Ph. So the substituents on the benzene ring would be OCOCl and Cl? No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the benzene ring is attached to the O of the carbonate group. So the substit
