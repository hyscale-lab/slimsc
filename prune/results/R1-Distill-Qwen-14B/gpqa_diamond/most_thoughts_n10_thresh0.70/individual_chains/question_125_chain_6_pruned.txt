Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, I remember that the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is a common problem in quantum mechanics. The potential is like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy. Hmm, I need to figure out both parts.

First, let's remember the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each dimension. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, right. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or sometimes I've seen it written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each dimension contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up, it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Which is the same as (n + 3/2) ħω where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, another way: n can be 0,1,2,... and the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So the ground state is n=0, E = 3/2 ħω. First excited state is n=1, E=5/2 ħω. Second excited is n=2, E=7/2 ħω. Third excited would be n=3, E=9/2 ħω. Oh wait, no: wait, the ground state is n=0, so the first excited (n=1), second (n=2), third (n=3). So the third excited state is n=3.

So the energy would be (3 + 3/2) ħω? Wait no, wait. Wait, n is the sum of the quantum numbers. So each n_i is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So for the third excited state, n=3. Therefore, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The formula is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So when n=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's 4.5 ħω. Looking at the options, option A and C have (9/2) ħω, so that's a good sign.

Now, the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy eigenvalue as the third excited state. That is, for n=3, how many distinct eigenfunctions are there with E = (9/2) ħω.

Hmm, the number of eigenfunctions for a given energy level is determined by the number of ways the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z can add up to the total n. Since n = n_x + n_y + n_z =3, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation.

So we can model this as a combinatorics problem: find the number of ways to distribute 3 quanta among 3 dimensions. This is a stars and bars problem. The formula is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (3 + 3 -1 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 distinct eigenfunctions for n=3.

Wait, let me think again. For n=3, the number of eigenfunctions is the number of ways to write 3 as the sum of three non-negative integers. So possible combinations are:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3): these are the
