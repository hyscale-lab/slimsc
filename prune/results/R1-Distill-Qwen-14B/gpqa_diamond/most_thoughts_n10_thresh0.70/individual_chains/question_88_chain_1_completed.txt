Okay, so I've got this science question here about rotavirus and some experiments done with it. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

The question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They found the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Wait, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're like areas in the small intestine that contain a lot of immune cells, especially B cells. So when the GFP-tagged proteins reach there, it suggests that the immune system is responding to the rotavirus antigens.

In the experiment, the fluorescence was destroyed partly by stomach acid. Stomach acid is pretty harsh, so some antigens might not survive that. But the ones that get through and reach the Peyer patches probably are processed by the immune system.

The cells they isolated are proliferating. High variability in the variable heavy chain genes sounds like something that happens during an immune response. What processes change the variable regions of antibodies?

Let me think about the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This process occurs in B cells during the immune response, especially in the germinal centers. It introduces random mutations in the variable regions of the heavy chains, leading to more diverse antibodies. So this would cause high variability.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the immune response, but it's more about the activation of the complement system, which leads to things like opsonization or lysis of pathogens. I don't think it directly causes variability in the variable heavy chains.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the variability in the antigen-binding region. It's more about function, not diversity.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the process that happens during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the initial diversity of the B cell receptor. But this happens early on, during development, not necessarily during an immune response to a specific antigen.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the process taking place after the cells are isolated and they're seeing high variability in the variable regions. So during an immune response, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of their antibodies. This is particularly important for generating high-affinity antibodies. So when a pathogen is encountered, the B cells in the germinal centers undergo this process, leading to different variants of the same initial B cell receptor.

The question also mentions that the variable heavy chain gene shows high variability. That's exactly what happens with somatic hypermutation. So the process is probably A) somatic hypermutation.

Other points: The GFP-tagged proteins were delivered orally, so they're likely being processed by the GALT. The Peyer patches are where these antigens would be sampled, and the B cells there would activate and then go to the germinal centers to undergo hypermutation.

So the correct answer should be A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence was partially destroyed by stomach acid, and some proteins reached the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The fluorescent Peyer patches were identified, and the proliferating cell population was isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells revealed high variability.

Peyer patches are known to sample antigens and initiate immune responses, particularly involving B cells. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that increases antibody diversity. Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in B cells during immune responses, particularly in germinal centers, where random mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the heavy chains. This increases antibody diversity and leads to high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, making it the most likely process.
- **B) Complement activation**: This involves the complement system targeting pathogens but does not directly cause variability in the variable heavy chains.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of the antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the antigen-binding region.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, creating initial diversity but not the high variability observed during an immune response.

Given the context of the experiment and the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
