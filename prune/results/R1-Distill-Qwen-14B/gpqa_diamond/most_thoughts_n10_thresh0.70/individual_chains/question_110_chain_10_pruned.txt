Alright, let's tackle this multiple-choice question about detecting stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the HIRES spectrograph. Hmm, okay, so the question is asking which stars can be observed by both instruments based on their brightness as observed in the V band.

Wait, I remember that bothESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, part of the European Southern Observatory, while HIRES is at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The question provides the limiting magnitudes for V band observations: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So, any star with V magnitude ≤16 (for HIRES) and ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) would be detectable by both, assuming other factors like distance and extinction don't interfere. But wait, some stars might be affected by interstellar extinction, which makes them appear dimmer.

Let me go through each star one by one. The options are Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. Let's break down each star.

Star1: RA 15 deg, DEC -75 deg, absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. Since it's already at 10 pc, its apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But wait, is there any extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star1, so I guess extinction is zero here. So apparent V is 15.5. Both ESPRESSO (max 17) and HIRES (max 16) can detect this. So Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: RA 30, DEC 55, apparent V 16.5, distance 5 pc. Wait, the apparent magnitude is given, so no need to calculate. But do we need to consider extinction? Star2's apparent mag is 16.5. HIRES can go to 16 mag and below, so 16.5 is dimmer than 16. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.5 is within its limit. But since HIRES can't see it, Star2 can't be observed by both.

Star3: RA 11h, DEC 48,
