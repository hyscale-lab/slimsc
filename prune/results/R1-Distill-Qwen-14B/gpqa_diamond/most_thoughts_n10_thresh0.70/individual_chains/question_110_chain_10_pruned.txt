Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including star studies.

The key here is to understand the magnitude limits of each spectrograph. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, so that means it can detect stars down to about 17th magnitude. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so it can go a bit fainter—up to 16 mag.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. The way it's worded is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Oh, wait, I think I might be getting this backwards. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So a star with a V magnitude of 17 is dimmer than one with 16. So if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can detect stars with V magnitudes up to 17—brighter than that. Similarly, HIRES can go up to 16 mag. So HIRES can detect fainter stars than ESPRESSO, because it can go to 16, while ESPRESSO stops at 17.

Wait, no, that's not right. If the magnitude is higher, the star is dimmer. So for example, a star at 17 mag is dimmer than one at 16. So, the ESPRESSO can see stars with V <=17 (since they are brighter than 17). Wait, no, the statement says, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, so if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's within the observable range. So a star with apparent V magnitude of 17 is at the limit—so it's included or excluded?

Wait, I think in astronomy, when they say "brighter than X," they include X
