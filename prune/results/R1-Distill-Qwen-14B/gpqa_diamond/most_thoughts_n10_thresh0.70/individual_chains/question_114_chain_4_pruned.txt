Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step. 

The question has two parts, two reactions, and we need to choose the right reagents A and B from the options. Let me write down what each reaction is doing.

First reaction: Butan-2-one (which is methyl propanone) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles... Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution or addition. Wait, I think when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically don't undergo SN2 reactions because they're not good leaving groups. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis or some kind of addition.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So the reaction is adding CN- to the carbonyl group. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write its structure. So the formula would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but the position is 2. So the structure would be CH2CH(CN)CH2OH? No, maybe I should draw it.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-nitrile is CH2CNCH2CH3. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the mechanism.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with CN-, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. So the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydr
