Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me start by breaking down each reaction and think through what's happening.

The first reaction is with butan-2-one. I remember that butan-2-one is a ketone, right? Its structure is (CH3)2CO. Then it's reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, what's that product? Let me draw it out. So, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So, the ketone must have undergone some kind of addition reaction.

I think this is a substitution where the carbonyl group is replaced. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Because ketones can react with nucleophiles. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, the reaction might be the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically involves adding CN- to a carbonyl group, but I think it usually uses a source of acid, like HCN under acidic conditions. Or wait, maybe the NaCN is providing the CN- and an acid catalyst is needed.

Cyanohydrin formation generally goes through an acid-catalyzed mechanism. So the carbonyl gets protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, forming a new bond. Then the water leaves, forming the cyanohydrin. So in this reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst (A) to form the cyanohydrin. So what's A? It's probably H3O+ because that's a common acid catalyst, like HCl or H2SO4 providing H+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Hmm, what's happening here? The nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the starting material has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So, maybe the nitrile is being hydrolyzed under certain conditions.

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis typically goes to a carboxylic acid under strong acidic or basic conditions. But the product here is a carboxylic acid, so it's a hydrolysis reaction. But the starting material has an existing hydroxyl group. So perhaps the conditions are acidic, which would help in the hydrolysis.

Wait, but in the presence of a hydroxyl group, maybe the nitrile is being oxidized. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis where the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. Let me think about the typical reagents for nitrile hydrolysis.

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using strong acids, like H2SO4 and H2O, under heat. Alternatively, using HCl and water, perhaps with some other conditions. Wait, but if the starting material is a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl group attached, then hydrolysis of the nitrile might proceed more easily.

Wait, the reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile plus B (H2O) to produce the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile is converting to a carboxylic acid. The reagents are B and H2O. So what is B?

In acidic conditions, H2O can act as a nucleophile. So, maybe B is HCl. Because HCl provides H+ which would protonate the nitrile, making it a better electrophile. Then, water attacks, leading to hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but other options: HCl is a strong acid. Another possibility is using H2SO4 as the acid, but looking at the options, the choices
