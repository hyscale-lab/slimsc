Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, so first, I remember that in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the maximum potential energy is when x is A. So the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, in the relativistic case, things are different because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

In classical mechanics, the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. At maximum displacement (x = A), all energy is potential, and at equilibrium (x=0), all is kinetic. But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E is (γ - 1)mc² when the mass is moving at maximum speed v_max. But wait, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². In the relativistic case, does the potential energy change? I think
