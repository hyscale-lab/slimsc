Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, no: the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is going through the glass, which is also moving towards the observer. Or wait, the light is propagating through the glass which is itself moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam? Or is the light beam moving in the same direction as the glass's motion towards the observer?

Wait, the wording says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. But the beam is coming towards the observer, because the glass is moving toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer as well.

Wait, that might complicate things. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, so the beam is in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Hmm.

I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Like, if you have a car moving at velocity u relative to the ground, and another object moving at velocity v relative to the car, the object's velocity relative to the ground isn't just u + v. You have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

But wait, in this case, the speed of light is involved. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n reduces the speed. But that's in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass itself is moving relative to the lab frame.

So I think I need to consider how the speed of light in the glass appears to an observer in the lab frame. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be different because the glass is moving.

Wait, but in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v1 = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So perhaps I should apply a Lorentz transformation here.

Wait, but I'm a
