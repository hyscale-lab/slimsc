Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reagents used are red phosphorus and excess HI. I need to find the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product, and the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a measure that tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or each double bond contributes one to the index. So, the formula to calculate it is Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But wait, in this case, after the reaction, the product's structure will change, so I need to figure out the structure first.

Let me break down the starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The parent ring here is cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. Let me draw the structure mentally. So, cyclohexene would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since cyclohex-3-ene). Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group), and at position 5, a vinyl group (which is a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no. Vinyl is CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- right, like the substituent is a vinyl group, so it's attached as CH2CH2 with a double bond. So, the substituents are on carbons 2 and 5 of the cyclohexene ring.

So, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), a formyl group (which itself has a double bond, but that's part of the substituent, not the ring), and a vinyl group (another double bond).

Wait, but the cyclohexene has one double bond, the formyl group adds another double bond (since it's a CHO group, which has a carbonyl), and the vinyl group is another double bond. So, what's the total number of double bonds in the starting material?

Wait, let me count. The cyclohexene ring has one double bond. Then, the formyl group is –CHO, which has a double bond between C and O. The vinyl group is –CH2–CH2? No, wait, vinyl is –CH2–CH2? No, no, wait, vinyl is a substituent where the group is –CH2–CH2– but that doesn't have a double bond. Or wait, no, vinyl is –CH2–CH2–? No, that's ethyl. Wait, vinyl is –CH2–CH2– with a double bond. Oh, wait no, vinyl is –CH2–CH2– but the double bond is between the two carbons. Oh wait, no, wait, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2–, but that's a single bond. No, no, wait, no. Vinyl group is the group derived from vinyl chloride, which is CH2=CHCl. So, the vinyl substituent would be CH2=CH– attached to the ring. Oh, right! So the vinyl group itself has a double bond.

So, starting with the cyclohexene ring (1 double bond), the formyl group (1 double bond in CHO), and the vinyl group (1 double bond). So that's three double bonds. Plus any rings. But the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring, which is a ring structure, so that adds one more. So, the initial structure has 1 ring (cyclohexene) and 3 double bonds (from ring, formyl, vinyl). So, the index of hydrogen deficiency in the starting material would be 4, right? Because each ring or double bond adds one. But wait, the starting material isn't the product, so I don't need to calculate that. I need to find the product's index.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, that's with HI. Oh, wait, no. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the dehydration of alcohols, but more importantly, I remember that when you have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and you treat it with something like HI and red phosphorus, it might lead to a Wittig reaction or maybe some addition. Wait, no, the Wittig reaction is with triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Alternatively, maybe this is a case of the Michaelis-Arburn reaction? Or perhaps it's a case of the formation of a ylide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: red phosphorus with HI is often used for the dehydrohalogenation or perhaps elimination. Wait, no, I think when you have a carbonyl group, like an aldehyde or ketone, and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to the formation of an alkane via a reaction called the Kharasch reaction? Or wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's about the addition of HI to the carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: I remember that when a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde) reacts with HI, it can undergo a nucleophilic addition. For example, HI can add to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a diiodide. But with red phosphorus present, perhaps it's a different scenario. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent, sometimes used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, but under specific conditions.

Wait, another angle. The starting material has a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), as substituents on a cyclohexene ring. So, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the formyl group is being modified. I recall that in some cases, the formyl group can be converted to a methyl group. How? Oh, wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces a formyl group to a CH2 group, using Zn(Hg)/HCl. But that's a different reagent. Alternatively, in the presence of HI and a reducing agent like red phosphorus, perhaps the formyl group is reduced.

Wait, or maybe it's a question of addition to double bonds. The starting material has multiple double bonds. The reaction conditions involve HI and red phosphorus. I think red phosphorus can help in the addition of HI to alkenes, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but no, that's usually with OsO4. Wait, another thought: when you have an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system, like a conjugated enone, treating it with HI can lead to a 1,2-addition (Michael addition) or perhaps a 1,4-addition. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, the starting compound has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a vinyl substituent (another double bond), and a formyl group (third double bond). So, three double bonds in total. Now, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, I think that might cause the reduction of some of these double bonds.

Wait, red phosphorus is a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to a CH2OH group? Or maybe further reduction, like to a CH3 group? Wait, the Clemmensen reduction reduces the formyl to a methylene group, but under what conditions?

Alternatively, when HI and red phosphorus are used together, perhaps they effect the addition of iodide to double bonds. For example, in the presence of a diene, HI can add to the double bond. But considering the starting molecule, which has multiple double bonds, perhaps some of them are getting hydrogenated or iodinated.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the Birch reduction, but that uses ammonia and a metal like Na or Mg. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogenation reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a hydrohalogenation of the double bonds. But HI is a strong acid and can act as an electrophilic source, leading to additions.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the possible products. Let's think about each substituent.

The starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-) and a cyclohexene ring.

Red phosphorus and HI: I recall that when alkenes are treated with HI, they undergo addition reactions. For example, in the case of a simple alkene, HI would add across the double bond in an acid-catalyzed mechanism, leading to the formation of a diiodide. But in the presence of red phosphorus, maybe the reaction is different. Red phosphorus can sometimes be used to reduce carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into a methylene group. Let me think: if the formyl (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH, that would be a primary alcohol. But with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's reduced further. Wait, the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. But if red phosphorus is used with HI, perhaps it can perform a similar function, but maybe not as strong a reducing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Wittig reaction, but the conditions usually involve an ylide. Red phosphorus and HI might be part of that, but I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, consider the possibility that the starting material has conjugated double bonds. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3, the formyl group has a double bond at position 2 (as CHO), and the vinyl group at position 5 has a double bond. So, the molecule might have conjugated double bonds, making the structure more reactive.

Wait, perhaps the conjugated diene could undergo some addition. Wait, but the starting molecule doesn't have a conjugated diene, because the cyclohexene is at position 3, and the vinyl group is at position 5. So, maybe they're not conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation of the cyclohexene ring, but that's probably done with OsO4, not HI.

Another angle: maybe the formyl group is undergoing some reaction. For example, in the presence of HI, the formyl group could undergo an acid-catalyzed addition. So, HI could add to the carbonyl group, making it a diiodide. Wait, but when you add HI to a carbonyl, typically you get a geminal dihalide. For example, RCHO + HI → RCH(I)OH, but then maybe further reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is being converted into a CH2I group. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the vinyl group. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which could add HI. So, when HI adds to a vinyl group (a double bond), it would form a vicinal diiodide. So, CH2=CH- would become CH2I-CH2I after addition. But wait, no. For a simple alkene, adding HI would typically add across the double bond, so CH2=CH2 + HI → CH2I-CH2I? No, wait, that's two equivalents. Wait, actually, the addition of HI to an alkene like propene would form a diiodide, but perhaps in the case of a cyclic structure, the addition would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not adding to the double bonds but rather breaking them. For example, in some cases, HI can cause elimination reactions if there are adjacent leaving groups, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the overall reaction's effect. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, they can be used to reduce certain groups, like nitro groups, but again, not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a demethylation or some other functional group transformation. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the double bonds, but I don't think HI would do that.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but with excess HI, that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is adding iodide to the double bonds, leading to diiodinated products, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehalogenation, but I don't see any halogens in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydrogenation, but red phosphorus isn't a hydrogen source. Wait, but maybe the HI provides H+ and I-.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to approach it from the product's structure. The starting material has a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a cyclohexene ring with a double bond. After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what could happen to each of these groups?

Let's consider each substituent:

1. The cyclohexene ring (double bond at C3 and C4): When treated with HI, perhaps this double bond will add HI. So, the cyclohexene would become a cyclohexane with two adjacent iodine atoms. But wait, adding HI to a cyclohexene would produce 3-iodocyclohexene? No, wait, adding HI would break the double bond and add an I to each carbon. So, the cyclohexene would become a diiodide, like 3,4-diiodo cyclohexane.

Wait, but if the ring is adding HI, that would change the structure. But then, considering the other substituents, it's getting complicated.

2. The formyl group (CHO): Maybe the formyl group is being reduced. If we have a reducing agent like red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the aldehyde is being reduced to a primary alcohol (CH2OH) or further to a CH3 group. But wait, what's the usual reagent for that? Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but perhaps red phosphorus and HI can do a similar thing. Maybe the CHO is reduced to CH2I.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is undergoing an addition of HI, leading to a geminal diiodide, but then maybe further reactions.

3. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-): Perhaps this is also adding HI, leading to a diiodide. So, the vinyl group would become CH2I-CH2I. But wait, the vinyl group is substituted on the cyclohexene ring. Adding HI would break the double bond, leading to a vicinal diiodide.

But then, the product would have the cyclohexane ring (if the double bond was saturated), and the substituents would have added iodine.

Wait, but if all the double bonds are saturated by adding HI, then the product would have more single bonds. So, the index of hydrogen deficiency would decrease.

Let me count the initial double bonds again. The starting material has:

- One double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

- One double bond in the formyl group (CHO).

- One double bond in the vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

So, three double bonds. Each of these could potentially be reduced or hydrogenated.

If all three are hydrogenated, the product would have no double bonds, leading to an index of hydrogen deficiency of zero.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps all the double bonds are being saturated.

Let me think: the cyclohexene ring's double bond would be hydrogenated (or added HI), the formyl group's double bond would be hydrogenated, and the vinyl group's double bond would be hydrogenated.

So, if all three double bonds are converted to single bonds, the index of hydrogen deficiency would be zero.

But wait, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. The -COOH group. The reaction conditions are with HI and red phosphorus. Could that affect the carboxylic acid group? I don't think so, because carboxylic acids are generally resistant to nucleophilic attack unless under very strong conditions. But in this case, perhaps the reaction isn't affecting the -COOH group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't affect all the double bonds. For example, perhaps only the formyl group is reduced.

Wait, another approach: the product after the reaction. What's the structure after treatment with red phosphorus and HI?

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Reaction with red phosphorus and HI: Maybe this is a case of the Stork enamine reaction, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the double bonds. For each double bond, adding HI would add two iodines and two hydrogens. So, each double bond is saturated, turning into a single bond with two I atoms added.

So, for the cyclohexene ring, the double bond would become a single bond, with each adjacent carbon getting an I. Similarly, the formyl double bond would become a single bond, perhaps adding I on each side, and the vinyl group's double bond would be saturated.

Wait, but in that case, each double bond would lead to two I atoms added. But how does that affect the overall structure? Each addition would reduce the degree of unsaturation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is leading to the formation of alkenes via elimination, but that doesn't make sense with HI.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is causing the formyl group to be reduced. So, the aldehyde (CHO) is converted to CH2OH (a primary alcohol), but under these conditions, perhaps it's further reduced to CH3 (a methyl group). But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, wait, I think I've heard of a reaction where formyl groups are reduced to methylene groups using red phosphorus and HI. So, maybe the formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH2I. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a more general addition across all double bonds. Let me think: if each double bond is added to with HI, each would become a single bond with I added to both carbons.

So, the cyclohexene ring's double bond (C3-C4) would become a single bond, with I added to each, making it a diiodide. The formyl group's double bond (C=O) would become a single bond, perhaps adding I to the carbonyl carbon, turning into an iodide. Wait, but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group would add HI across the C=O, making a geminal diiodide (C(I)=O with two I's added?), but that doesn't make much sense. Perhaps it would become a CH2I group.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is being reduced to a CH2 group. So, CHO → CH2OH, but in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's further reduced to CH3.

If that's the case, the formyl group is converted to a CH3 group, which doesn't have any double bonds. Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) could be converted to CH2-CH2, but with I added. Wait, no, adding HI to the vinyl group would make CH2I-CH2I, which would replace the double bond with a single bond and add two I's. So, the vinyl group's double bond is gone, contributing to the index.

Similarly, the cyclohexene ring's double bond is converted to a single bond, adding two I's.

So, after the reaction, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond, so the ring count for the index goes down by one).

- The formyl group is now a CH3 group (no double bond, so another minus one).

- The vinyl group is now a CH2-I-CH2-I group? No, wait, I think the vinyl group, when adding HI, becomes CH2-CH2 with I's. Wait, perhaps it becomes CH2I-CH2I after adding HI. But that would be a diiodide, and the double bond is gone, so no contribution to the index.

Each of these changes reduces the index. The original index was 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds). Wait, no, let me recalculate.

Wait, the original molecule's structure: cyclohexene has a ring and a double bond. Wait, wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, that's one ring and one double bond. Then, the formyl group has a double bond (C=O), and the vinyl group has a double bond (CH2=CH-). So, in total, 1 ring and 3 double bonds → degree of unsaturation = 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) = 4.

After the reaction, if all double bonds are saturated:

- The ring remains as a cyclohexane (no double bond, so no contribution to the index).

Wait, no—if the cyclohexene's double bond is saturated, the ring becomes a cyclohexane, which is a single ring (no double bond), so that's one ring, which counts as one degree.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ring itself is a degree of unsaturation. Even if the ring has no double bonds, it's still a ring, counting as one degree. So, if the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, the ring is still present, so it's one degree, but the double bond is gone, so the index decreases by one.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the degree of unsaturation formula.

The formula is: Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

In the starting material, let's count the atoms.

But maybe it's easier to think about the initial structure.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The formula would be C9H8O3? Let me check: cyclohexene is C6H10. The formyl group is CHO (adds one C, one O), and the vinyl group is CH2CH2–, but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH–, which adds two C and three H (since it's attached as a substituent). Wait, maybe I should write the molecular formula.

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Adding a formyl group (CHO) at position 2: adds one C, one O, and no H (since it's substituting a H).

Adding a vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at position 5: adds two C and one H (since it's substituting a H). Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which is two carbons and three hydrogens (since one H is attached to the ring). So, the molecular formula would be:

C6 (from cyclohexene) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = C9.

Hydrogen: 10 (cyclohexene) - 2 (removed H for substituents) + (formyl doesn't add H) + (vinyl adds 3 H) → 10 -2 +3=11? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the formula.

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Adding a formyl group (CHO) as a substituent. The formula becomes C7H9O.

Adding a vinyl group (CH2=CH–) as a substituent. So, adding two more C and three H (since the substituent is CH2=CH–, which is two C, two H from CH2 and one H from the CH–, but I'm getting confused. Maybe the vinyl group is -CH2CH2- but with a double bond, so the substituent is CH2=CH–, which is two C and three H (since each CH2 has two H and the CH has one H, but one H is attached to the ring).

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H8O2? Wait, perhaps I should count each part:

The cyclohexene ring is C6H10.

The formyl group is -CHO: adds one C, one O, and no H (since it's a substituent replacing an H).

The vinyl group is -CH2CH2– but with a double bond, so it's -CH2=CH–, which adds two C and one H (since the substituent is attached to the ring, so the structure is -CH2CH2– with a double bond. So, the formula should be C6 + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = C9.

Hydrogens: cyclohexene is 10 H. Adding formyl (-CHO) would replace one H, so 10 -1 =9. Adding vinyl (-CH2=CH–) would add three H (since the substituent is CH2=CH–, which has three H attached). So, 9 +3 =12 H.

Plus, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) adds two O and two H (since it's a substituent). Wait, no, the carboxylic acid is part of the ring?

Wait, no, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or position ?

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to think that the cyclohexene has substituents at positions 2 (formyl), 3 (double bond), and 5 (vinyl), and the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps. But I'm not certain about the exact positions, but the formula would be C9H8O3.

Wait, let's think: the cyclohexene is C6H10. Each substituent (formyl, vinyl) adds carbons and hydrogens.

Formyl group: -CHO → 1 C, 1 O, 0 H added (since it's replacing a H on the ring). So, from C6H10 → C7H9O.

Vinyl group: -CH2=CH– → adds 2 C and 3 H (since the substituent is -CH2-CH2–, but with a double bond, it's -CH2-CH2– but with the double bond, so perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2–, but that's ethyl. Wait, no, the substituent is -CH2=CH–, which is 2 C, and the substituent adds three H (since the substituent structure is CH2=CH–, which has three H: each CH2 has two H, and the CH has one H, but one H is attached to the ring). So, adding this would make C7+2= C9, H9+3=12. Then, the carboxylic acid is at another position, so that's another O.

Wait, the formula for the starting material would be C9H8O3? Or perhaps C9H8O2? I'm getting a bit stuck on the formula, but perhaps I can proceed without it.

Assuming the product, after reaction, has all the double bonds saturated.

If all three double bonds are gone, the degrees of unsaturation would be:

- One ring (from the cyclohexane) → 1.

So, the index would be 1. But wait, the initial index was 4, but if all the double bonds are gone, index would be 1 (from the ring).

Wait, but wait. The starting material has a cyclohexene ring, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, that's one degree from the ring and one from the double bond, totaling two from the ring part. Then, the substituents have two more double bonds (formyl and vinyl), so total degrees of unsaturation is 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds). If all three double bonds are saturated, the product would have only the ring, so degrees of unsaturation would be 1.

Wait, but if the cyclohexene ring remains as a ring with a single bond, then it contributes one degree of unsaturation. The formyl group's double bond is gone, the vinyl group's double bond is gone, so the product has only the ring. So, index is 1.

But looking at the options, option A is 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the ring remains. Because when you hydrogenate a ring, you can open it, but that's more in cases like hydrogenation of aromatic rings. But in this case, the starting ring is a cyclohexene, not an aromatic ring. Adding hydrogen would saturate the double bond, turning it into a cyclohexane (single bonds), so the ring remains.

So, the ring is still present, contributing one degree. The formyl and vinyl groups' double bonds are gone, contributing zero. So, the index is 1.

Wait, but the options include 0. So, maybe there's another change.

Wait, perhaps the reaction also breaks the ring. How?

Hydrogenation of cyclohexene would turn it into cyclohexane. The ring is still a ring; it hasn't opened, so the degree of unsaturation from the ring remains at one.

But maybe the reaction doesn't just add HI to the double bonds but opens the ring. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring. Let me think: the reaction conditions are with HI and red phosphorus. Could the ring be opening? Probably not, unless under very strong conditions, which I don't think are present here.

So, the product would have a cyclohexane ring (contributing 1 to the index), and all other double bonds would be gone. So, the index is 1.

But let me look at the options again. Option A is 1. So, that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another possibility: perhaps the reaction is not adding HI to the double bonds but instead reducing them. For example, turning double bonds into single bonds but leaving the ring intact.

In that case, the degrees of unsaturation would be 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction also removes the ring. For example, if the cyclohexane ring is opened, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another thing: the starting material is a carboxylic acid. After reaction, perhaps the -COOH group is transformed. But I don't think HI and red phosphorus would affect the carboxylic acid group. It's generally quite stable.

So, putting it all together, the product would have a cyclohexane ring (1 degree), and all other double bonds (formyl and vinyl) converted to single bonds. So, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1, which is option A.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule, with each contributing one to the index.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:
   - The molecule contains a cyclohexene ring (C6H10), which has one double bond and forms a six-membered ring.
   - A formyl group (-CHO) is attached at position 2, contributing one additional double bond.
   - A vinyl group (-CH2=CH-) is attached at position 5, contributing another double bond.
   - The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) does not contribute to unsaturation.

   Thus, the starting material has:
   - **1 ring** (from the cyclohexene).
   - **3 double bonds** (1 from the cyclohexene ring, 1 from the formyl group, and 1 from the vinyl group).

   The initial index of hydrogen deficiency is therefore **4**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents that can reduce double bonds. In this reaction:
     - The cyclohexene ring's double bond is saturated, converting the ring into a cyclohexane (a saturated six-membered ring).
     - The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-), eliminating its double bond.
     - The vinyl group (-CH2=CH-) is also reduced, saturating its double bond.

   After the reaction, all three double bonds are eliminated, leaving only the cyclohexane ring intact.

3. **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product**:
   - The product contains one six-membered cyclohexane ring, which contributes **1 degree of unsaturation**.
   - All double bonds are removed, so no additional degrees of unsaturation are present.

   Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**, corresponding to the cyclohexane ring.

ANSWER: A
