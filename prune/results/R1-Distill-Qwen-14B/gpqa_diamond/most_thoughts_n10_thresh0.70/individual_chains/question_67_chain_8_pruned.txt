Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum for this question. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for particles 1 and 2. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the Z component of the total angular momentum.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z (the z-components of their orbital angular momenta) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. The options are A) 2/3, B) 1, C) 1/2, D) 0.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Since they're in p orbitals, l is 1 for each. So l₁=1 and l₂=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is the sum of l₁ and l₂ when they're aligned. So in this case, l = 2, which makes sense because 1 + 1 = 2.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So m is -1. Wait, m is the total z-component of the angular momentum. So the total Mz is -ħ.

But the question is about the individual L₁z and L₂z measurements. Each of these has eigenvalues m₁ħ and m₂ħ, respectively. The total Mz is mħ = m₁ħ + m₂ħ. So in our case, m is -1. So m₁ + m₂ = -1.

We're to find the probability that both m₁ and m₂ are -1. Because L₁z and L₂z are each mħ, so if m₁ is -1, then L₁z is -ħ, same for L₂z.

So we're looking for the probability that m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1.

But wait, the total m is m₁ + m₂ = -1. So if both m₁ and m₂ are -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1. That suggests that such a state isn't possible. Because in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1. So the individual m's can't add up to more than that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible ways to get m_total = -1 from m₁ and m₂ each being 1, 0, or -1.

Let me think about all possible combinations of m₁ and m₂ that sum to -1.

Possible m₁ and m₂ pairs:
(1, -2) → but wait, m can't be less than -l. Since l=1, m can be -1, 0, or 1. So m₂ can't be -2. So this
