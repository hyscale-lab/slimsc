Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. Wait, what's the molecular formula here? C10H14. Let me think, benzene has six carbons. So each compound must have four substituents because 6 (benzene) + 4 (substituents) = 10 carbons. Oh wait, each substituent is probably an ethyl group because, for example, if it's a methyl group, each would add one carbon. Wait, no: each substituent in the benzene ring is probably a methyl or ethyl group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. Each substituent adds a certain number of carbons and hydrogens. Let me think, for each substituent R attached to benzene, the formula becomes C6H5â€“R. So the entire molecule would be C6 + (n carbons from substituents) H(5 + 2n + ... wait, maybe an easier way is to compute the degree of unsaturation.

C10H14: Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. Benzene ring is three (since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds), so the substituents must account for one more. Wait, no. Benzene itself has three degrees (one ring and three double bonds). So the substituents must contribute one more. So the substituents probably have a double bond or a ring, but since they're on a benzene, maybe they are all single bonds. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is an ethyl group, which are single bonds.

Wait, each substituent is a methyl group. Let's see: benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups would be C6 + 4*(CH3) = C10H14. Oh, because each methyl adds one
