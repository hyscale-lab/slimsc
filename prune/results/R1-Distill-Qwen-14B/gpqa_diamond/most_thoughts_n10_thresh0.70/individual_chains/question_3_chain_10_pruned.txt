Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a spin-half particle. Hmm, I remember that spin-half particles are like electrons, right? And their spin states can be described using the Pauli matrices.

The particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So the first thing I think is that I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

I think the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. Since the operator is a sum, I can split it into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes sense because expectation is linear.

Let me write down the state ψ. ψ is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, I should check the normalization. Let me see: |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which adds up to 1. So it's already normalized. Good, no need to worry about that.

First, calculate ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is just the weighted sum of their eigenvalues. So σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. 

The state ψ is a combination of these. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Calculating that: 0.25 *1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Next, I need ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is off-diagonal. The expectation value of σx for a state that's a combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ can be found by calculating ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, I remember that σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but for a state that's a superposition, it's not as straightforward. Hmm, let me think about how to compute it.

The general formula for ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ. So let me write ψ as a column vector. Let's see: usually |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ is 0.5*(1,0) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0,1) = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, no, wait, the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩
