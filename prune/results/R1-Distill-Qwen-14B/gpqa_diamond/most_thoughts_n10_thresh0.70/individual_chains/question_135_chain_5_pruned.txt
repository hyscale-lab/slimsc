Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question is about the possible decays of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV. I'm supposed to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Hmm, okay. So, from what I remember, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and fermions. The term involves ψ_f, which are fermion fields. The interaction term is like λ f X ψ̄ ψ, I think. So X is coupling to fermions, and that's the force carrier, similar to how W or Z bosons interact with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when it decays, the energy has to be enough to produce the fermion-antifermion pair. The mass of the boson needs to be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair because each fermion has mass m, and the pair is 2m. So the rest mass of X must be greater than or equal to 2m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion.

Wait, but wait, the fermions in the Lagrangian are given as ψ_f. So I need to know what fermions are present. The question doesn't specify, but since it's a general Lagrangian, I guess it's for any fermion species. So the possible decay products would be any fermion-antifermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So first, I'll list all possible fermion species that have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV each, since 2m <=6 GeV implies m <=3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The charged leptons are: electrons (mass ~0.0005 GeV), muons (~0.1 GeV), taus (~1.78 GeV). The neutrinos are even lighter, but they're neutral leptons, and in this case, the interaction is with charged leptons maybe? Wait, the Lagrangian has ψ_f, which I think refers to fermion species. Since the term is ψ_f, which is a Dirac spinor, but the exact type depends on what's in the model. But given that the options include things like e+ e-, mu pairs, tau pairs, etc., I think the boson X can decay into any charged lepton pair and any quark pair.

Wait, but wait. The fermions in the interaction term are ψ_f, which could be quarks or leptons. So for X to decay into a pair, the fermion must be part of the model.

So possible fermions are quarks and leptons. Let's list the masses:

Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible, but since the interaction is with ψ_f, which is a charged lepton? Or maybe including neutrinos? Wait, the term is (ῡ + X), so maybe ψ_f is a charged lepton, because ψ_f would then be like a charged fermion. Because
