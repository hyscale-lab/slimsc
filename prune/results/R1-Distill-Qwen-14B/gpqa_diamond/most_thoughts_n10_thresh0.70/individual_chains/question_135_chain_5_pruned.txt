Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf ψ_f bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I need to parse this correctly. Oh, right, the structure is L = -λ ψ_f† (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I think that's a Yukawa coupling term. So the boson X is interacting with a fermion ψ_f, right? 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. 

So, I remember that in particle physics, when a boson decays, it has to produce particles whose combined mass is less than the mass of the boson. But wait, no, the decay products can't exceed the mass of the decaying particle. So for X to decay into two particles, their rest masses must each be less than or equal to X's mass divided by 2. Because each would have some kinetic energy, but the maximum mass each can have is when the other is at rest. So for each fermion pair, the mass of the fermion times 2 must be less than or equal to X's mass.

Wait, but wait. The boson X is being considered for decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, like f f-bar. So each f has a rest mass m_f. So the condition is 2 m_f ≤ m_X.

So the mass of the fermion must be ≤ 3 GeV (since m_X is 6 GeV, so 6/2 =3 GeV). 

Now, looking at the fermion masses. Let me list out the known fermion masses:

- Up quark: m_u ≈ 2 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
- Down quark: m_d ≈ 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: m_s ≈ 95-100 MeV
- Charm quark: m_c ≈ 1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: m_b ≈ 4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark: m_t ≈ 173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Electron: m_e ≈ 0.0005 GeV
- Muon: m_mu ≈ 0.1 GeV
- Tau: m_tau ≈ 1.78 GeV
- Also, neutrinos are very light, but their masses are negligible, so they're probably not relevant here.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let's see:

Electron, muon, tau: all under 3 GeV. So their anti-pairs would be allowed. For quarks, up, down, strange, charm, but bottom is 4.5 GeV, which is above 3 GeV, so no. So quarks would be u, d, s, c. But wait, wait. Also, the fermion must be in the
