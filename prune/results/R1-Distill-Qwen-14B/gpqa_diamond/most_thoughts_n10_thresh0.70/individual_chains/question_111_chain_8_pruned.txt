Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of reactions. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I need to figure out the major products for each based on steric hindrance and product stability.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So I remember that when a ketone reacts with a base, especially a bulky one, it's likely an enolate formation. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, so maybe this is an example of a conjugate addition or a Michael addition?

Wait, no, wait—Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, maybe the base deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate, which then attacks the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation? But that usually involves an aromatic aldehyde and ketone, maybe not applicable here.

Wait, another thought: ethyl acrylate could be acting as a Michael acceptor here. So, the enolate of the cyclohexanone would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

But wait, cyclohexanone with substituents—2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1, and substituents at positions 2 and 6. Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl, and position 6 has a methyl. So, the substituents are in such a way that the ketone is in position 1, and the ring has substituents at positions 2
