Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, so it's a solid at room temperature but just barely. 

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. I know some common reagents like NaOH, maybe something else. 

The question is asking about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X. So, I need to figure out what elements are in X, particularly its isotopes, and then sum the lightest and heaviest.

Let me think about the reaction part. The reaction of X with Y produces gas W and precipitate G. Gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Hmm. Let me think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton each, but no neutrons. So that doesn't fit. What about CO2? No, that has 12 C (protons=6, neutrons=6) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). Wait, wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons are equal. So each atom in the molecule must have equal protons and neutrons, or the total for the molecule does?

Wait, the question says the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. So maybe the entire molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. For example, H2O has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and 1 O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 8. Not equal. What about CO2? Each CO2 molecule has C (6p,6n) and two O (8p,8n each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh, that's equal! So W could be CO2. But then, under what conditions would X react with Y to produce CO2?

Wait, but if X is a substance that reacts with Y to release CO2, then perhaps X is a carbonate. But wait, another possibility: maybe W is another gas. Let me think of other options. Another possibility is CH4. Let's see: C has 6p,6n, H has 1p,0n. So molecule has 6+4=10p, 6+0=6n. Not equal. So that's no good. How about CH3NH2? Not sure, but maybe. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something else. 

Wait, another common gas is O2. O2 has 8p each, so 16 total protons. Neutrons are 8 each *2 =16. So total protons 16, neutrons 16. Oh, that's equal. So W could be O2. But why would X reacting with Y produce O2? Hmm, maybe if X is a peroxide, but peroxides decompose to produce O2. Alternatively, perhaps X is a chlorate or something else. Wait, another thought: when metals react with strong acids, sometimes they produce H2 gas. But H2 has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. 

Wait, going back to CO2. How would X and Y react to produce CO2? Maybe X is a carbonate and Y is an acid. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is HCl, they would react to produce CO2, NaCl, and water. So if that's the case, gas W is CO2. 

Then, the precipitate G forms. So what's the precipitate here? If Y is HCl and X is Na2CO3, the reaction is Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2 + H2O. But in that case, the solution would have NaCl and water, but no precipitate. Wait, but perhaps Y is not HCl. Maybe Y is another acid that would cause a precipitate. Or perhaps X is a sulfate or something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal nitrate reacting with Y, which is maybe a stronger base. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is an aqueous solution of a metal hydroxide, and X is an acid. Let's think: if X is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and Y is NaOH. They would react to produce Na2SO4, water, and maybe some heat. But that wouldn't produce a precipitate. Unless the product is insoluble. Hmm.

Wait, the precipitate G is formed, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K, so that's just above 0 C. So B is a solid. What's a common solid that is produced when something is heated? Maybe a metal oxide. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it might decompose. Wait, if G is a carbonate, upon heating, it could break down into CO2 and the metal oxide. Like, suppose G is CaCO3. Heating it would produce CaO (which has a melting point around 2600 K, so that's way higher than 277 K. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is something else. 

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. Let me think about this. Keto acids are like RCOOH, right? So when a keto acid reacts with a base (like X), perhaps it undergoes a neutralization reaction to form a salt. The product would then be a carboxylate salt. So, for example, if the keto acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH) and X is NaOH, the product would be CH3COONa. The sodium salt of acetic acid. The product has O in the COO- group. Let me count the O in the product. The formula is CH3COONa: each acetate has two O in the COO- group plus the O from the acetate. Wait, CH3COO^- is C2H3O2^- (but wait, CH3COO^- is actually C2H3O2^-? No, wait, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, which is C2H4O2. When it loses a proton, it becomes CH3COO^-. So the formula is C2H3O2^-. So the product would have two O from the acetate. So the product has two O atoms. So the product of X and the keto acid contains two O atoms. 

So X is likely a strong base. Because when a base reacts with a keto acid, it neutralizes to form a salt and water. So X could be NaOH, KOH, or something similar. But the problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, if X is NaOH, perhaps the sodium is a heavier isotope, like Na-23 (which is the most common) but some heavier isotopes exist, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if X is KOH, potassium has several isotopes, including K-41, K-39, etc. 

Wait, but the product of X and a keto acid is a salt with two O atoms. Let me think: the general formula for a carboxylate salt is RCOO-M+, where M is a metal cation. The acetate ion is CH3COO^-, which has two O atoms. So the product would have two O atoms. That fits. 

So if X is a hydroxide, like NaOH, then when it reacts with a keto acid, you get a carboxylate salt. So X is probably NaOH. Or KOH. Let's think about the heavier isotope part. Sodium has two main isotopes: Na-23 (about 100% abundance) and some minor ones. But the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps X has an isotope of, say, hydrogen. Wait, but NaOH is Na+ OH-. Hydrogen in OH- is H. The common isotope is H, but there's also D (deuterium), which is heavier. So if X has deuterium, then it's a heavier isotope. 

But wait, the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X is, say, NaOH, the heavier isotope could be in the Na or in the H. If it's Na, but the common Na isotope is Na-23. To get a heavier isotope, perhaps it's Na-25 (but that's rare, about 2.6% abundance). Or if the H is deuterium (D), that's a heavier isotope. 

Now, going back to the reaction with Y. If X is NaOH and Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, earlier I thought that when X reacts with Y, it produces CO2. So if X is NaOH, what would Y be to produce CO2? Maybe Y is a carbonate salt. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base, so if Y is a carbonate, the reaction would be NaOH + Na2CO3 → Na3CO3? No, that's not right. Or maybe Y is carbon dioxide itself. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is carbonated water, but that would just produce Na2CO3 and water, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: the precipitate G. So X and Y react to form G and W (gas). Let's imagine that Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate. For example, if X is AgNO3 and Y is NaCl, they would form AgCl precipitate. But wait, if X is AgNO3, which is a nitrate, and Y is NaCl, then the reaction would produce AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. But NaNO3 is soluble. So W would be nothing much, unless maybe gas is released. Hmm. Alternatively, if X is a hydroxide and Y is a sulfate, like BaSO4. Wait, but BaSO4 is already a precipitate.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH, Y is CuSO4. Then the reaction would produce Na2SO4 and Cu(OH)2 as precipitate. So G is Cu(OH)2. Then when G is heated, it might decompose into CuO and water. But the melting point of B (the product upon heating G) is 277 K. Wait, CuO has a melting point of about 2200°C, which is way higher than 277 K (about 4°C). So that can't be. 

Hmm, maybe B is something with a lower melting point. Let's think of a substance that is solid at 277 K. Like ice, but ice melts at 273 K. Close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. Wait, so B's melting point is around 4°C. What solid has a melting point just above 0°C? Water (ice) melts at 0°C (273 K). Maybe B is water, but that doesn't fit because when G is heated, it releases B. No, because heating G would produce B. If G is a carbonate, heating it would release CO2 and form an oxide. But earlier, I thought that B would be the oxide, which is solid. Wait, another thought: maybe B is NaCl? No, that's a solid with a higher melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium carbonate? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, let's try a different approach. Let's think about the isotopes. The problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has elements, each with their own isotopes. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, one of which has isotopes, and the other doesn't. Or both have isotopes.

Looking at the options, the answers are 35, 25, 31, 29. These are probably the sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic masses in X. 

Wait, what if X is H2O? But no, because the product with keto acid would have more O. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3. No, but how would that react with Y? 

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal hydride. For example, NaH. Sodium hydride is a strong base. When NaH reacts with a keto acid, it would deprotonate it to form the carboxylate salt. So the product would have O. That fits the second condition. 

So if X is NaH, then the elements in X are Na and H. The lightest isotope of H is protium (H), and the heavier could be deuterium. But wait, if X is NaH, which element has isotopes? Both Na and H have isotopes. So the lightest element in X is H, and the heaviest is Na. The cumulative atomic masses would be H (1.007) + Na (22.99) = about 24. So that's not matching any of the options. Unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, X could be NaOH. The elements are Na, O, H. The lightest would be H (1), the heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 24, but options don't include 24. Hmm. 

Wait, the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. So perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements are Cl and Na? Let me think. Cl has a higher atomic mass. If X is NaCl, but then the reaction with Y would have to produce CO2. Not sure. 

Wait, another angle. Let's think of the gas W as CO2. So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So X must have a carbonate or a compound that can release CO3^2- when reacted. Alternatively, maybe X is a bicarbonate. 

Wait, if X is sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), then reacting with an acid would release CO2. So Y could be HCl. Reaction: NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. That would produce gas W as CO2. Then precipitate G would form if another reaction occurs. Wait, but in this case, the product is NaCl, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit. 

Wait, perhaps Y is another solution. For instance, if Y is a solution of CaCl2 and X is Na2CO3. Then the reaction would produce CaCO3 precipitate and NaCl. Gas W would be CO2? No, wait, if it's a carbonate reacting with a chloride, perhaps it doesn't produce gas. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal carbonate, and X is an acid. For example, X is H2SO4, Y is CaCO3. Then the reaction would produce CO2 gas, CaSO4 (which is a precipitate, but it's soluble? No, CaSO4 is slightly soluble, so would it precipitate? Maybe under certain conditions.) 

But I'm not making much progress on this part. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal oxide. For example, sodium oxide. But sodium oxide reacts with water to form NaOH, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, like potassium carbonate. So when X reacts with Y (maybe an acid), it produces CO2. The precipitate G could be if another reaction forms an insoluble salt. For example, if Y is another carbonate, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a carbonate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, Y is Fe(OH)3, and X is H2SO4. Then the reaction would produce Fe3(SO4)3, water, and perhaps some gas. No, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, so reaction would produce Fe^3+ ions, which might precipitate if concentration is high, but I'm not sure about gas release. 

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate, and Y is an acid. Then CO2 is released. But again, the precipitate part is unclear.

Let me try to think about the precipitate G and what it forms when heated. The heating of G produces B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. So B is solid at around 4°C. What compounds are solids near that temperature? Perhaps a metal hydroxide? Or a carbonate? Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium bicarbonate, but that's not solid at that temperature.

Wait, another thought: if G is a carbonate, heating it would decompose to produce CO2 and a metal oxide. So B would be the metal oxide. But earlier, I thought of Na2O, but its melting point is way above 277 K. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrated salt. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point lower than the anhydrous form. But I'm not sure if that's around 277 K. Alternatively, maybe B is something like a metal bicarbonate, but that's probably not stable upon heating.

Wait, perhaps B is water. No, because it's a solid, but water melts at 273 K, so at 277 K it's just above the melting point. But B is the product of heating G. So maybe G is a hydrate that, when heated, releases water. For example, a copper sulfate hydrate. When heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous copper sulfate, which is a solid. The melting point of anhydrous copper sulfate is about 1584°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Hmm.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So if X is something like NH3, the elements are N and H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is N (14). Sum is 15. Not matching options. If X is CH4, sum is C (12) + H (1) =13. No.

Wait, another thought: if X is a hydroxide like KOH. Then elements are K and O and H. The lightest is H (1), the heaviest is K (~39). Sum would be 1 + 39=40. Not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2 or something. Or maybe X is something else entirely.

Wait, the product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. Let's think of X as a metal, perhaps. For example, if X is Mg metal, and the keto acid is acetic acid. The reaction would produce Mg acetate, which has O. Let's see, Mg(OAc)2 would have four O atoms. Hmm, not two. Alternatively, maybe X is a base without O, like NaH.

Wait, earlier I thought X could be NaH, a strong base. When NaH reacts with a keto acid, it deprotonates it to form the carboxylate. So, for example, reacting with acetic acid (CH3COOH) would give CH3COO^- Na^+ and H2. Wait, but NaH is H^- Na^+; when it reacts with CH3COOH:

CH3COOH + NaH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2.

Wait, but the product is the sodium salt of acetic acid. The formula is CH3COONa. So that's sodium acetate. The acetate ion has two O atoms in the COO^- group. So the product has two O atoms. That matches the condition in the problem. So X is NaH, a strong base.

So, X is NaH. Now, the elements in X are Na and H. Sodium's atomic mass is about 22.99, and hydrogen is about 1.008. So the lightest element is H, and the heaviest is Na. So their cumulative atomic masses would be 22.99 + 1.008 = ~24, which isn't one of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I'm wrong about X being NaH.

Alternatively, perhaps X is another compound. Let's think of X as a carbonate. If X is Na2CO3, let's see. Reacting with Y (maybe an acid) produces CO2. For example, if Y is HCl, then the reaction is Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2 + H2O. So the gas W is CO2. The precipitate G would form if another product is insoluble. But in this case, all products are soluble (NaCl, water), so no precipitate. So maybe Y is a solution that forms a precipitate when reacted with X.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of CaCl2, and X is Na2CO3. Then the reaction would produce CaCO3 precipitate and NaCl. So G would be CaCO3. Then, when G is heated, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. So B would be CaO. The melting point of CaO is about 2600 K, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let me think of the cumulative atomic masses. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Let's see what combinations could give these sums.

Option A: 35. Possible elements: Cl (35.5) and H (1), sum 36.5 (no). Or maybe Cl and another element. Wait, 35 could be Cl (35.5) but rounded down. Alternatively, maybe Cl and O. Cl is about 35.5, O is 16. Sum would be 51.5, which is not an option. 

Option B: 25. Could be O (16) and F (19), sum 35. No. Or maybe Na (23) and O (16), sum 39. Not matching. Wait, H (1) and something else. 1 + 24=25. 24 is Mg. So H and Mg. If X has H and Mg, like MgH2. But would that make sense? Hmm. 

Option C: 31. Possible combinations: O (16) and S (32.1), sum 48. No. Or P (31) and H (1), but 32 is not 31. Alternatively, Cl (35.5) and O (16), sum 51.5. No. Alternatively, Mg (24) and O (16), sum 40. Hmm.

Option D: 29. Possible combinations: Na (23) and O (16), sum 39. No. Or maybe Mg (24) and O (16), sum 40. Hmm. Alternatively, if X has elements like F (19) and O (16), sum 35. No. 

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses. The problem says to sum the lightest and heaviest atomic masses in X, considering all instances. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean that each element's isotopes are summed and then the lightest and heaviest elements are considered? Or does it mean find the lightest and heaviest elements in X, sum their atomic masses, considering all isotopes?

The question states: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

So, for each element in X, sum all their isotopes' masses. Then, among all elements in X, find the lightest and heaviest, and sum their cumulative masses.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me rephrase. Suppose X has elements A and B. For each element, sum all the possible isotopes' masses. For example, if X has hydrogen (H), which has H, D, T, etc., each with their own atomic masses, but the question says to "sum" all. But wait, that's not how isotopic masses work. Maybe it's considering the most common isotopes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for each element present in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopic masses, then sum those for the lightest and heaviest elements.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of an example. Suppose X is NaOH. The elements are Na, O, H.

For each element:

- Na: isotopes include Na-23 (most abundant, ~100%), Na-24, Na-25. The lightest is Na-23 (23), the heaviest is Na-25 (~25). So sum for Na: 23 + 25 =48.

Wait, but the question says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes. Hmm, perhaps it's the sum of all isotopes, but that's not feasible as there are many isotopes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to take the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element and sum their masses.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me read the question again.

"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, maybe it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses, taking into account their isotopes. So for each element, find the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, and then among all elements in X, find the lightest and heaviest elements, and sum their masses.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes of each element in X, and then sum those two (lightest and heaviest elements) across X.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, each multiplied by their own isotopic masses. 

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of X as NaH again. Elements Na and H.

For Na: the lightest isotope is Na-23 (mass 23), and heavier isotopes like Na-24 (24), Na-25 (25). So cumulative sum for Na: 23 +24 +25 =72? Or just the lightest and heaviest isotopes? If it's the lightest and heaviest, then sum Na-23 and Na-25: 23 +25 =48.

For H: isotopes are H (1), D (2), T (3). So lightest is 1, heaviest is 3. Sum: 1+3=4.

Now, the lightest element in X is H (mass 1), the heaviest is Na (mass 23). So sum their (lightest and heaviest) elements' masses: 1 +23=24. Not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum includes all isotopes of each element. For Na, all isotopes' masses are summed. Let's say, for example, the main isotopes are 23, 24, 25. Sum would be 23 +24 +25=72. For H, the isotopes are 1,2,3. Sum is 6. Then, the lightest element is H (sum 6), the heaviest is Na (sum 72). So 6 +72=78, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this isn't working. Let me think of another approach. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. These are all odd numbers, which suggests that the sum involves elements with odd atomic numbers, but not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. Let's say X is Cl2. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule. Reacting with Y, maybe a base, to produce... Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of X with Y produces a precipitate G. When heated, G produces B, which has a melting point ~277 K. So B is a solid at room temp, but just barely. Let me think of a solid that's solid just above 0°C. Maybe something like H2O ice, but it's a liquid at higher temps. Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. 

Wait, maybe B is a carbonate. NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) has a melting point of about 270°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrated salt. For example, Na2CO3·10H2O (decahydrate) has a melting point of about 26.5°C. But 277 K is about 4°C. That's lower than 26.5, so the decahydrate would melt. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think of a salt that solidifies around 4°C. Maybe a different hydrate. For example, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate has a melting point of about 24°C. Still higher than 4°C.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different chemical. Wait, maybe B is a different kind of salt. Or perhaps I'm getting stuck on this and need to proceed to another part.

Let me try to think of X as NaOH again. Elements Na, O, H. Cumulative atomic masses considering isotopes:

For Na: isotopes are 23, 24, 25. So the lightest is 23, the heaviest is 25. Sum for Na: 23 +25 =48.

For O: isotopes are 16, 17, 18. Sum: 16 +18 =34.

For H: isotopes are 1,2,3. Sum: 1 +3=4.

Now, the lightest element is H (sum 4), heaviest is O (sum 34). So sum is 4 +34=38. Not an option.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Let me think of elements whose atomic masses add up to these numbers.

Option B is 25. Let's see: 12 (C) +13 (Al?) No. Wait, 12 (C) +13 (Al is 27, no). Hmm. Alternatively, 15 (P) and 10 (Ne? No). Alternatively, 25 = 12 (C) +13 (Al) → no. Wait, 25 = 24 (Mg) +1 (H). So Mg and H. If X contains Mg and H, like MgH2, then the lightest element is H (1), the heaviest is Mg (24). Sum is 1+24=25, which is option B.

So if X is MgH2, then the elements are Mg and H. So the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (H) and heaviest (Mg) would be 1 +24 =25, which is option B.

But does this fit the reaction scenario? Let's think: MgH2 is a strong base. When it reacts with a keto acid, it would form the carboxylate salt, releasing H2. For example, MgH2 + CH3COOH → Mg(CH3COO)2 + H2↑. The product, Mg(CH3COO)2, has two O atoms in the acetate group. So that fits the second condition.

Now, the reaction with Y. MgH2 reacts with Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. Let me think, MgH2 is not very soluble in water, but perhaps Y is a salt solution. For example, if Y is AlCl3, then MgH2 might not react. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate solution. Let me think: MgH2 + Na2CO3 → ? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps MgH2 reacts with an acid to produce H2 gas. So Y could be H2SO4, but then no precipitate would form. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate. MgH2 is a strong base; perhaps it reacts with a nitrate to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is AgNO3, MgH2 might not react. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfate. MgH2 and CuSO4 might react, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is a solution of a metal carbonate or sulfate that reacts with MgH2 to form a precipitate.

Wait, another angle: when MgH2 reacts with Y, what could produce a gas? If Y is an acid, it would produce H2 gas. So W is H2. Let's check if H2's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. H2 has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons=2, total neutrons=0. Not equal. So W can't be H2.

But earlier, I thought CO2 could be W, but if X is MgH2 and Y is a carbonate, then CO2 would be released. So W is CO2, which has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that fits. 

So, if MgH2 reacts with Na2CO3, the reaction would be MgH2 + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + Na2H2O + H2↑? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is MgH2 + Na2CO3 → MgCO3 + 2 NaH. But I'm not certain about the products. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces MgCO3 precipitate and some other products. 

When MgCO3 is heated, it decomposes into MgO and CO2. So B would be MgO. What's the melting point of MgO? It's about 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to gather what I know so far:

- X is a base, possibly NaOH or MgH2.
- Reacts with Y to produce CO2 gas and precipitate G.
- G upon heating releases B with melting point ~277 K.
- The product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms.
- X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. NaOH and KOH are common reagents.

Another thought: perhaps X is a hydroxide of a group 1 metal, like NaOH, KF, etc. Let's think of X as NaOH. Then elements are Na, O, H.

Cumulative atomic masses considering isotopes:

Na has isotopes 23,24,25. Sum for Na: 23 +24 +25 =72.

O has isotopes 16,17,18. Sum: 16+17+18=51.

H has isotopes 1,2,3. Sum:6.

So the lightest element is H (sum 6), heaviest is Na (sum 72). 6 +72=78, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic numbers, not masses. But that doesn't fit the question's wording.

Wait, the question says "cumulative atomic masses", so it's about mass, not atomic number.

Let me think again: X is a base used in organic chemistry. Perhaps X is LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), but that's more of a strong base, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K. So about 4°C. What solid is just starting to melt at 4°C? Maybe a specific hydrate. For example, perhaps B is a hydrate that melts just above 0°C.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps B is a type of ice or a specific crystalline form. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different substance entirely. Maybe it's a carbonate, but I can't think of one that's solid at 277 K.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a solid with a low melting point, like paraffin wax. But paraffin isn't related to the reaction scenario.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. Earlier, I thought 25 could be Mg and H. So option B is 25. Alternatively, if X is something else, like K and O, but K is 39 and O is 16. Sum is 55, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule like O2. But that doesn't fit the other conditions. 

Wait, perhaps the cumulative atomic masses refer to the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements present, considering all isotopes. For example, if X contains H and O. H's lightest isotope is 1, heaviest is 3. O's lightest is 16, heaviest is 18. So sum is (1+3) + (16+18) =4 +34=38. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X contains C and O. C's isotopes are 12,13,14. Sum is 12+13+14=39. O's sum is 16+17+18=51. So sum is 39 +51=90. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then elements are Na, C, O. So lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 12 +23=35, which is option A. But wait, earlier I thought that the product of X and a keto acid would have more oxygen. Let me check.

If X is Na2CO3, then reacting with acetic acid would produce sodium acetate, carbon dioxide, and water. The product (sodium acetate) has two O atoms. So that fits the condition. 

So, if X is Na2CO3, elements present are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35. So option A is 35.

But earlier, the reaction of Na2CO3 with Y would produce CO2 and a precipitate. If Y is an acid, like HCl, then it would produce NaCl and water. No precipitate. But if Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with Na2CO3 to form a precipitate, like CaCl2, then Na2CO3 + CaCl2 → CaCO3 precipitate and 2 NaCl. So G would be CaCO3. Heating CaCO3 would produce CO2 and CaO. CaO has a high melting point. So that doesn't fit. 

But according to this, if X is Na2CO3, the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements is 12 (C) +23 (Na)=35, which is option A. 

But earlier, the product with a keto acid would have two O atoms. Sodium acetate has two O in the acetate group, so that fits. 

So, based on this, the answer would be A)35. 

But wait, the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Na2CO3 has Na, C, O. Carbon has isotopes (like C-13, C-14), but the common isotope is C-12. So perhaps one of the elements has a heavier isotope. For example, Na2CO3 could have a heavier isotope of Na, like Na-25. So X incorporates a heavier isotope, as stated. 

So, considering all this, the answer would be option A)35.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, considering isotopes, and determining which option (25, 29, 31, 35) matches. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reactions and Properties of X**:  
   - Substance X reacts with liquid Y to release gas W, which has equal numbers of protons and neutrons in its molecule. CO₂ is identified as a likely candidate for W, as it satisfies this condition (22 protons and 22 neutrons).  
   - A precipitate G forms during the reaction, which releases B upon heating. B has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C), indicating it is a solid near this temperature.  

2. **Reaction with a Keto Acid**:  
   - When X reacts with a keto acid, the product contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X is a base that neutralizes the keto acid to form a carboxylate salt, such as sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which contains two oxygen atoms in the acetate group.

3. **Isotopic Considerations**:  
   - X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. For example, if X is Na₂CO₃, sodium (Na) has isotopes like Na-23, Na-24, and Na-25, with Na-25 being the heavier isotope.  
   - The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be calculated, considering all isotopes.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (35)**: If X is Na₂CO₃, the elements present are Na, C, and O. The lightest element is carbon (C, atomic mass ~12), and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23). Their cumulative atomic masses sum to 12 + 23 = 35, matching this option.  
   - **Option B (25)**: This would require elements like Mg and H, but X being MgH₂ does not align with the reaction conditions or the formation of CO₂ gas.  
   - **Option C (31)** and **Option D (29)**: These sums do not align with the elements present in plausible candidates for X, such as Na₂CO₃ or MgH₂.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   - Based on the reaction conditions, isotopic considerations, and the cumulative atomic masses, the most consistent answer is **35**, corresponding to X being Na₂CO₃, where the lightest element is C and the heaviest is Na.

**Answer: A**
