Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a small peptidic compound was synthesized, and the 1H NMR spectrum has some issues. The main point is that there are two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So, the integral is correct, but why are there two peaks?

The first thought is about coupling. They mentioned that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. That makes me think it's not something like a doublet of doublets or an AB system because that would usually involve splitting due to neighboring protons. But wait, the same alpha-proton having two peaks. Hmm.

Then, looking at the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. Same mass, but different in what way? Because if it was a different mass, maybe it's a fragment or a byproduct. But here, the mass is consistent, so perhaps it's not a different compound. So, same molecular formula, same mass.

But what makes two peaks? Maybe it's due to isomerism. Enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers would have the same mass, but would they elute at different times in LC-MS? Well, if the LC is a chiral column, then enantiomers would separate. But if it's a regular column, they might not. But in the question, the LC-MS shows two peaks at elevated temperature. Wait, temperature affects retention times, but more importantly, maybe the mobile phase is such that in some cases, the compounds might not be completely separated. Alternatively, maybe the two are not enantiomers but diastereomers, which would have different physical properties and thus elute at different times.

So, diastereomers would have different physical properties, so they would show up as separate peaks in LC-MS. But why the NMR shows two alpha protons? Because if the diastereomers have different configurations, maybe around a stereocenter, the alpha protons might be in slightly different environments, causing differing chemical shifts. Wait, but the shifts are similar. Same alpha-proton, so perhaps it's about a diastereomeric mixture where the proton
