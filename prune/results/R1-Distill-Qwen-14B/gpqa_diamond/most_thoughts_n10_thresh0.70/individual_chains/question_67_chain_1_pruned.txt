Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. Hmm, I remember that electrons have angular momentum, which includes spin and orbital parts. But the question says to ignore spin, so we're only dealing with the orbital angular momentum here.

The problem gives a state represented as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Oh right, each l1 and l2 is the orbital quantum number for each electron. Since they're in p orbitals, l must be 1 for each. So l1 = 1, l2 = 1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. 

Wait, when combining two angular momenta, l1 and l2, the total l can be l1 + l2, l1 + l2 -1, ..., down to |l1 - l2|. Since both are l=1, the possible total l's are 0, 1, 2. So, in this state, the total l is 2, which is the maximum.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We're to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Wait, the eigenvalues for Lz are mħ. So for each electron, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. Because l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So when we measure L1z and L2z, each can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this is a coupled state, where the total angular momentum is specified. To find the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ, we need to find the expansion of this state in terms of the product states |l1, m1> |l2, m2>, right?

But wait, the coupled state is expressed as a combination of product states. So maybe we should look for the coefficients of states where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because if each electron has m=-1, then the total m would be m1 +
