Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes some reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar and doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they yield a single hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is a solvent. Importantly, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably saturated. Also, mixture X has no conjugated multiple bonds.

Hmm. So, the steps are: X → Y via some reaction (disproportionation?), then X and Y hydrogenated to Z.

Let me break down what each part implies.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Substances that do that usually have double or triple bonds. Common examples are alkenes, alkynes, maybe some aromatic compounds. But since there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X, maybe they're simple alkenes or something else without conjugation.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, there's a disproportionation reaction producing Y. Disproportionation usually involves a single substance being both oxidized and reduced. But wait, the question says X is a mixture, so perhaps each component undergoes a reaction. Or maybe each component in X has multiple bonds that are being hydrogenated in some way, but the result is a mixture where each product is a different substance.

Wait, no, the reaction is a disproportionation. So X must be a single substance that can disproportionate into two. But no, the question says X is a mixture of two liquids. Hmm, maybe each component of X undergoes a disproportionation reaction. Or perhaps the mixture as a whole leads to different products.

Alternatively, maybe X is a di- or tri-substituted alkene, but that might not fit. Another thought: maybe X contains alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form alkanes. But wait, the reaction on X produces Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids via disproportionation. Disproportionation suggests that each molecule in X breaks into two, but perhaps more likely, the same substance is split into two different products.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, perhaps each component of X undergoes a different reaction. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the hydrogenation part. When X and Y are hydrogenated, they give only Z. So Z is the product of both X and Y when hydrogenated. That suggests that X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, produce the same product Z. So Z must be an alkane because hydrogenation of alkenes or alkynes gives alkanes.

Wait, but Z is part of Y. So Y must have Z as one of its components, and X, when hydrogenated, would also form Z. So maybe X, when hydrogenated, breaks down into Z, and Y, when hydrogenated, also gives Z. Hmm.

Let me think about Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's calculate that. So if Z is CnH2n+2 (since it's a hydrocarbon and a saturated solvent, likely an alkane), then the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2 * 1) / (12n + 2) ) = 14.28% approx.

Wait, 14.28% is roughly 1/7, since 1/7 is about 14.29%. So maybe the equation is (2n+2)/(12n + 2) = 1/7.

Let me solve that:

Multiply both sides by (12n + 2) *7:

7*(2n +2) = 12n +2

14n +14 =12n +2

2n= -12 → n= -6. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps Z has a different formula. Let me think: if Z is CH3CH2CH2CH3 (butane), its formula is C4H10. So molar mass is 58 g/mol. Hydrogen mass is 10 g/mol. 10/58 ≈ 17.24%, which is higher than 14.28%. Not matching.

What if it's a smaller alkane? Let's try ethane (C2H6). Molar mass 30 g/mol. H is 6 g → 6/30 =20%, nope. Methane? 4/16=25%. No.

What about hexane (C6H14)? H is 14 → 14/(12*6+14) =14/(72+14)=14/86≈16.28%. Still higher.

Wait, maybe it's a different structure. Perhaps it's a cyclohexane? But that's C6H12, which would have H as 12/(72+12) =12/84=14.2857% exactly. Oh! So Z is cyclohexane.

So molecular formula is C6H12. But wait, cyclohexane is C6H12? No, wait. Cyclohexane is C6H12? No, no, wait. No. Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. Wait, no, wait. No, wait: No, wait. No, cyclohexane is actually C6H12? No. Wait, for a cycloalkane, the formula is CnH2n. So for n=6, it's C6H12. But wait, that's not right. Wait, let me correct that. Because alkanes are CnH2n+2. So for cyclohexane, the formula is C6H12. That's correct because it's a ring structure with 6 carbons and 12 hydrogens. But wait, that
