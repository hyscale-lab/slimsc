Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that muons are like elementary particles, similar to electrons but heavier. But I'm not sure if that matters much here.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay, which equals c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is given as h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. And S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I can write that out as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So, Ay = c * S. Let me compute that. Since c is h/(4π), multiplying each element by that constant.

So Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                 [i, 0]]
Which gives:

Ay = [[0, -(i h)/(4π)],
       [(i h)/(4π), 0]]

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are given, but I need to think through the process.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. So let's set that up.

The matrix Ay - λ I is:

[[-λ, -(i h)/(4π)],
 [(i h)/(4π), -λ]]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero. So the determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ (i * (-i) ) * (h/(4π))^2 ].

Wait, let's compute that term. i * (-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant equation becomes λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait. Let me see:

Because h²/(16 π²) is (h/(4π))². So sqrt of that is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me compute the determinant again.

Determinant is (Ay - λI) = 

Top left: -λ, top right: -(i h)/(4π)
Bottom left: (i h)/(4π), bottom right: -λ

So determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

So determinant is λ² - (i * (-i)) (h/(4π))²

i*(-i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - (1)*(h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ±
