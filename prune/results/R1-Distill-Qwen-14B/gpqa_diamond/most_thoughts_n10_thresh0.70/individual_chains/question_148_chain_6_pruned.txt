Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and their reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me list out the information given:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the degree of fluorination or maybe oxygen-free fluorine percentage?) for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, wait, the question says ɷF=31,96% — maybe that's the molar percentage of fluorine in A2?

2. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Hmm, fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but in which compounds?

3. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So Y reacts with F2 to form A3.

4. By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

The goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me try to figure out what each A is.

Starting with A1: It's bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2. The decomposition reaction at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C). Since it's a binary compound of F and Y, and it's red, my mind goes to something like FeF3 or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is YF3? But wait, the decomposition product is A2 with 31.96% F. Let me calculate that.

Assume A2 has a molar ratio of F as 31.96%. Let me think: if A2 is YF3, then the molar mass of fluorine would be 3 * 19 = 57 g/mol. Suppose Y has a molar mass of M, then the total molar mass is M + 57. The F% would be (57)/(M +57) *100 =31.96%. Let's solve for M.

31.96 = (57)/(M+57) *100 → (M+57) = 57 / (0.3196) → 57 / 0.3196 ≈178. So M+57 ≈178 → M≈121. So Y would have a molar mass around 121. But I'm not sure about that yet.

Alternatively, maybe A2 is YF. Let's see, that would be 19/(M+19) = 0.3196 → M+19=19/0.3196 ≈60 → M≈41, but 41 is about the atomic weight of Ga? Not sure, but maybe that's possible. Hmm, but perhaps I should think of other possibilities.

Wait, another angle: A1 is a strong oxidizer, oxidizing xenon. Xenon is in group 0, so it's usually unreactive, but under strong oxidizing conditions, maybe it can form XeF2 or XeF6. But wait, A1 is a binary compound of F and Y, so perhaps Y is a metal that forms a high oxidation state fluoride.

Wait, perhaps Y is iron. I remember that FeF3 is a thing, but wait, maybe it's FeF4? No, wait, iron(III) fluoride is FeF3. Alternatively, maybe Y is iodine? No, because iodine is a halogen.

Wait, another thought: when fluorine reacts with metals, it usually forms MF2 or higher. For example, NaF, MgF2, AlF3, etc. So maybe Y is in the +3 oxidation state. So A1 could be YF3, which decomposes into YF and F2, perhaps?

Wait, but if A1 is YF3, and it decomposes into YF and F2, that would be:

YF3 → YF + F2

But what's the molar percentage of F in YF? Let's see. Molar mass of YF is M + 19. The F percentage is 19/(M+19) *100 =31.96%. So 19/(M+19) =0.3196 → M+19 =19/0.3196 ≈59.46 → M≈59.46-19=40.46. So Y would be about 40.46 g/mol. Looking at the periodic table, that's around Ga (gallium is about 69.72), so that's not matching. Wait, but maybe Y is something else.

Wait, another approach: what if Y is iodine? No, because fluorine is halogen, and I don't think they form binary compounds beyond perhaps I2F5 or something. Wait, but maybe Y is oxygen? No, because O is a chalcogen, and not a metal.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let's think about the decomposition. Suppose A1 is YF3, which
