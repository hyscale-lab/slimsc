Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the non-relativistic case, it's F = -kx, right? But this question is relativistic, so I guess some things change because of relativity.

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. Let's see, the options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. The options involve terms like k, A, m, and c, the speed of light. So, the maximum speed probably occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but in a relativistic context, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA² because at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Since energy is conserved, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², so v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest energy. So, the total energy E is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is also the sum of kinetic and potential. But I think in the relativistic case, the potential energy might be different too. Oh wait, the problem states it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², similar to the non-relativistic case. But when the mass is moving, the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, so the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But in this case, the potential energy at maximum displacement (x=A) is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is the rest of the energy. But the total energy E should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, no. In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy E is conserved. In the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma-1)mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0 (the equilibrium point), all the energy is kinetic. So E = K + U, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy and U is potential. But wait, when x is maximum (x=A), the potential energy is maximum and kinetic is zero, so E = (1/2)kA². At x=0, all that energy is kinetic.

So, E = K = (gamma - 1) mc². Because relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So, (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA². Let me write that equation: 

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me solve for v. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, say, alpha for simplicity. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha) 

Then square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2. Let's compute 1/(1 + alpha)^2:

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 * 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ?

Wait, wait, perhaps expand 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute v²/c² as [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2].

Let me compute that:

1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Expanding (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha². Subtract 1, gives 2 alpha + alpha².

So numerator: 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute back:

v²/c² = [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )²

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Let me factor out the (k A²)/(2 m c²) term.

Let me write alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2

= c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Hmm. Let me see if I can simplify this expression.

Let me factor numerator: 2 alpha + alpha² = alpha (alpha + 2).

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Let me see if I can take the square root to get v.

But perhaps it's better to express this in terms of gamma and then find v.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about energy again.

E = (1/2) k A^2 = (gamma - 1) m c^2.

So, (gamma - 1) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)

Let me denote beta = v/c. Then, 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Squaring both sides:

1 - beta^2 = 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2

So,

beta^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2

Hmm. Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 = [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2

= [ 1 + 2x + x² - 1 ] / (1 +x)^2

= (2x + x²) / (1 +x)^2

= x (2 + x) / (1 +x)^2

So,

beta^2 = [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x)^2

Substituting x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )= alpha,

beta^2 = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha )^2

So,

beta = sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to express v in terms of the given options.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, when the system is at maximum amplitude, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy E is (1/2)kA². So, when the oscillator is at the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so E = K = (gamma -1) m c².

So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma -1) m c²

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) 

Which is what I had earlier.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = 1 + x, where x = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + x

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

So,

sqrt(1 - beta^2 ) = 1/(1 + x )

So,

1 - beta^2 = 1/(1 + x )^2

beta^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2

= [ (1 + x )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x )^2

= (1 + 2x + x² - 1 ) / (1 + x )^2

= (2x + x²) / (1 + x )^2

= x ( 2 + x ) / (1 + x )^2

So,

beta^2 = x (2 + x ) / (1 + x)^2

But x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta = sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 + x )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this form. Let me compute beta as sqrt( [x (2 + x)] ) / (1 + x )

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor this differently.

Wait, maybe expand the numerator and denominator.

Wait, another approach. Let's write the expression as:

beta^2 = [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x )^2

Take x as a small term. But wait, in reality, x could be significant if k A^2 is large compared to m c^2. So, we can't assume it's small.

Wait, perhaps multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + x )^2, but that might not help.

Alternatively, let's consider the expression for v as c times beta.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ x (2 + x) ] ) / (1 + x )

So,

v = c * sqrt( x(2 +x) ) / (1 +x )

Wait, perhaps we can write sqrt( x(2 +x) ) as sqrt( x^2 + 2x )

But not sure if that helps.

Let me look at the options again. Option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, let me compute this:

Option B: 

v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Wait, that would be c * sqrt( [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x) ), where x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, wait, the denominator in the fraction inside the square root is (1 - x), where x = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 + [1/(1 - x)] = [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x) = (2 - x)/(1 - x )

So,

sqrt( (2 -x )/(1 - x ) )

Hmm, that doesn't look like what I have for beta^2.

Wait, wait my calculation. Let me compute:

Inside the square root of option B: 1 + 1/(1 - x )

= [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x )

= (2 - x) / (1 - x )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 - x) )

But from earlier, beta^2 = [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x )^2

Wait, that's different. Hmm. So perhaps option B isn't the right one.

Looking at option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m )) )

Wait, the denominator has (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)), but I think in our calculation, the denominator in x is 2 m c^2, not 2 m. So option A's denominator is missing c^2, so probably incorrect.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's compute the inside of the square root:

1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ]

Which is exactly the expression for beta^2.

Because beta^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ]

So, beta = sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 +x )^2 ] )

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - [ 1/(1 +x )^2 ] )

Which is exactly option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought option D is v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, yes, that's correct. So, beta = sqrt(1 - [ 1/(1 + x )^2 ] )

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 +x )^2 ] )

Which is option D.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought option D was written as 1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2, which matches.

Wait, let me recheck:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have for v.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but wait—earlier when I tried to compute, I found beta^2 = [ x (2 +x) ] / (1 +x )^2, which was different. But now I'm seeing that option D's expression is 1 - [1/(1 +x )^2 ], which equals beta^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, beta^2 = 1 - [1/(1 +x )^2 ]

Which can be rewritten as:

beta^2 = [ (1 +x )^2 -1 ]/(1 +x )^2

= (1 + 2x + x² -1 ) / (1 +x )^2

= (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2

Which is same as [x (2 +x)]/(1 +x )^2.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, v is c times sqrt( beta^2 ), which is option D.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the non-relativistic case, option C is sqrt(kA^2/m). How does that compare to option D when velocities are low (x is small)?

Let me take the limit as x approaches 0.

Option D: v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 )

For small x, 1/(1+x )^2 ≈ 1 - 2x + 3x² - ... So,

1 - 1/(1+x )^2 ≈ 1 - [1 - 2x + 3x² ] = 2x -3 x²

So,

v ≈ c sqrt(2x - 3x^2 )

But x is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v ≈ c sqrt( 2 * (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= c sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( k A²/(m c^2 ) )

= sqrt( (k A² c² )/(m c^2 ) )

= sqrt( k A² / m )

Which is option C.

So in the non-relativistic limit (x is small), option D reduces to option C, which is correct. So, this suggests that option D is the correct expression.

So, the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system's energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and is the sum of its potential energy and kinetic energy. At maximum amplitude (\( x = A \)), all the energy is potential, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, which in the relativistic case is \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at both points:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x}
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the form of option D. To confirm, we check the non-relativistic limit (\( x \to 0 \)):

\[
v_{\text{max}} \approx c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 - \frac{2}{1 + x}\right)} \approx c \sqrt{2x} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}}
\]

This reduces to option C, confirming consistency. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
