Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by going through the information given and try to understand what's happening here.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in the numbers: C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Wait, no, wait, the formula is C8H9NO, so X is zero because there's no halogen mentioned. So the formula becomes (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I think I messed up the formula. Let me recalculate. The formula is C8H9NO. So, I think the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So, substituting: 2*8=16 +2=18. Then subtract H (9), X is 0, but add N which is 1. So 18 -9 +1=10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's a lot. Five could mean, perhaps, a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees, since it's three double bonds) plus maybe a double bond and a ring or another double bond. Or maybe a benzene ring plus a carbonyl group plus something else. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and an ester or something. Let's see the NMR data.

The NMR data is as follows: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me try to interpret this.

The first peak is at 9.72, a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high ppm value, around 9.7, which usually indicates an aldehyde proton. But
