Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to break it down. I'll read through the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances A1 to A5 are all compounds involving Y and fluorine, I guess.

Let me look at the clues one by one.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is 20°C, room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, so A1 is a strong oxidizing agent because it can oxidize xenon, which is a noble gas and quite unreactive.

So, what compounds of fluorine are red and decompose? I remember that in chemistry, fluorine compounds can be colorful. For example, fluorine gas is a pale yellow. Fluorine compounds like AgF or some metal fluorides can have different colors. Wait, maybe this is about the halogens? Or perhaps it's a transition metal fluoride?

Wait, another thought: I remember that potassium chlorate is a strong oxidizing agent, but that's not a fluoride. Oh wait, maybe this is about fluorine itself or fluorine compounds acting as oxidizers.

Wait, fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. So A1 might be a fluorine compound that is a strong oxidizer. When it decomposes, it produces F2 and another compound.

Wait, another angle: perhaps A1 is a diatomic molecule. Let me think about fluorine-related compounds. Fluorine (F2) is a diatomic molecule, but that's
