Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to the distance to a star. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the inverse of parallax: d = 1/plx. So higher parallax means closer stars, and lower parallax means they're farther away.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, so their actual density in space is the same everywhere. But when we observe them, the distribution in terms of parallax isn't uniform because of the distance factor.

I think I need to figure out how the number of stars in a certain parallax range depends on their distances. Let's say I consider a small range of parallax, delta_plx. I want to find how many stars fall into that range.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume around a star at distance d should be proportional to the volume. The volume in a spherical shell (like a thin layer) would be 4π r² dr. But wait, distance is related to parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Oh, wait, plx is in arcseconds, and since d is in parsecs, I think the units will work out.

So, for a given parallax plx, the distance is 1/plx. A small change in parallax, delta_plx, would correspond to a change in distance. Let me think: if I have a parallax plx, and I change it by delta_plx, the distance changes from d to d + delta_d. But since d = 1/plx, delta_d would be approximately -d² delta_plx. Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully.

The number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV, where n is the number density (number per unit volume) which is constant. So, dN = n dV.

Now, dV for a thin shell at radius d is 4π d² dd, where dd is the change in distance. But I need to relate this to a change in parallax, delta_plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx,
