Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i,4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-component. Wait, but wait—so σ_y is the matrix given, right? The matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh right, and ψ is the spin state vector.

Wait, the spin state given is (3i,4). So that's a two-component vector. Let me write that out. The state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ has components ψ₁ = 3i and ψ₂ =4.

The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by σ_y, and then multiplied by ψ. So that would be <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ. But wait, S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, because spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So I'll need to compute ψ† σ_y ψ, multiply by ħ/2, and that's the expectation value.

Wait, let's break it down step by step. First, compute the matrix product σ_y multiplied by ψ, then take the conjugate transpose of ψ and multiply by that result.

So σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]], and ψ is [3i,4]^T. So first, compute σ_y * ψ.

Let's compute each component of the resulting vector. The first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i. The second component is (
