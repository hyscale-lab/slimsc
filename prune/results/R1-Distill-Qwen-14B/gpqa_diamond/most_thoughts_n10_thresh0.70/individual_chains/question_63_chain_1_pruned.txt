Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled with the rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state would be the one with the next higher energy, I guess. But wait, in quantum systems, sometimes the states are quantized. For rotation-vibration models, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions.

Oh right, the energy levels for such a molecule are given by a combination of rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably j=0). But in diatomic molecules, the ground state for rotation is j=0, but wait, wait, no. For rigid rotors, the rotational states are quantized with j starting at 0,1,2,... For a diatomic molecule, which is a rigid rotor, the ground state is j=0. But wait, the question is about the non-rigid rotor model, which I think allows the bond length to change, hence vibration comes into play.

Wait, but the question combines rotation and vibration. So the molecule's total energy is a combination of both. The energy levels would have terms for both rotational and vibrational energies.

So when the problem says the molecule is in the
