Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, and it's in its fundamental state. They want to know the momentum of the photon needed for it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of atoms X and Y, the bond length R, and the angular frequency w.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy vibrational state, right? So the molecule is in its ground state for both rotation and vibration. When it absorbs a photon, it must transition to a higher energy state. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. I'm a bit confusedâ€”does that mean the next vibrational state or maybe a rotational state? Or perhaps a combination?

In the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state would be the lowest possible vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). But wait, I think for rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is a bit different but maybe similar in this aspect.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model allows for bond length fluctuations, which complicates things. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the main thing is to
