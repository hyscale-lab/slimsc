Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps here, each transforming the compound into the next. Also, there are some hints provided, which I need to use to figure out the structures.

First, let's break down the reaction steps.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with a phosphorous ylide (I think that's a Wittig reagent?), forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR spectra: compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Let me think about each part.

Starting with the IR data. A peak around 1750 cm^-1 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. But since the second peak is at 1715, which is slightly lower, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an ester or something else. But ketones are around 1700-1750 usually. So if A has a peak higher than E, that suggests that A might have a more electron-withdrawing group than E. Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Let me think more.

Looking at the first reaction: A â†’ B with HCN. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl, like a ketone, then HCN would add to it, forming a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin. Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, that should reduce the nitrile group in B to an amine. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the H2/Pd could be used for hydrogenolysis, but I'm not exactly sure. Or maybe the hydrogenation is for reducing a triple bond if there's one.

Wait, let me think again. If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN (in a nucleophilic addition) gives a cyanohydrin. So the structure would be a cyclo something with a CH2CN group attached. Then, when B is hydrogenated, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. What's the product of nitrile hydrogenation? I think it typically forms an amine, but under hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, perhaps it becomes an amine, but wait, more accurately, nitriles upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni or Pt might reduce to amines. Wait, but wait, in the presence of H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile is reduced to a primary amine. So if B is a cyanohydrin (so has an alcohol and a nitrile group?), wait no, a cyanohydrin is an addition product where HCN adds to a carbonyl, so the structure would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: when HCN adds to a ketone (like cyclohexanone), it forms a cyanohydrin, which has an -OH group and a -CN group attached to the same carbon. So the structure would have two substituents on a single carbon adjacent to the ring.

So, compound B would be a cyanohydrin. Then, when compound B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So what happens? The nitrile group (CN) would be hydrogenated. Nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically reduce to amines. Wait, no, wait. Another thought: maybe under H2 and Pd, the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of a triple bond if B has one. Hmm, but B is a cyanohydrin, so no triple bonds. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is of the alcohol group? No, because alcohol groups don't typically react under H2 and Pd unless it's a catalyst for something else, like oxidation or elimination.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The reaction is H2 and Pd as catalyst. So, if B is a cyanohydrin, after hydrogenation, maybe the CN
