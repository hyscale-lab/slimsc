Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think through it as best as I can.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. My goal is to identify what E is based on the reaction steps and the given hints.

Let me start by listing out the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, all ketones. So E must be some kind of cyclic ketone.

Hmm, let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the reaction A + HCN → B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. Since A's IR has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, that suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone. So A is likely a cyclic ketone. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So B is a cyanohydrin.

Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Cyanohydrins have a structure where a CH(OH)CN is attached. Hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond of the nitrile group? Wait, no, the cyanohydrin is an alcohol and a nitrile. Wait, when you hydrogenate a cyanohydrin, the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to CH2NH2? Or wait, no. Let me think. Hydrogenation of nitriles typically requires more than just H2 and Pd. Maybe in this case, it's a catalytic hydrogenation. HCN adds to carbonyl to form an alcohol and a nitrile. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. 

Wait, for example, if A is cyclopentanone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin—so B would be something like 1-cyclopentyl-2-hydroxynitrile? No, wait, more accurately, the cyanohydrin would have the structure where the ketone O is replaced by OH and CN groups. So the structure would be CH(OH)CN attached to the cyclopentane ring, perhaps as a substituent.

Hydrogenation of B (with H2 and Pd) would reduce the nitrile group. Because Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenolysis. So the nitrile group (CN) would be hydrogenated to CH2NH2? Or wait, maybe the nitrile is converted into an amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but more likely, in hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, the nitrile might be reduced to CH2NH2. But wait, another possibility is that the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's the alcohol part that's getting hydrogenated? No, alcohols don't typically react under Pd-H2 unless it's a more vigorous condition. Wait, maybe I need to rethink this.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a catalytic hydrogenation that reduces both the nitrile and the alcohol. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine. Or maybe the n
