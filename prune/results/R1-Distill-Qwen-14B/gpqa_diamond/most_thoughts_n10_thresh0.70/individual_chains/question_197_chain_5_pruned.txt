Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, right. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester, especially in a reaction called the Stephen reduction or maybe something else... Wait, wait, no. Oh right, when an ester is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it usually leads to the formation of an acid. Because red phosphorus acts as a catalyst in the breakdown of esters, maybe. Or wait, no, more accurately, I think that reaction is the hydrolysis converting an ester to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, another possibility is the cleavage of certain groups. Let me think.

But first, let's focus on identifying Compound X. The IR and NMR data are given. Let's look at the IR spectrum first. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which suggests O-H stretching, maybe in an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 2500-3300. Also, the 1720 cm-1 peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, which could be from an ester (C=O) or a ketone. But 1720 is a bit high for a ketone; more typical for esters or maybe an acid. Wait, wait,
