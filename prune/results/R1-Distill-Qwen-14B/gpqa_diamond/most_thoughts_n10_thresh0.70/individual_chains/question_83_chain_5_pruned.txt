Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything perfectly, but let's think through it step by step.

The problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction. The question gives some specific details, so let me read it again.

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 liters). Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. So I need to calculate two pH values here.

First, I think I'll tackle the equivalence point. Then the 25% titration.

Let me start with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized by the NaOH. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So first, I need to find out how much acetic acid is present initially. Then find out how much NaOH is needed to neutralize it.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. Moles of acetic acid = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH needed will also be 0.001 mol.

The NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration.

Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 liters = 10 cm³.

Wait, but wait, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. But after that, the solution will consist of the sodium acetate (CH3COO^- Na+) dissolved in water. Since it's the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the solution will be basic. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

So the pH at equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

So let me calculate that. First, the total volume after equivalence.

Initially, after mixing acetic acid and water, the volume is 40 cm³. Then, when adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume becomes 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized, which happens at 10 cm³ of NaOH added. So the total solution volume at equivalence is 20 + 20 (diluted) + 10 (NaOH) = 50 cm³.

Wait, no, wait. No
