Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. Hmm. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the concepts here. Let me think. Parallax and distance are inversely related. Right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. That's the basic relationship between parallax and distance.

The question says the number of stars N varies with 1/(plx^5). So N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, I get N ∝ d^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me do the substitution correctly.

If plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx^5) is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars change with distance per unit range. Oh, so maybe it's about the density or the rate of change.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me rephrase. The number of stars N is proportional to
