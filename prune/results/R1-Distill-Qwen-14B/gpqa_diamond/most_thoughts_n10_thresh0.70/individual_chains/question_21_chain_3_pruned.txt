Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm. So, the question has two parts: A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

The compounds given are benzoquinone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and dimethyl fumarate.

First, I need to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton moves from one atom to another, resulting in a change in the position of double bonds. It's similar to keto-enol tautomerism in carbonyl compounds. For tautomerism to occur, the compound must have a hydrogen that can shift, causing the double bonds to shift positions. This usually requires adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems.

So, part A is asking which of the two compounds (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para-benzoquinone and ortho-benzoquinone. But wait, wait, benzoquinone itself is the oxidized form of benzene with two ketone groups. Does benzoquinone show tautomerism? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should think about if the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, but the structure is such that the carbonyls are conjugated. Wait, no, in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are para to each other. So, maybe the ring is such that tautomerism isn't possible because the structure is more rigid. Or wait, another thought: tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen and a shift in double bonds. Benzoquinone is a di-ketone, but the positions are such that maybe the molecule can't shift easily. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-tr
