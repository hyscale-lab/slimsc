Okay, so I've got this question here about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to think through each option carefully.

Let me start by recalling what regularization is. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are like infinities that pop up in calculations which don't make physical sense. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff later, hopefully getting a finite result.

So the question is asking which theory never needs this regularization when dealing with high energies. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I know that string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. It deals with particles as strings vibrating at different frequencies. I've heard that string theories have a sort of "built-in" regularization because the string states have a certain structure. Strings have a minimum size, maybe, or some other property that prevents the infinities from occurring. Or perhaps because they're extended objects, the divergences are handled differently. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require the same kind of regularization as other quantum field theories.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, and I remember that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom. That means at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, and perturbative methods work well. But wait, even with that, when you calculate loop diagrams (like in perturbative expansions), you still get divergences. So you have to regularize QCD calculations. For example, using methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. It's a well-understood theory, and I remember that even though it's a renormalizable theory, you still need regularization when doing loop calculations. Without regularization, the integrals blow up, so you have to introduce a cutoff. Then, through renormalization, you absorb the divergences into counterterms. So QED definitely requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right, this is the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't deal with the same kind of infinities because they don't have the same mathematical structure as quantum field theories. In classical E&M, you don't have loop diagrams or renormalization issues. So in this case, you don't need regularization because you aren't quantizing the fields or dealing with virtual particles and their associated divergences. So classical E&M doesn't require regularization at high energies because it's not a quantum theory.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which theory 'never' requires regularization. So I need to think: when you go to high energies, do any of these theories avoid needing regularization?

For the quantum theories (options B, C, A), they all involve quantum effects which can lead to divergences, so they probably require regularization. But string theory might be an exception because it's a theory that, at high energies, doesn't have the same divergences as traditional quantum field theories. Because strings have a different structure—like a minimum length scale perhaps—so higher energy (shorter wavelength) doesn't lead to the same issues as point particles do.

Wait, but wait again. I'm a bit confused. For example, in superstring theory, do the calculations require regularization? Or does the structure of the theory (like having a fundamental length scale, the Planck length) prevent the divergences from occurring? Because I remember that string theories avoid some of the problems of QFT, like the infinite energy of point particles, by considering extended objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about whether the theory is renormalizable. But wait, the question is about regularization, not renormalization. Regularization is a part of the process to handle divergences before renormalization. So, in QED, you need regularization. In QCD as well. In string theory, perhaps the divergences are naturally handled without needing explicit regularization.

Wait, another approach: which of these theories are not quantum field theories?
