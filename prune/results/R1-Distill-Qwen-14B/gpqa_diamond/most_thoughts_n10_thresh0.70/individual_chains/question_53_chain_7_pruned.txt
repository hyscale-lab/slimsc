Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so I'm thinking something like benzene with two substituents. The options given are four different molecular formulas, all with varying numbers of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens.

The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound must have an ester functional group, which is O-CO-O.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum data: there are six signals. Let's break down what each part could mean.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents would affect the aromatic protons. If it's para-substituted, the two sets of aromatic protons would be equivalent, so maybe two doublets or something similar. Wait, but the substituents could be in positions that cause different splitting. Hmm, maybe it's an ortho, meta, or para substitution. But since it's di-substituted, I'm thinking maybe one substituent is an ester group, and another is something else. Or perhaps both substituents are ester-related?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The aromatic ring is di-substituted, so two substituents attached. Maybe one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR) and another is a methyl group or something else.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So perhaps there's a substituent with a double bond, such as a vinyl group. The NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets (or quartet of doublets) suggests more complex coupling, maybe with two different sets of neighboring protons. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are methyl groups present. Since there are two signals, they might be in different environments. For example, one could be attached directly to an oxygen (like an ester's R-O- group) and another part of the molecule elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are in different substituents.

No signals correspond to –CH2 groups. That suggests there are no methylene groups (CH2) in the structure. So any substituents on the benzene can't have CH2 in them. For example, if a substituent is an ethyl group (CH2CH3), it would show a CH2 signal, but here there are none. So substituents must be either CH3 or attached in a way that doesn't have CH2 groups.

Putting this together, the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with two substituents. One substituent is an ester group (since IR shows ester). The other substituent could be another group, maybe a vinyl group, but wait, the vinyl protons are in the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group attached via some way that doesn't have CH2.

Wait, wait. Let's think about possible structures. An ester group would be something like O-CO-O-R. But in a benzene ring, substituents can't have too much branching without creating CH2 groups. So perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (like O-CO-OCH3), but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alkenyl group, like a propenyl group, which would have vinyl protons.

Wait, the problem says the di-substituted ring has the ester group. So one substituent is an ester. What else? Let's consider the
