Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about electric potential energy, which I remember is a topic we covered in my electromagnetism class. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. Oh, and their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy contributions from motion—though I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has that 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at the same distance from it. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, minimum energy. I'm guessing that refers to the lowest possible potential energy configuration, but wait, in this setup, are the 12 charges free to move except for being fixed at 2 meters from P? Or are they somehow constrained in another way?

Wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So that probably means they're arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. But the system is isolated, so no external fields influence them. But how are the 12 charges arranged around P? Are they free to move as long as they're on that sphere?

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. Oh, right, because the potential energy of a system of charges can be positive or negative, depending on their arrangement. For the minimum energy, which is the most stable state, I think that would correspond to the configuration with the most negative potential energy. Or wait, no—minimum energy might mean the least potential energy, which could be the lowest possible, which in some cases is negative. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether the potential energy is minimized when the system is in the most bound state or something else.

Wait, no, wait. The potential energy between charges is usually negative when the charges are opposite, but here all the charges are the same. Because each is 2e, so all positive if e is positive. So the potential energy between them would be repulsive, so positive. Because the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = (k q1 q
