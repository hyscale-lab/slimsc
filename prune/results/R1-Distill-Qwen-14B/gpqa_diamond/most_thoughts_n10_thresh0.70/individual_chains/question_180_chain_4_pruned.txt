Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read it again.

The problem states: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So, the setup is that there's a central charge at point P, and 12 other charges each at a distance of 2 meters from P. All the charges are 2e. Since the system is isolated, I think that means we're considering the electrostatic potential energy between all the charges.

Wait, but wait. The question asks for the minimum energy. Minimum in what sense? I remember that the potential energy is a scalar quantity and that in systems of point charges, the potential energy is calculated based on the work done to assemble the charges.

So, for a system of point charges, the total electrostatic potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Since each pair contributes, but each pair is counted once, the formula is (1/(4πε₀)) multiplied by the sum over all pairs of (q_i q_j)/r_ij.

But wait, in this case, we have 13 charges. One is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, the setup is that each of the 12 is at radius 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at the center.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Are all the 12 charges identical and fixed at the same distance from P? So, the 12 are each 2 meters away, and the 13th is at the center.

So, each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from the central charge. So, the distance between the central charge and each of the 12 is 2 meters.

Now, the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So, the pairs would be: the central charge with each of the 12, and the potential energies between each of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait. The 12 charges are at the same distance from P, but do they interact with each other as well? Because they are all at 2 meters from P, but if they're arranged on a sphere, then the distance between any two of them is not zero. Wait, but the problem states that the 12 are 'constrained to stay' at 2 m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement around P. Hmm, but that could complicate things because their mutual distances would vary. Wait, but maybe the question is assuming that all the 12 are at the same point, which would make the problem different. But that's probably not the case because if they're all at the same point, they would all be on top of each other, which isn't possible for point charges. So, I think the problem is more likely assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances vary. However, calculating the exact mutual distances between each pair would be complicated. Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed so that the minimum potential energy is achieved when the charges are arranged in a symmetrical way, like on a regular dodecahedron or something. But honestly, I'm not sure, and perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, and not the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. Because including the 12 choose 2 pairs would complicate the calculation, and the problem might be expecting us to ignore that part.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system, so perhaps all interactions must be considered. But I don't see how. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So, perhaps arranging the charges in a way that the potential energy is minimized. But wait, in electrostatics, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible, but in this case, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, perhaps the mutual potential energies can't be changed because their positions are fixed relative to P, but their arrangement among themselves could vary, affecting the total potential energy. However, calculating that is complicated, so maybe the problem is only looking for the potential energy between the 12 and the central charge, and not the 12's interactions with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the central charge and the other 12. But that
