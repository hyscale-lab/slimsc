Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with different powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ (d)^5. Wait, wait, that's because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe it's about the density or the number per unit distance. Oh, right! The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface density times the area of the sphere (4πd²) times dr. But wait, surface density is stars per unit area per unit distance? No, wait, let's think again.

Wait, the overall number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. But the question is about how the number changes per unit distance, like the derivative of N with respect to d.

So I should find dN/dr. Since N = k d^5, the derivative dN/dd is 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. Wait, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r"—so perhaps it's the number density in a shell of radius r, which would be the derivative of N with respect to r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the change per unit r (dN/dr) is 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Looking back at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait a second, I should double-check. The problem states that the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx is in arcseconds, and distance d is in parsecs, so plx = 1/d. So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5. But stars aren't distributed uniformly in space, but in this case the question is about the number varying with parallax as 1/plx^5, which suggests that the number is increasing more with distance. So the number in each shell increases as r^5, but the question is about the number per unit range, which would be the derivative, so r^4. So yes, the answer is C.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \)), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases as \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, which corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). Taking the derivative of \( N = k d^5 \) (where \( k \) is a constant), we find \( \frac{dN}{dd} = 5k d^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
