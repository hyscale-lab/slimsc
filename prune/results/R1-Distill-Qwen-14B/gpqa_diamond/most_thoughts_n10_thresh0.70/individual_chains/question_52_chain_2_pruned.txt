Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant. So the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So the ratio n1/n2 would change.

Wait, no. The question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So normally, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me think about that. Let me denote R = n1/n2. So R is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) / (g1/g2) ). Wait, I might have to get the equation right.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So rearranged, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

So the ratio R is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), all else being equal. So R increases with higher T, if E2 > E1.

The transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or UV. Let me think about what that corresponds to in terms of energy. The energy difference E2 - E1 can be found using E = hc/λ. But maybe I don't need the exact value because it cancels out later.

So when the star's temperature decreases (5500 K instead of 6000 K), the ratio R = n1/n2 should change. Let's compute how R changes with T.

Let’s call R1 as the ratio when T=6000 K, and R2 when T=5500 K. The factor we're looking for is R1/R2.

So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) )

Wait, no, because when you divide, it's (ΔE/(k T1)) - (ΔE/(k T2)) ) which is ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, let me see:

R1 = exp(ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp(ΔE/(k T2) )
So R1/R2 = exp(
