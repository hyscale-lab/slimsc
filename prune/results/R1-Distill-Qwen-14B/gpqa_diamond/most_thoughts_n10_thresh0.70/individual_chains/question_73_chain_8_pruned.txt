Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says we have two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, because at high speeds, you can't just use the classical velocity addition formula. Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. I remember it's something like (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, which one is v1 and which is v2? Oh, because both are moving in the same direction. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c². Oh, so 1 - 0.3 is 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c when rounded. Looking at the options, that's either C or D for the relative speed.

Wait, but I'm not done yet. The second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. So for each astronaut, their total energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc squared. But wait, their masses are 2m and 3m, so let me compute each of their energies.

For the first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v² is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36c². So 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. Gamma is
