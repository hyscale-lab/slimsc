Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down what each component looks like. 

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Py is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Pz is (ħ/2) times:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

Oh right, the operator P for an arbitrary direction n is given by the vector product of the Pauli matrices and the direction vector. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But in this case, the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, which means n_y is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), right?

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P would then be n_x (Px) + n_z (Pz), since the Py term is zero here.

So to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, I'll set up the eigenvalue equation: P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write out the matrix for P. Since n is (n_x, 0, n_z), P becomes:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So combining these, P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but when I write eigenvalue equations, I can ignore the ħ/2 scaling because it's a common factor. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should factor
