Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states with definite values. So, the operator in question here is the Pauli spin matrix, right? Because the given matrices look like the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and each is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Oh, but wait, in the question, each P component is (ħ/2) times these matrices. So, P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, similarly for P_y and P_z.

The operator given is for spin, so the eigenvectors would be the spin-up or spin-down states along a particular direction. Since the problem is about an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, I think the direction has a certain polar angle θ but zero azimuthal angle φ because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, the arbitrary direction could have any φ but here it's in x-z, so φ is either 0 or π. Hmm, wait, in x-z plane, the direction's azimuthal angle φ is 0 or π, because x is at φ=0 and z is along φ=π/2? Wait, no, wait. The x-z plane is the plane where y=0, so the directions in x-z plane have φ=0 or φ=π. So, the direction vector n is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) but since φ is 0 or π, because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, actually, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0, so any direction in the x-z plane would have φ = 0 or π, right? Because in spherical coordinates, φ is the angle around the z-axis. So for x-z plane, φ is 0 (along x) or π (along -x), or maybe other angles if the direction is a combination of x and z, but wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, any point in the x-z plane will have y=0, so the direction vector can be written as (x, 0, z). So, the spherical coordinates would have θ as the angle from the z-axis, and φ being the angle in the x-y plane, but since y=0, φ is either 0 or π. Wait, no, actually, for points in x
