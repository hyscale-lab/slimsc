Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay processes. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The question is about comparing two decay processes. The first decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The second variant changes things by emitting one exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V particles. So the second reaction would be 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, the problem states that in the first decay, the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with some maximum endpoint Q. I remember that in beta decay, for example, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves conservation of energy and momentum, and the emitted particles (like beta particles) can't take all the energy. So the maximum occurs when the other particles take the least possible energy, like when they are emitted in the same direction with minimal kinetic energy.

In the first case, the decay emits two E particles and two V particles. Let's say E and V are like beta particles, but maybe V are neutrinos or something else. Wait, but neutrinos are usually emitted in pairs or something like that? Not sure. But the key is that the E particles' spectrum is continuous.

Now, the second decay emits M instead of the two V. So instead of 2V, it's M. Since M is massless, that probably affects the energy distribution.

Wait, in the first case, each E and each V would carry some energy. Since E is much lighter than A, but V is much lighter as well. Wait, the problem says E and V are much lighter than A and B. So E and V are probably leptons, like electrons and neutrinos, but the exact type doesn't matter here. Or maybe V is an antimuon or something.

In the first decay, each E and each V is emitted. So four particles in total: two E and two
