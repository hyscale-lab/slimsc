Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that in quantum mechanics, a density matrix describes the state of a system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but here it's a mixed state because it's an average of two projectors.

Wait, so each term here is a projector. The first term is |0⟩⟨0|, which projects onto the state |0⟩, and the second is |1⟩⟨1|, projecting onto |1⟩. The coefficients are both 1/2, so this is a completely mixed state. I think this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices are represented geometrically. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector r is used to describe the state. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a 3-dimensional vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). For a maximally mixed state, I think the Bloch vector should be at the origin because it's the completely mixed state—no direction in the Bloch sphere.

Wait, let me think again. The maximally mixed state has equal probability for both |0⟩ and |1⟩, and no coherence. So in the Bloch vector terms, the vector would have no components. Because coherence terms are in the off-diagonal elements, and in this case, the density matrix has only diagonal elements. The diagonal elements are 1/2 for |0⟩ and |1⟩.

So the density matrix ρ can be written as:
ρ = [[1/2, 0],
     [0, 1/2]]

Which is the same as the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. So I = [[1,0],[0,1]], so ρ = I/2.

In the Bloch sphere parametrization, the identity matrix corresponds to r = (0,0,0). Because the (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, when r is zero, it's just I/2.

Looking at the options:
Option B is (0,0,1) – which would be along the z-axis. But wait, wait. Wait, the maximally mixed state is at the origin. So the correct r vector is (0,0,0),
