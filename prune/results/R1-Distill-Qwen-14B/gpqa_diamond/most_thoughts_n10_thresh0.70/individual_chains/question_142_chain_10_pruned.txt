Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the options are about where it's located in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

Wait, what's a density matrix look like for a pure state versus a mixed state? Oh right, a pure state has a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and its trace is 1. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, so it's a convex combination of projectors. 

Looking at the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So that's (|0⟩⟨0|)/2 + (|1⟩⟨1|)/2. Each term is a projector, and their coefficients sum to 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So this is a mixed state, a completely mixed state, I think. 

Wait, in a two-level system, like a qubit, the completely mixed state is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So yeah, that's exactly what ρ is. And the completely mixed state corresponds to a classical mixture of the two basis states, which in terms of Bloch vector representation should be at the origin. Because the Bloch sphere represents pure states as points on the sphere's surface, and mixed states as vectors inside. The completely mixed state is the center, so r = (0,0,0). 

So the question is about the geometrical position. The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = [x, y, z], where x = Tr(σ_x ρ), y = Tr(σ_y ρ), z = Tr(σ_z ρ), with σ being the Pauli matrices. 

Let me compute each component. The Pauli matrices are:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The density matrix ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute each term. 

First, compute Tr(σ_x ρ). Let's calculate σ_x multiplied by ρ. Let's write ρ as a matrix. 

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and multiplying by 1/2 makes it [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Now, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σ_x * ρ would be [[ (0)(1/2)+(1)(0), (0)(0)+(1)(1/2) ],
[ (1)(1/2) + (0)(0), (1)(0) + (0)(1/2) ]]

Wait, maybe it's better to compute Tr(σ_x ρ) directly. Alternatively, since Tr(AB) is the same as Tr(BA), and Tr is the sum of diagonal elements.

Alternatively, since ρ is diagonal, σ_x ρ will be [[0*1/2 +1*0, 0*0 +1*(1/2)], [1*(1/2) + 0*0, 1*0 + 0*(1/2)]]? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's compute σ_x * ρ and then take the trace.

σ_x:
0 1
1 0

ρ:
1/2 0
0 1/2
