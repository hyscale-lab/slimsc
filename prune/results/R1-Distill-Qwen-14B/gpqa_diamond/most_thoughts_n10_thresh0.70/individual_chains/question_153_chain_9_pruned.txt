Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about the Michael addition, which I remember involves the reaction of an enolate with an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

The problem has three parts, labeled A, B, and C, each a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each and match them with the given options.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. Hmm, NaOEt is a strong base, so I think it will deprotonate dimethyl malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a strong enolate.

The other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the Michael acceptor. The structure of this would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The E configuration means the higher priority groups are opposite each other.

In a Michael addition, the enolate attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is symmetric, so both ends are the same) would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. The attack would occur at the beta carbon, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

After the attack, the product would have the two groups from the enolate (the methyl groups) attached, and the p-tolyl group from the acrylate. So, the product would be a substituted malonate. Let me think about the structure. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2C(COOCH3)2, but when it adds to the acrylate, the enolate (from the alpha carbon) would attack the beta carbon. So the structure would become something like (CH3)2C(COOCH3) attached to the p-tolyl group.

Wait, more accurately, the product would be a tricarboxylate. Let me draw it out mentally. The enolate (from the malonate) attacks the acrylate's beta position. The acrylate is CH2=CH(COOMe) with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)COOCH3. So the alpha position is the CH2, beta is the C connected to the p-tolyl.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is (CH2(COOCH3)2)âˆ’ ) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the addition would form a new carbon chain connecting the two. So the product would be a tricarboxylate ester. The structure would be (CH3COO)2CH-CH(C6H4Me)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. The enolate would form at the central CH2, making it CH2- with negative charge, which attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=C(C6H4Me)COOCH3. So when the enolate attacks, we get:

(CH3COO)2C-CH2 added to the acrylate's C=C. Wait, maybe it's more like the enolate (from the malonate) attacks the acrylate's beta carbon, so the structure becomes:

(CH3COO)2C-CH2-C(C6H4Me)-COOCH3? No, wait, that can't be right because the positions might be different.

Alternatively,
