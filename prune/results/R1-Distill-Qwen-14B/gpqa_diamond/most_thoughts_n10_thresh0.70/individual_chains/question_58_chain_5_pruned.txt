Okay, so I'm trying to answer this physics question about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite results that pop up in calculations. So the question is asking which of the given theories doesn't need that.

Let's look at the options one by one. 

Option A is Superstring Theory. I'm a bit fuzzy on string theory. I think it's a theory that tries to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity by replacing point particles with strings. Wait, string theory is supposed to be a candidate for quantum gravity. Quantum gravity usually deals with high energy scales, right? But does string theory require regularization? Well, string theory's perturbative calculations often involve things like the string tension and the Regge behavior, but I'm not sure if they do regularization. I think string theories are finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. So maybe they don't need regularization. But I'm not entirely certain.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I remember that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and that it's asymptotically free. At high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling becomes weak, which is why perturbative methods work. But when you go to lower energies, the coupling becomes strong, leading to confinement. Wait, but regularization is often used in QCD calculations, especially for dealing with divergences in loop integrals. So I think QCD does require regularization. So B is probably not the correct answer.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetic interactions. I know that QED is a renormalizable theory. Renormalization is a process that deals with infinities in calculations by absorbing them into physical parameters like mass and charge. But does that mean regularization is needed? Regularization is a step in renormalization. You introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, then take the cutoff to infinity in a controlled way. So QED definitely requires regularization. So C is not the right choice.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories, like Maxwell's equations, don't involve quantum mechanics or the renormalization process. Regularization is a quantum field theory concept because it deals with handling divergences that come from the calculations in QFT. So in classical ED, you don't have these infinities because it's not quantized. So D might be the answer.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. Classical theories might not handle high energies correctly because they don't include quantum effects. For example, at very high energies or small distances, quantum effects become significant. So if you tried to apply classical electrodynamics at high energies, you might run into problems. But the question is whether the theory ever requires regularization. Since regularization is a quantum concept, a classical theory wouldn't need it. So D's theory never requires regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

So putting it all together: the theories that are quantum (A, B, C) probably require regularization except for superstring theory if they don't. But wait, I thought superstring theory is a quantum theory. So why wouldn't it require regularization? Oh, wait, maybe because string theory is background-dependent and has a different approach to dealing with divergences. Alternatively, perhaps string theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences as QFT because of the way it's formulated.

Wait, no, in reality, string theory does deal with things like the string tension and the Regge behavior, which might lead to different types of divergences. But I'm not sure if they require regularization as it's done in QFT. I think string theory's perturbation series doesn't lead to the same type of divergences because the theory is inherently background-dependent and perhaps more naturally finite. Or maybe they use different methods to handle potential divergences without the need for traditional regularization.

Alternatively, I could have this wrong. Maybe all the quantum theories require regularization, except D. Because D is classical, it doesn't have the problem of divergences in calculations, so
