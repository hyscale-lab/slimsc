Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, A and B, each from a different reaction. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH (which is potassium hydride), and then H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. But wait, in this case, after deprotonation, they add H+ again. So, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by some kind of acid workup.

The starting compound is a spiro compound. Spiro means it's connected at a single atom, right? So, spiro[3.5]non... okay, so the structure must have two rings connected at one carbon. The compound is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-) attached at position 1. The structure is something like a spiro system with a double bond at position 5.

When you treat alcohols with a strong base like KH, it deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, under certain conditions, the alkoxide can undergo elimination. But wait, the solvent is THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. After deprotonation, adding H+ would protonate the product, perhaps.

Wait, so maybe this is an elimination reaction. Deprotonation followed by elimination (like E2) to form a double bond. But the starting material already has a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, no, another thought: maybe it's a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction. The spiro structure might undergo some rearrangement. Another possibility is the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, KH is a strong base, but in some cases, it can also act as a source of hydride ions. Oh, wait, no, wait, hydride would be H-; but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group is deprotonated to form an alkoxide, which then undergoes an elimination reaction, maybe a conjugate elimination. Or maybe it's a Claisen type rearrangement? Hmm, but Claisen is usually for allyl vinyl ethers. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that's more for 1,2-diols.

Wait, another possibility: the spiro alcohol, when deprotonated, could form an enolate. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, since the starting material is an enol, perhaps under basic conditions, it undergoes some conjugate addition or elimination.

Wait, another approach
