Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. Hmm, I remember from my studies that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance depends on their lifetime and speed. 

Wait, the problem gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I think the width relates to the lifetime somehow. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. The formula I remember is Γ = ħ / τ, but wait, actually I think it's Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, that's for the lifetime, right? And then the decay distance would be the product of the particle's speed and its lifetime. So lifetime is important, and speed depends on the energy and mass.

Wait, but particles like mesons are moving relativistically, so perhaps I should think about their velocity in terms of their energy. I need to find the velocity, then multiply by the lifetime and the speed of light maybe? Or is it the product of the velocity, c, and the lifetime?

Wait, the mean decay length is L = v * c * τ. Because the particle is moving at velocity v, which is a fraction of the speed of light c. So I need to calculate v, then multiply by c and τ.

But to get v, I need to find the velocity of the meson X. Since E is given, and the mass is known, I can find the kinetic energy, but wait, E is the total energy, I think. So E = gamma * m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). Let me write that down.

E = 8 GeV, which is 8e9 eV. Mass m is 1.2 GeV, so m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 8/1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so I can solve for v. Let me rearrange that:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / gamma.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma².

v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

Let me compute that. Gamma is approximately 6.6667, so gamma squared is around 44.4444.

1/gamma² is around 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775.

v²/c² = 0.9775, so v = c * sqrt(0.9775).

What's sqrt(0.9775)? Hmm, sqrt(0.98) is about 0.9899. Let me approximate. 0.9775 is a bit less than 0.98, so sqrt would be a bit less than 0.9899. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Let me calculate 0.9775^0.5. Let's see, 0.9775 is 0.9775, so when I square 0.988, I get 0.976144. Hmm, 0.988^2= (0.988)(0.988) = let's calculate:

(0.988)^2 = (1 - 0.012)^2 = 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144 = 0.976144, which is a bit less than 0.9775. So 0.988^2 is 0.976144. The target is 0.9775, which is 0.9775-0.976144=0.001356 higher. So each 0.001 increase in the square would require a small increase in the root. Let's try 0.988 + delta. The derivative of x² is 2x, so at x=0.988, the derivative is ~1.976. So delta ≈ (0.001356)/(2*0.988) )= 0.001356 / 1.976 ≈ approx 0.000686. So v ≈ 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686. So v/c ≈ 0.9887. Close to 0.9887c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach, but let's proceed with this approximation. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

Now, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV. So Γ = 320 MeV, which is 320e6 eV. But to compute τ, which has units of seconds, I need to make sure the units are correct. 

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

Let me compute that. 6.582 /0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s. Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 3.2e-1 = (6.582/3.2) * 1e-24. 6.582/3.2 is about 2.056875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ * c? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the particle is moving at velocity v, so distance is v multiplied by time. So L = v * τ. But v is in terms of c, so it's v = β c, so L = β c τ.

So L = β c τ.

Let me plug in the numbers. Beta is 0.9887, c is approximately 3e8 m/s, and τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating the numbers:

0.9887 *3e8 = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = Let's compute 2.966 * 2.056875 first.

2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let me compute 3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625, minus 0.034 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.0699. So approx 6.170625 - 0.0699 = ~6.1007.

So 6.1007e8 * 1e-24 = 6.1007e-16 m.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 2.966e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s.

So 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

So 2.966 * 2.056875. Let's compute:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875 = let's compute 0.966 *2 = 1.932, 0.966 *0.056875≈ approx 0.966 *0.05=0.0483, 0.966*0.006875≈ ~0.00664, so total ≈ 0.0483+0.00664=0.05494. So 1.932 + 0.05494= 1.98694.

So total 4.11375 + 1.98694= ~6.10069.

So 6.10069e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options A and C are around 1e-15 and 5e-16. Wait, 6e-16 is 6.0e-16, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait let's double-check the calculations.

First, let's make sure about the calculation of gamma. Gamma was E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666...

So gamma is 6.666666... Then, 1/(gamma^2) is 1/(44.444444) = approximately 0.0225.

So 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887, as I did earlier. So that part is correct.

Now, calculation of tau. ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s, correct.

Now, let's compute beta and the velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to calculate the lifetime using natural units and then convert to meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, L = v * tau. But v is in terms of c, so L = beta c tau.

So let me compute beta c tau again.

beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s): 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute.

2.966e8 = 2.966 * 1e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24.

2.966 *2.056875 = approximately 6.1007 as before.

So 6.1007 * 1e-16 m.

So 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B)4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, none of these match 6.1e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's reexamine the calculation. Maybe I messed up the formula for the decay length.

Wait, another way: the decay length is c * tau * beta gamma. Wait, no, perhaps I need to consider relativistic effects.

Wait, the lifetime tau is the proper lifetime. The time experienced in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation, which is gamma times tau. Oh wait, no: the proper lifetime is tau. Because gamma is the time dilation factor. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

Wait, so wait, perhaps the lifetime I'm using is the proper lifetime. So the lab frame lifetime is longer, so I should use gamma tau.

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong. Because the decay length is velocity multiplied by the lifetime as seen in the lab frame.

Wait, no, wait. The mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. So yes, the decay length is L = v * t_lab = v * gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me clarify. The natural line width is Γ, and the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Γ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau_0 because of time dilation.

So the lab frame lifetime is tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

Hence, the decay length is L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma tau_0.

So substituting, L = beta c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but tau_0 is ħ / Γ, so:

L = beta c gamma (ħ / Γ).

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it this way.

So let me re-calculate:

beta = 0.9887, gamma =6.66666..., ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s, Γ=0.32 GeV.

So:

L = beta * c * gamma * (ħ / Γ).

So plugging the numbers:

beta = 0.9887,

c = 3e8 m/s,

gamma=6.66666,

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s,

Γ=0.32 GeV.

So:

L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.66666 * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV).

Wait, the GeV units cancel, s cancels with the division by s? Let me make sure.

Breaking it down:

(6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 /0.32) s = approx 2.056875e-24 s, as before.

So then,

L = 0.9887 * 3e8 * 6.66666 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute step by step.

First, compute 0.9887 *3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Then, 6.66666 * 2.056875e-24 s = let's compute:

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23,

0.66666 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-24.

Adding them: 1.234125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.37125e-24 + 1.234125e-23 = 1.37125e-24 + 12.34125e-24 = 13.7125e-24 = 1.37125e-23.

Wait, that's probably incorrect. Let me calculate 6.66666 *2.056875e-24.

6.66666 *2.056875 = let's compute 6*2.056875=12.34125, 0.66666 *2.056875≈ 1.37125. So total 12.34125 +1.37125=13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 = 1.37125e-23.

So now, L = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s).

Multiply 2.9661e8 by 1.37125e-23.

2.9661e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.9661 * 1.37125) * 1e8 *1e-23.

2.9661 *1.37125 ≈ let me compute 3 *1.37125=4.11375, minus 0.0339 *1.37125≈ 0.0466. So approx 4.11375 -0.0466=4.06715.

So 4.06715e-15 m.

Wait, because 1e8 *1e-23 = 1e-15.

So L ≈4.067e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15.

Wait, 4.067e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Hmm, so where did I go wrong earlier? Probably because I forgot that the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So initially, I used the proper lifetime tau_0, but the correct approach is to use tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

Ah, that makes sense. So the corrected calculation gives me L ≈4.067e-15 m, which matches option B.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations:

Alternative approach: L = beta * gamma * c * ( ħ / (Γ) )

Wait, that's another way to write it.

So, beta is v/c, gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So let me compute each part.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.4444)) ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So beta is approx 0.9887.

gamma is 6.666666...

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So putting it all together:

L = beta * gamma * c * ( ħ / Γ )

So:

L = 0.9887 * 6.666666 * 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV )

The GeV cancels, s in numerator and denominator also cancels except for the one in the numerator which then is in the denominator as 1/s, but wait, let's compute units.

Wait, c is m/s, so:

beta (dimensionless) * gamma (dimensionless) * c (m/s) * ( ħ (GeV s) / Γ (GeV) )

So, (GeV s) / GeV = s.

So units: m/s * s → m.

So L has units of meters.

So,

Compute each part:

beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.666666 ≈ 6.666666 *0.9887 ≈ approx 6.6 * 0.9887.

Wait, 6.666666 is approx 6.666666667.

6.66666667 * 0.9887 → calculate 6 *0.9887 = 5.9322, 0.66666667 *0.9887≈ 0.6591. So sum is 5.9322 + 0.6591≈6.5913.

So beta*gamma ≈6.5913.

Then, 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 s / 0.32 ) → wait, let me compute (6.582e-25 /0.32 ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

So now,

3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta*gamma ≈6.5913.

So 6.170625e-16 m *6.5913 ≈ ?

6 *6.170625e-16 = 3.702375e-15.

0.5913 *6.170625e-16 ≈ let's compute 0.5*6.170625e-16 =3.0853e-16; 0.0913*6.170625e-16≈ approx 5.628e-17. So sum is 3.0853e-16 +5.628e-17= 3.6481e-16.

Total ≈3.7024e-15 +3.6481e-16= 4.0672e-15 m.

Which is 4.0672e-15 meters. So about 4.067e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relativistic formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \)),
- \( \Gamma \) is the decay width of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The total energy of the particle is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta = 0.9887 \),
- \( \gamma = 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.5913
\]

Then, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \cdot 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

ANSWER: B
