Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll go through each part carefully.

Alright, let's start with the first part. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, forming a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given, so I need to figure out what product 1 is.

Hmm, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's an elimination reaction. When two bromine atoms are adjacent or vicinal, elimination (like E2) can form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure. So eliminating H2O from two adjacent Brs would form a double bond. Oh, wait, but KOH in such conditions would deprotonate and form an epoxide? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, when vicinal dihalides react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form adamantylene, which is an alkene.

Wait, but then the IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That peak is usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group, then perhaps it's not an elimination to an alkene. Hmm, maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-elimination but forming something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination followed by some rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when dihalides react with strong bases, like KOH, sometimes they can form epoxides if the base is not too strong. Wait, no, epoxides usually come from epoxidation reactions, like with peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene, but the IR doesn't support that because we don't see a peak around 1650 (which would be C=C). But the IR does show 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But with excess KOH, maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, no, substitution would give a diol, but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclic ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoethane) react with KOH, they form an epoxide. Wait, no, that's when you have a peracid. Vicinal dihalides with a strong base like KOH would eliminate to form alkenes. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe instead of elimination, it's a substitution. Let's see: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH... Each Br could be replaced by OH, but that would form a diol. But then, where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, perhaps it's an intramolecular elimination. Let's imagine that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so removing them would lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe it's via an E2 mechanism where two HBr molecules are eliminated, and the two adjacent carbons that lose Br and H form a double bond. But that would produce an alkene, so where does the carbonyl come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound undergoes a dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the IR peak.
