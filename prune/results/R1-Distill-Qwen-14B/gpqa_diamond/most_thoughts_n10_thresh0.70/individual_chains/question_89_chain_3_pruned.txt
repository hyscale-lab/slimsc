Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps to produce a product whose NMR we're analyzing. The options given are about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product.

First, I'll break down each reaction step and see what each product might be.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction (E2 mechanism) to form an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, that's a dihalide where the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two non-adjacent carbons. Hmm, but eliminating two adjacent bromides would require them to be on adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe I'm mistaken.

Wait, no, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then when KOH is added, perhaps it's a double elimination. Oh, wait, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation for each Br. Wait, but maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination. Wait, but if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe the correct product is when the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons? No, because 1,3 would be two apart in a diamondoid structure. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide? No, that's not likely with KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Wait, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a primary carbon? Maybe each Br would undergo an SN2 substitution, but with KOH, perhaps it's a double substitution. But then what would you get?

Wait, wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-diol. Because when Br is replaced by OH, and with excess KOH, maybe each Br is replaced by an -OH group. So the product would be 1,3-adamantanediol. But wait, let me think about the NMR data provided for product 1. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), which is around where OH groups would appear, but wait, if it's -OH, but after substitution, perhaps the protons are in a more deshielded environment. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but that's more with a peracid, not KOH.

Wait, but another possibility: when vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, they eliminate to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, they would not be adjacent, so elimination would not form a double bond. Hmm, maybe the initial product is an ether? No, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a cyclopropane. Wait, but with KOH? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons. Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me try to imagine the adamantane structure. Adamantane has a structure similar to four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1 and 3 could be non-adjacent. So, if each Br is on a different carbon, maybe elimination isn't possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH to produce 1,3-adamantanediol. But let's look at the NMR for product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Wait, if it's a diol, the -OH groups would appear as broad peaks, but in the data, the peaks are at 4.79 (2H). That could be a CH2 group next to oxygen. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but that would have a different NMR pattern.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but for that, you need two adjacent Br atoms. So perhaps I misunderstood the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product
