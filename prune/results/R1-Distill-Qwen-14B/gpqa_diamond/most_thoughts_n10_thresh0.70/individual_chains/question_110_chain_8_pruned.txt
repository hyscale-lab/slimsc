Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So that means anything with a V mag less than or equal to 17 is observable, right? Wait, no, wait—wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag." Oh, right, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if something is brighter than 17, its V magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars down to about V=17, but not brighter than that? Wait, no, wait—no, the wording is a bit tricky. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So that means V <17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So the limit for ESPRESSO is V <=17 mag. Because if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is lower than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe up to 17 mag.

HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if it's brighter than 16, its V is less than 16. So the threshold is 16.

So a star that can be observed by both must have apparent V magnitude <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). Wait, no, because for both, the star's apparent V must be bright enough. So the star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO? Wait, no, ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17. So if a star's V is brighter than 17, that is, V <17, then ESPRESSO can see it. And for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, which would be V <16. So a star that
