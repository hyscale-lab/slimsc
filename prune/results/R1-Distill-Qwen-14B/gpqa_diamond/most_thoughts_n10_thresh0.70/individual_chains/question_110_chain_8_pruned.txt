Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let's start by understanding the question and the given data.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, and HIRES is at Keck. From the problem, I see that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can detect stars up to around 17 mag. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag. So, the stars must have an apparent V magnitude (m) that is <=16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO. But wait, no, wait. The problem says that with ESPRESSO, stars "brighter than 17 V mag" can be observed. Wait, wait, wait. Hmm. Wait, "brighter than" in astronomy usually means lower magnitudes. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its apparent V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, right? Because the scale is inverted.

Wait, let me clarify: in astronomy, the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter objects. So when they say a star with V magnitude brighter than 17 can be observed, that means m_V < 17. Because a star with m_V = 17 is dimmer than one with m=16, for example. So, the ESPRESSO can observe stars where m_V is less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars where m_V is less than 16. So the maximum apparent magnitude that can be observed by ESPRESSO is 17, and by HIRES it's 16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16. Because if it's <=16, then it can be detected by both (since HIRES requires <=16 and ESPRESSO can go up to 17). So the star's apparent magnitude must be <=16.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust) if applicable, because that affects the observed magnitude.

Let's go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude (M) is 15.5 mag, distance is 10 pc. I'll calculate its apparent magnitude using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for Star1: d=10, so log(10/10)= log(1)=0. So m = 15.5 +0 =15.5.

But wait, is there any extinction (E(B-V)) for Star1? The description doesn't mention it. Oh, looking back: Star1's data is given as absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc. No mention of E(B-V), so I assume no extinction. So m=15.5, which is less than 16. So this star can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Because 15.5 is less than 16
