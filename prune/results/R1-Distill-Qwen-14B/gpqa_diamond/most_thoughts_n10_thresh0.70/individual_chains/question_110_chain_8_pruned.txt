Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at the Paranal Observatory and HIRES at the Keck Observatory. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the question gives me some key information about both spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the stars have to be bright enough to be seen by both. Wait, but it's about apparent magnitude, right? Because if a star's apparent magnitude is lower (brighter), then both can see it. But wait, ESPRESSO is more sensitive for fainter stars? Because it can go up to 17, which is fainter than 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude should be ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. Wait no, wait. No, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Similarly, HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag, which is apparent V less than or equal to 16. So the overlapping range is apparent V less than or equal to 16, because both can detect up to their limits. So any star with apparent V ≤16 can be seen by both.

Wait, no. Because for ESPRESSO
