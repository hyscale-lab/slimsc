Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it perfectly balanced the energy it received from its star with its own emitted radiation. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since the albedos are the same for both planets, that part cancels out, I think.

The question gives me data on the star and the two planets. Let me jot down the key points. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff (effective temperature) of 6300 K. Each planet's mass and radius are given too. But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperature, which mainly depends on distance, star's luminosity, and planet's albedo. So the masses and albedos probably don't directly affect the equilibrium temperature, except that albedo is the same, so it's irrelevant here.

Wait, the RV method detects planets through Doppler shifts due to their gravitational pull on the star. The transit method detects them by the drop in brightness as they pass in front. But in this case, the problem gives me specific information about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. For Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. I think this relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The amplitude of this velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula I recall is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M sin i) / ( (P (1 - e²))^(1/3) * (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ), but wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the velocity semi-amplitude. Oh right, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But maybe I don't need to get into that. Alternatively, I remember that the RV velocity is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (a_p)^(1/3) ), but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, another approach: the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is related to the velocity (v) via the formula Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light.

Wait, the problem gives the Doppler shift in terms of wavelength change. So for each planet, we can find the velocity of the star. The formula for Doppler shift is Δλ/λ = v/c. But since the shifts are given as up to 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å, I can compute the velocities.

The forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å. So the fractional shift is 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6. Since v = c * (Δλ/λ), and c is about 3e8 m/s, v ≈ 3e8 m/s * (4.76e-6) ≈ 1428 m/s. Similarly for Planet2: 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.35e-6, so v ≈ 3e8 * 6.35e-6 ≈ 1905 m/s.

Wait, no, wait. That's the velocity amplitude (K) of the star due to the planet. K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is the maximum velocity towards or away from us. So higher K means the star is moving faster due to the planet's gravitational pull.

But how does this relate to the planet's distance from the star? The star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbit. I think the formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since P is the orbital period, and a is the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbits, so a is the radius), we can use Kepler's third law, which says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_p)/(4π²). But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So P² ≈ (4π² a^3)/(G M_star)

Substituting P into the K equation, let's see. Let me write it out.

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M_star)^(2/3) ) )

Substituting P from Kepler's law:

P = [ (4 π² a^3) / (G M_star) ) ]^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = [ (4 π² a^3) / (G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 )

Putting that into K:

K = (2 π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / ( [ (4 π² a^3) / (G M_star) ) ]^(1/6 ) * (M_star)^(2/3) ) )

Let me simplify the denominator exponents. Let's compute each part.

The denominator is [ (4 π² a^3)/(G M_star) ) ]^(1/6) * M_star^(2/3 )

Let me compute the exponents:

First, (4 π² a^3 / (G M_star) )^(1/6 ) = (4 π²)^(1/6) (a^3)^(1/6) (G M_star)^(-1/6) )

So that's (4)^(1/6) (π^(1/3)) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )

Then multiplying by M_star^(2/3), the denominator becomes:

(4^(1/6) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )) ) * M_star^(2/3 )

Combine the M_star exponents: (-1/6 + 2/3 ) = ( -1/6 +4/6 ) = 3/6 = 1/2. So M_star^(1/2 )

Putting it all together, the denominator is 4^(1/6) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2 )

So K becomes:

(2 π G)^(1/3) * M_p / [4^(1/6) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Let me rearrange the terms:

= [ (2 π G)^(1/3) * M_p ] / [ 4^(1/6) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Let me compute the terms in the numerator and denominator.

First, let's compute the constants:

2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) * G^(1/3) vs denominator's 4^(1/6) * π^(1/3)

Wait, 4 is 2^2, so 4^(1/6) is 2^(2/6) = 2^(1/3). So numerator has 2^(1/3) in 2, and denominator has 2^(1/3) from 4^(1/6). So 2^(1/3)/2^(1/3) = 1.

Then, the Pi terms: numerator has π^(1/3), denominator has π^(1/3) → cancel.

G terms: numerator has G^(1/3), denominator has G^(-1/6). So G^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2).

So now, the K simplifies to:

M_p * G^(1/2) / [ a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Wait, wait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let's re-express the constants.

Wait, the numerator is (2 π G)^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) * G^(1/3).

Denominator's constants term is 4^(1/6) * π^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3).

So numerator's 2^(1/3) / denominator's 2^(1/3) = 1.

Similarly, numerator's π^(1/3) / denominator's π^(1/3) =1.

So, the G terms: numerator has G^(1/3), denominator has G^(-1/6). So G^(1/3) / G^(-1/6) = G^(1/3 + 1/6) = G^(1/2).

So after simplifying constants, the K becomes:

[ M_p * G^(1/2) ] / [ a^(1/2) * M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Hmm, so K = M_p * sqrt(G) / [ sqrt(a) * sqrt(M_star) ) ]

Wait, that can be rewritten as K = M_p * sqrt( G/(a M_star) ) )

But let me square both sides to see the relation between K and a. Maybe that's easier.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward relation. I've heard that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(1/3)) ) / (a^(1/3) ), but I'm a bit shaky on this. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For each planet, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(1/3) a_p^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps K is proportional to (M_p) / (a_p^(1/3) ), assuming sin i is about 90 degrees (edge-on orbit, which is optimal for transit, so likely i≈90 degrees). Since transit method requires edge-on orbit, that's a given. So we can approximate sin i ≈ 1.

So K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M_p2 / a2^(1/3) ) )

So K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )

But I need to find a1/a2, the ratio of the orbital distances.

Wait, the question provides the RV shifts for each planet. Since the RV shift is proportional to the velocity K, then the ratio K1/K2 is 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So (3/4) = (7 /5 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

Let me write that as (3/4) = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )

So solving for (a2/a1):

(3/4) / (7/5) ) = (a2/a1)^(1/3 )

Multiply numerator and denominator: (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

So (a2/a1)^(1/3 ) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

Cube both sides: (a2/a1) ≈ (15/28)^3 ≈ (0.5357)^3. Let me compute that.

0.5357^3: 0.5357 * 0.5357 = approx 0.287, then 0.287 * 0.5357 ≈ 0.154. So a2/a1 ≈ 0.154.

Wait, but wait, that would mean a2 is much smaller than a1. Because 0.154 is about 1/6.5. So a2 is about 1/6.5 times a1. So a1 is about 6.5 times a2. That seems a big difference, but let's proceed.

But wait, let's double-check the calculation. Because I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is proportional to (M_p sin i)/( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (7 and 5 Earth masses, while the star is 1.5 solar masses. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So P is the orbital period, and a is related to P via Kepler's law: P² = (4π² G M_star )^-1 a^3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of K, M_p, M_star, and K.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) * 1/(c) )

Wait, no. Let's get the correct formula for K.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula that connects K, a, and M.

Wait, another source says K = (v) = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / (P)) )^(1/3), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / (P)) )^(1/3) * c^-1 ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Since both planets are detected via RV, and we have their K values (0.03 and 0.04 Å), perhaps I can find the ratio of their semi-major axes a1 and a2.

Assuming that the Doppler shifts are inversely proportional to the cube roots of their masses times the cube roots of their semi-major axes. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_p / a_p^(1/3) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mass function. The RV method gives a quantity called the mass function, which depends on the planet's mass, the inclination, and the semi-major axis. But since both planets are in the same system, the inclination is the same (probably close to 90 degrees as they transit), so sin i is about 1.

The mass function is f(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) = (K^3 P )/(2π G )

But maybe it's easier to consider that for a given star, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / a_p^(1/3) )

Wait, from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( a_p^(1/3) * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ (M_p / (a_p^(1/3) M_star^(2/3)) )

So, K1/K2 = (M1 / M2 ) * (a2/a1)^(1/3) ) * ( M_star^(2/3) / M_star^(2/3) )

Because M_star is same for both, that cancels. So K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )

Wait, no: because K1 is proportional to M1 / (a1^(1/3) ), and K2 is proportional to M2 / (a2^(1/3) ), so K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )

So, with K1 = 0.03, K2=0.04. So K1/K2 = 3/4.

So,

3/4 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )

So,

(a2/a1)^(1/3) = (3/4) * (5/7) = (15)/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

So, (a2/a1) = (0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.153.

So a2 ≈ 0.153 a1. So a1 is about 6.55 times a2.

Hmm, that's a significant difference. Now, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

Where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.

So the ratio of T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1 )) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because R_star and 2 are same for both.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

From earlier, a2/a1 = 0.153, so sqrt(0.153) ≈ 0.391.

So T_eq1 is about 0.391 times T_eq2. So the ratio is approximately 0.391, but wait, looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, wait the question is asking for the ratio of Planet1's equilibrium temperature to Planet2's, which is T1/T2.

Wait, if T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ), then T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2 a1 )) / (R/(2 a2 )) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which is sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.153)≈0.391.

But none of the options are 0.39. Hmm, the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.30, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.

Wait, 0.39 is close to 0.53 when squared? Or perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me re-check the ratios.

Wait, if a2/a1 ≈ 0.153, then a1 is larger than a2. So Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

In equilibrium temperature, T_eq is proportional to sqrt(1/a). So the planet farther away (a1) would have a lower T_eq.

So T_eq1 = T_eq2 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which would be lower than T_eq2.

So if T1 is lower than T2, then the ratio T1/T2 is less than 1.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53. Hmm, but our calculation gave around 0.39.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation. Let me recheck that.

The question says that the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å has shifts of 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So the Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c.

v is the velocity of the star.

So for Planet1:

Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ =6300 Å.

Δλ1/λ = 0.03/6300 ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = c * (Δλ/λ ) = 3e5 km/s * (4.76e-6) → wait, 3e8 m/s is 3e5 km/s.

Wait, 4.76e-6 → 3e5 km/s * 4.76e-6 = (3e5 * 4.76e-6) km/s = (3 *4.76e-1) ) km/s → 1.428 km/s.

Similarly, for Planet2:

Δλ2=0.04 → 0.04/6300 ≈6.35e-6 → v2=3e5 *6.35e-6= 1.905 km/s.

Wait, wait wait, no. Because 3e8 m/s is 3e5 km/s. So 3e8 m/s = 3e5 km/s. So when I multiply 3e5 km/s by 4.76e-6:

(3e5 km/s) * (4.76e-6) = 3e5 *4.76e-6 → 3 *4.76e-1 = 1.428 km/s.

Similarly, for Planet2, 3e5 *6.35e-6= 1.905 km/s.

Wait, but earlier I thought in m/s. Let me double-check.

Wait, I might have messed up the units. Let's compute v in m/s.

Because 1 km/s = 1e3 m/s.

So for Planet1:

v1 = 3e8 m/s * (0.03/6300) → 3e8 * (0.03)/(6300) → 3e8 * 4.76e-6 → 3e8 *4.76e-6 = 1.428e3 m/s → 1428 m/s.

Same for Planet2:

v2 = 3e8 * 0.04/(6300) → 3e8 *6.35e-6 → 1.905e3 m/s → 1905 m/s.

So earlier calculation was correct.

So K1 = 1428 m/s, K2 =1905 m/s.

So K1/K2 = 1428/1905 ≈ 0.75 (exactly 0.75, since 1428 is 0.75 of 1904? Let me check: 0.75 * 1905 = 1428.75, which is close to 1428, so it's approximately 0.75).

So K1/K2 = 3/4.

Now, using the earlier approach:

K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( a_p^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

As before, M1=7, M2=5.

So,

3/4 = (7/5) * (a2/a1)^(1/3 )

So,

(a2/a1)^(1/3) = (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

Thus, a2/a1 = (0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.153.

So a1 is about 6.55 a2.

Now, equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.153) ≈ 0.391.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in relating K to a.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Doppler shifts are inversely proportional to the planet's distance. Because a larger planet would cause a larger shift, but if it's farther away, the effect would be smaller. So K should be inversely proportional to a^(1/3) perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's distance.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( a_p^(1/3) )

Which would lead to K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

Which is what I used earlier.

Wait, but another approach: using the star's velocity and Kepler's third law.

From Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G M_star ) a^3 )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) / c 

Wait, but this seems too vague. Let me try to find another way.

Another formula I found is:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3) ) )

Because from Kepler's law, P² = (4 π² a^3) / (G M_star ), so P^(1/3) = [ (4 π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) ]^(1/6 ) = (4 π²)^(1/6 ) a^(1/2) (G M_star )^(-1/6 )

Wait, perhaps substituting P into the K equation:

K = [ (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p) ) ] / [ (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ]

Substituting P from Kepler's law:

P = sqrt( (4 π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) )

So,

P^(1/3) = [ (4 π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) ]^(1/6 ) = (4^(1/6)) ( π^(1/3) ) a^(1/2) ( G^(-1/6) ) ( M_star^(-1/6) )

Putting this into K:

K = [ (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_p ] / [ (M_star )^(2/3) * (4^(1/6) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6) ) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

4^(1/6) is 2^(1/3), π^(1/3), G^(-1/6), and M_star^( -1/6 + 2/3 ) → M_star^( ( -1/6 +4/6 )= 3/6=1/2 )

So denominator is 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2 )

Numerator is (2^(1/3) π^(1/3) G^(1/3) ) M_p.

So,

K = [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) G^(1/3) M_p ] / [ 2^(1/3) π^(1/3) a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

The 2^(1/3) and π^(1/3) terms cancel.

So,

K = [ G^(1/3) M_p ] / [ a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

Because G^(1/3) / G^(-1/6 ) = G^(1/3 +1/6 )= G^(1/2 )

So,

K = [ G^(1/2) M_p ] / [ a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ]

= [ M_p * sqrt(G) ] / [ sqrt(a) * sqrt(M_star) ) ]

= ( M_p / sqrt( M_star ) ) * sqrt( G / a )

So,

K = M_p / sqrt( M_star a )

But since M_star is same for both, so K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / sqrt(a1) ) / ( M_p2 / sqrt(a2) ) ) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

But earlier I thought K was proportional to (M_p / a^(1/3) ), but now I have it as (M_p / sqrt(a) ).

So this is a different relation.

So given that, K1/K2 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We have K1/K2 = 3/4.

So,

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So,

sqrt(a2/a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28 ) ≈0.5357.

So,

a2/a1 = (0.5357 )^2 ≈ 0.287.

So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Hmm, this is different from earlier. So which is correct?

I think I might have messed up the formula earlier. Now, with this new approach, K1/K2 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So,

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So,

sqrt(a2/a1 )= (3/4) * (5/7 ) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

Thus,

a2/a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So a1 = a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2.

Now, equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1 )) / (R_star/(2a2 )) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.287 )≈ 0.536.

Which is approximately 0.53, which matches option C.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is ~0.53, meaning Planet1 is cooler than Planet2, which makes sense because it's farther away (a1 is larger than a2).

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) of a planet is proportional to \( \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{a}} \), where \( R_{\star} \) is the radius of the star and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet from the star. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances:  

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) can be determined using the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( M_p \) is the planet's mass. Thus, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes gives:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å} \), \( K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å} \), \( M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}} \), and \( M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{3}{4}, \quad \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

\[
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Solving for \( \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28} \approx 0.5357
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Now, substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \) into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This result matches option C, which is approximately \( 0.53 \). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is **0.53**.
