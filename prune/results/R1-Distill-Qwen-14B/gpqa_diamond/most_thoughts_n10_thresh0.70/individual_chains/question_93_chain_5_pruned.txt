Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA by amplifying it. The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA.

The RÂ² is 1, which indicates a perfect correlation between the dilutions and the Ct values. So the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Wait, the slope in the qPCR equation is related to efficiency. The formula for the slope is usually ln(10)/slope. Oh wait, I think the formula is efficiency = 10^(-1/slope). Because the equation for qPCR is Ct = (log(target) + intercept) / (slope). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh right, the standard formula is Ct = (log10(initial copies) + intercept) / slope. The efficiency E is given by 10^(-1/slope). So if the slope is -3.3, then 1/slope is approximately -0.303. So 10^0.303 is about 2, which makes sense because 100% efficiency would give a slope of -3.3219, I think. Because ln(2
