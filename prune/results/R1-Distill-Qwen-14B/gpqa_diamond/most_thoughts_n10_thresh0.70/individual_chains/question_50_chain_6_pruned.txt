Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about determining the number of loops in a Feynman diagram based on the given "size estimate" expression. The expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process. Each loop contributes a factor of a certain term, usually involving the coupling constants and possibly some other constants.

Wait, I think the general structure for the amplitude of a Feynman diagram is something like (coupling)^n * (loop integrals). The loop integrals often involve factors from integrations over loop momenta, which can include terms like 1/(16 pi^2) per loop. Or wait, wait, maybe each loop contributes a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) multiplied by some log terms or something else, depending on the renormalization group stuff.

Wait, looking at the given expression: let's break down each factor. The expression is a product of several terms:

- alpha^3: alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4 pi epsilon_0) or something like that. But in QFT, alpha is a coupling constant, and each vertex in a Feynman diagram brings in a factor of alpha. So if a diagram has V vertices, each contributing alpha, then the amplitude would have alpha^V.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Alternatively, in QED, each photon vertex has a factor of alpha, which is e^2/(4 pi), so each loop might involve some powers of alpha, but perhaps more importantly, loop integrals contribute factors involving 1/(16 pi^2) per loop, as each loop integral in four dimensions (like a Feynman integral) typically has a logarithmic divergence and is regularized or renormalized with that factor.

Wait, the expression given has (4 pi)^-6. Let's see: (4pi)^6 would be (4pi)^{2*3}, so 3 loops perhaps? Because each loop contributes a
