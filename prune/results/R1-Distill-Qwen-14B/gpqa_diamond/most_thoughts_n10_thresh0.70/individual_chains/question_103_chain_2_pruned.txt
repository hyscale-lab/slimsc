Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which sequence of reactions will give me 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds, the order of functional groups addition matters because some reactions are more reactive than others.

The target molecule has bromine and nitro groups attached to the benzene ring, and a ketone group (ethan-1-one) which is a substitution on the ring. Wait, actually, the ketone is a substituent on the benzene. So, the structure should be a benzene ring with a nitro group at position 5, bromine at position 3, and the ketone (from ethan-1-one) at position 1. Wait, but I'm not sure about the numbering. Let me visualize it: ethan-1-one is a ketone group on a carbon attached to the benzene, so it's a phenyl ketone. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3, 5, and the ketone is at position 1? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone. The phenyl has substituents at positions 3 and 5: bromo and nitro. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1, which is the same as the point of attachment to the ethanone.

But wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me draw it. Benzene ring: the ketone is attached to carbon 1, then the bromo is at carbon 3, and nitro at carbon 5. So, positions 1, 3, 5 are all substituted. So, the substituents are at the meta positions relative to each other. So, the nitro is at position 5 (which is meta to position 3), and the ketone is at position 1. So, for the synthesis, I need to introduce a nitro group, a bromine, and a ketone group in the correct positions.

But wait, how do the directing effects of the substituents affect the order of reactions
