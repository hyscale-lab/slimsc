Okay, so I've got this question here about a ribonucleoprotein particle and a nascent chain meeting. Hmm, I remember that ribonucleoproteins are involved in various cellular processes. The question is about where they met and where the chain is going next.

Let me think. The conversation sounds a bit like a ribosome and a nascent polypeptide chain. Oh wait, because ribosomes are made of rRNA and proteins, so they're ribonucleoprotein particles. Right, so when a ribosome is making a protein, the nascent chain is being synthesized.

The particle says, "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar." So, adding sugar rings a bell. Oh yeah, glycosylation! That's when carbohydrates (sugars) are added to the protein. And where does that happen? I think it's in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus.

Wait, but the ribosome is attached to the ER when it's making proteins destined for secretion or membranes. So the ribosome is the one making the chain on the rough ER. So the meeting place is the ribosome, which is attached to the ER. But the question says where did they meet, and where is the chain heading.

The chain replies, "It seems somewhat rough. I guess this is goodbye; I need to be on my way." Rough... Oh, rough ER. So the chain is leaving the ribosome attached to the rough ER. So where's the chain going now? Well, the next stop for a nascent protein that's being secreted or used in the cell membrane would be the Golgi apparatus.

Wait, but let me think again. The ribonucleoprotein is the ribosome. Then, they meet, and the ribosome (particle) directs the chain to the ER. So the meeting place is the ribosome, which is at the ER.

So, the chain starts at the ribosome (rough ER), and then moves to the Golgi. So the first part is ribosome to Golgi?

Looking at the options:

Option B: ribosome to proteasome. Wait, proteasome is for protein degradation. So unless it's a misfolded protein, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option D: Golgi to mitochondrion. No, because the chain would be leaving the Golgi, not going there.

Option A: cytosol to extracellular. No, the chain is synthesized on the ER, so the ribosome is on the ER, not in the cytosol.

So, the meeting is on the ribosome, which
