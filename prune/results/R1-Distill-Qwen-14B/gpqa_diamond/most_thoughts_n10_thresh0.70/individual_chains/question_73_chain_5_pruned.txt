Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity, which I find a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, so the question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, relative speed. Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. I remember something about the velocity addition formula. Like, you can't just subtract their speeds because that would sometimes give a speed faster than light, which isn't possible.

So the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v relative to the same inertial frame (like the Earth) is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait no, is that right? Or is it (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²) when they're moving in opposite directions? Wait, no, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed of one as seen from the other would be (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), right?

Wait, let me get that straight. Let me think: If one object is moving at u and another at v in the same direction, from the perspective of the first object, the second is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) maybe? Or is it (u
