Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that there's a planet with 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet's orbital period is 3 days, and the transit impact parameter is 0.2. Then there's a second planet with 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it both transits and occults. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm. Wait, transit and occultation. So transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose the planet's light, like a disappearance event. For both to happen, the second planet must be in a position where its orbit is such that it can both pass in front and behind the star relative to our line of sight. That probably means it's in an outer orbit compared to the first planet because, if it's outside, it can both eclipse the star (transit) and be eclipsed by the star (occultation).

Wait, but the problem asks for the maximum orbital period of the second planet that allows both events. So the condition is that the orbital period of the second planet must be longer than the first's for it to be further out, but not too long that the events can't happen.

Wait,
