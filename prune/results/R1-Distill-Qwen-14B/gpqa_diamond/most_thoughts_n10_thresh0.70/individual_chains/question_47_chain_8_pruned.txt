Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what the data says and the options provided.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11)/2= 9/2=4.5? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I should use the formula correctly. The formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, for this case, X is 0, N is 1. So (2*9 + 2 -11 +1)/2. Let me compute that. 2*9 is 18, plus 2 is 20. 20 minus 11 is 9, plus 1 is 10. 10/2 is 5. So DoU is 5. Hmm. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) plus maybe an ester or amide group, which each have one. So could be a benzene ring, an ester group, and another ring? Or perhaps a benzene ring, an ester group, and a double bond or something else.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. Wait, but 3325 is a bit on the higher side, maybe an amide N-H or an amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. That's probably an ester or amide. Because in esters, the carbonyl is around 1740-1720, and amides are lower, like 1680-1700. Wait, but 1720 is more ester-like. Or maybe it's an acid, but the 1720 could also be an acid if it's in a different environment. But considering the molecular formula, O2 is present, but it's more likely an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, integrating for three protons. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet comes from the CH3 being next to a CH2 that's adjacent to something else, maybe an oxygen. So maybe an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for two protons. Could be an N-H or maybe some kind of exchange, but broad suggests maybe an amine or amide protons. But wait, amide protons are usually around 8-9 ppm as broad signals, aren't they? Or maybe something else. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, but the broadness is confusing. Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group, but I'm not sure.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet, integrating for two protons. Quartet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. Wait, what else? Maybe a CH2 connected to something else, like an oxygen or a carbonyl.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons. That's probably aromatic protons. Maybe in a para-substituted benzene, where two protons are next to substituents.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet for two protons. Also aromatic. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the neighboring protons would give a doublet each.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is an aryl ring with an ester group attached. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide (a benzene ring with a CONH2 group) with an ethoxy group at the 3 position. So the ring would have substituents at positions 3 and something else? Wait, benzamide is a CONH2 group attached to benzene. So if it's 3-ethoxy, the substituents are at 3 (ethoxy) and 1 (CONH2?), but wait, benzamide is directly attached, so maybe it's a meta substitution.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide group is HCONH- attached to a benzene ring that's ethoxy at the para position. So benzene has substituents at 4 (ethoxy) and the formamide group at another position, perhaps para to that, but I'm not sure.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO
