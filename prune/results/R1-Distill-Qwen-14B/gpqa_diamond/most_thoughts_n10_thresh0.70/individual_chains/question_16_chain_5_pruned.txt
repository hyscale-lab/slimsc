Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what optical activity means. A compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Or wait, are there other possibilities? Oh right, some compounds can be chiral without having a single chiral center, like those with allenes or other types of stereogenic elements, but I think the main focus here is on chiral centers.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, this is an alkene with substituents. The configuration is Z. Wait, but does the double bond have any substituents that would make it a stereocenter? Let's draw the structure. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait no, wait. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, no. Let me clarify. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But in this case, it's 1-chloro, so the Cl is on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but that's not correct. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would mean Cl is on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is the double bond carbon.

Wait, but CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, but that's four carbons
