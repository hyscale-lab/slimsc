Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states: We've got an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So I'm thinking this is an electrostatics problem involving electric potential energy. Since all the charges are identical, they're all either positive or negative. Wait, each has a charge of 2e. Well, e is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C. But wait, the sign matters for the potential energy. Since all are identical, let's assume they're positive, so they'll repel each other. But wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify the sign, but given that 12 are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, I think the setup would have the 13th charge being fixed, so perhaps the others are arranged around it.

Wait, but the 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P. So point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. So the 13th charge is q13, and the other 12 are each at radius 2 m around P. So the system comprises a central charge and 12 surrounding charges.

But wait, for potential energy, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since all the particles are identical, maybe we can compute it in a more efficient way.

So the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

But wait, in this case, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, which is where the
