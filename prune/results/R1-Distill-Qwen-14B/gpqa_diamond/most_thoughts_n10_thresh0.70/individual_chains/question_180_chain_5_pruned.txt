Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay. So, I'm thinking about electric potential energy here. Because when you have charges in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy. Since the system is isolated, we're probably looking at electrostatic potential energy.

Wait, so the setup is that there's a central charge at point P, and 12 other charges are all at a fixed radius (2 meters) from P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the 12 charges are arranged in some way around P, but it's not specified. Oh wait, wait a second. The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So, they're all on a sphere of radius 2m around P, but their exact positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, but how does that affect the potential energy?

I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But when there are multiple charges, you have to consider all possible pairs because each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

But wait, in this case, the central charge is fixed, so maybe it's only interacting with the 12 surrounding charges. Let me think. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So perhaps the 12 charges are all at 2m distance from P, but they can move on that sphere. But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So regardless of their positions relative to each other, each is at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge at P.

Wait, but the 12 could be arranged in any way on that sphere. So, for the potential energy, do I need to consider the interactions between the 12 charges themselves as well as their interaction with the
