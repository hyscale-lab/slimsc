Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm.

First, I need to understand the state that's given. The state is |alpha>, and it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional means it's a scalar multiple, but since we're dealing with probabilities, the normalization will take care of the constants. But I think I should normalize it first.

So, the state can be written as |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>, where 'a' is the normalization constant. Wait, no, actually, the state is already given as proportional, so I think the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and I need to normalize it. So the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Let me calculate the coefficients. The first coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. The second coefficient is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5. So the total is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Okay, now the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that look like as a matrix? Since it's a 2x2 matrix (since we have two states, up and down), the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the matrix is 2x2. So when
