Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to start breaking it down.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

First, I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So, the matrix A is given by A_ij = hbar/2 when iâ‰ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because we're dealing with two states (up and down), so the dimensions must be 2x2.

Let me write down what operator A looks like. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are 0, and the off-diagonal elements A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2. So the matrix would be:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Wait, sigma_x is (|up><down| + |down><up|). So the operator A is proportional to sigma_x.

Now, eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the operator A, since A is a multiple of sigma_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. Let me recall what those are.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the superpositions of |up> and |down> that are symmetric and antisymmetric. Like, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |âˆ’x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). These are the eigenstates for sigma_x, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So the eigenstates of A would be the same, but scaled by hbar/2.

Wait, no, because A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |âˆ’x>, and the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But the question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates of A when the state is |alpha>.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says: "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator". So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |âˆ’x>, so the possible outcomes are these states, each with their own probabilities.

So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |
