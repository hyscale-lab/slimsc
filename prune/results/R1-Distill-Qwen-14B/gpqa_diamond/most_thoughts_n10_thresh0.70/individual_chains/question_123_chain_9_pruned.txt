Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Interesting, so it's a relative velocity thing.

The question is asking: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh right, and we can ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So, it's just a straightforward velocity problem, I think.

Wait, so I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially in special relativity, there's the concept of time dilation and length contraction. But wait, this problem might not require that because it's just about relative velocity without acceleration. Or maybe it's just a classical mechanics problem? Hmm, the question mentions that both are inertial frames, which is a hint towards Galilean relativity, not special relativity because special relativity involves non-inertial frames or acceleration, but the problem states both are inertial. Wait, but wait, in special relativity, velocity transformations are different from Galilean.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention anything about the speed being a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: 60,000 km/s. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light, which is 20% of c. Hmm, that's a decent fraction. So relativistic effects might come into play.

But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, revolution, but it doesn't say anything about relativity. Oh, but the problem is about inertial frames, so perhaps we need to use the Lorentz transformation or something from special relativity. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the Galaxy's frame would have the ejecta moving at the same speed but in the opposite direction, right? Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly, but
