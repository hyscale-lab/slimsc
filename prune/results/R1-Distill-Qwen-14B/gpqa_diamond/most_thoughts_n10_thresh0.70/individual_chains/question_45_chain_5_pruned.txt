Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to it, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, right, in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula I remember is E_n = (n² pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. The problem gives E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so E is proportional to n². So the energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each energy level can have at most two particles because each energy level in a 1D box has a spin multiplicity of 2s +1, which is 2 for spin-1/2. So each energy level can hold two particles.

The system is four particles, so we need to fill up the energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion principle.

Let me think about the possible states. Since the particles are fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D box, the quantum number is just n. But since spin is involved, each n can have two possible spin states (up and down). So each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles, let's see how they fill up the levels.

Ground state: the lowest energy is n=1, which can hold 2 particles. Then the next energy level is n=2, which can hold another 2 particles. So in the ground state, we have two particles in n=1 (each with opposite spins) and two in n=2.

So the energies would be E_1 for n=1, and E_2 for n=2.

Wait, E_1 = 1² E = E, E_2 = 4E.

So the total energy in the ground state would be 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10 E. Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me check the
