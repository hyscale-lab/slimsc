Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. So the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, actually, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer. Right, because parallax is the apparent shift in position due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution would imply that the number density of stars is constant in all directions. So, in terms of space, let's imagine spherical shells around the Earth. Each shell represents a certain distance. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of that shell.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is inversely related to distance, so I should probably think in terms of parallax rather than distance.

Let me think about the relationship between distance and volume. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell (which is 4πd²) multiplied by dr. But since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars N is proportional to 4πd² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's express everything in terms of plx. Then, d = 1/plx, and dr = derivative of d with respect to plx? Wait, maybe I should find how dr relates to a change in plx.

Let me compute dr in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with ranges, maybe I can ignore the sign and just take the magnitude.

So substituting d and dr into the number of stars N:

N ∝ 4π (d)^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx² dplx) )

Wait, wait, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check. Let
