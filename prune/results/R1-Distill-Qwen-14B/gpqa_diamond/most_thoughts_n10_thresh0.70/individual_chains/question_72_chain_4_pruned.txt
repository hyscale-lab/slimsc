Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis pathways. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with this compound: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I think that's a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, right? And here it's diene, so two double bonds? Or maybe a conjugated diene. Anyway, the substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh wait, what's that about? Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, maybe in a substitution reaction. The other compound has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons of a cyclohexadiene.

Wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Because norbornene is a diene, and the other molecule has a diene as well but with substituents. Oh wait, the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So it's a cyclohexene derivative with two substituents at positions 5 and 6, each being dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, when two equivalents are used, perhaps a double addition. So maybe each equivalent adds a group to the norbornene. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the iodide is a nucleophile, but wait, sodium iodide is present, which would provide iodide ions.

Wait another approach: the dibromomethyl groups have two bromines attached to a methyl group. So each is Br2C- attached to the cyclohexadiene.

In the presence of NaI, perhaps an SN2 substitution reaction. So the dibromomethyl groups would undergo substitution. But wait, dibromomethyl is Br2CH2-, so each of those substituents could lose Br- in an SN2 reaction, but wait, it's more likely that each Br would be replaced by something else.

Wait, but if you have two equivalents of the
