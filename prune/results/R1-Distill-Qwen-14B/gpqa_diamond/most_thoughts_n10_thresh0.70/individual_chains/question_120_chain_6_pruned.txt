Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance to a star. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, a star with a higher parallax is closer to us.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that the number of stars in a given volume of space is the same everywhere. But wait, wait. No, wait—uniform distribution in what sense? Oh, wait, in three-dimensional space, stars are spread out uniformly. So the number density is constant.

I think the key here is to relate the volume of space that a given parallax range covers. Parallax, in this context, is the difference in parallax between two points. So if I consider stars with parallax between plx and plx + d(plx), how many stars are in that range?

Wait, I should probably model this. Let's think about a shell of stars at a certain distance. The parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so distance d = 1/plx. So for a small change in parallax d(plx), what's the corresponding change in distance?

Let me model this. Let's say plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Then, the distance corresponding to plx is d = 1/plx. The next distance would be for plx + d_plx, which is d' = 1/(plx + d_plx). Hmm, but for small d_plx, maybe I can approximate this.

The change in distance dd is approximately the derivative of d with respect to plx. So, d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx^2) d_plx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases. But since we're dealing with ranges, the magnitude is what matters. So the thickness of the shell at a distance d is proportional to 1/(plx^2) * d_plx.

But wait, the number of stars in a shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars. Since the distribution is uniform, the number density is constant. So the number of stars N in a shell between plx and plx + d_plx should be proportional to the volume of that shell.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So substituting d = 1/plx, we get:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2) d_plx) ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the shell's thickness is dd, which I found earlier is approximately (1/plx²) d_plx. So substituting d = 1/plx, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2) d_plx) )?

Wait, that would be 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/(plx^2)) d_plx. Wait, that seems like 4π d_plx / plx^4. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me redo this.

Wait, the volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance here). So for our case, r is 1/plx. So dr = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx times d_plx.

So dr = (-1/plx²) d_plx. The negative is just direction, so the absolute value is dr = (1/plx²) d_plx.

So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d_plx) = 4π (1 / plx^4) d_plx.

Wait, that seems a bit off because I thought the number of stars would depend on the volume. So the number of stars in the shell (per unit plx) would be proportional to the volume, which is proportional to 1/plx^4 times d_plx. But
