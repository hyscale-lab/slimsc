Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, let me think. It's about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles the same, right? So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, rhombohedral usually has threefold symmetry with all edges equal and all angles the same. So yeah, that's correct here.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in a crystal structure, the interatomic distance can refer to the edge length of the unit cell. So in a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice parameter 'a' is the interatomic distance. So here, a = 10 Angstrom.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula from Bragg's law: d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ). Wait, no, wait. Or is that another formula? Wait, no, I think that's the formula for the Miller indices when the angles aren't 90 degrees.
