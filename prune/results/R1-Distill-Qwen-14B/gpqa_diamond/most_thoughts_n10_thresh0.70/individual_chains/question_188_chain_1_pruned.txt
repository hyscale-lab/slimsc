Alright, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

Okay, I remember that rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, actually rhombohedral is part of the cubic system. Or wait, maybe it's a separate system. Wait, no, I think rhombohedral is a special case where all edges are equal and the angles are all the same but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance probably refers to the lattice parameter 'a', the edge length of the unit cell. So a = 10 Å.

I need to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane. The formula I recall for interplanar distances in crystals is the Bragg's law formula, but more directly, the formula for d_hkl is a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cosθ)), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h²
