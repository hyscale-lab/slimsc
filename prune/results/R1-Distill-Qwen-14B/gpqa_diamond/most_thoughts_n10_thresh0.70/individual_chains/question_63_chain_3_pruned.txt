Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we're supposed to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will take the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, molecules can absorb photons that cause transitions between energy states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, I think. So the next state after that would be the first excited state.

Wait, the molecule is diatomic, so it has both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which probably means that the bond length isn't fixed, but for the sake of this problem, maybe we can treat it as a rigid rotor for the rotational part and a harmonic oscillator for the vibrational part. Because the question is about the next lowest energy state, I'm guessing that might involve a change in vibrational state or rotational state, or both.

Let me think about the energy levels. In the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, but the bond length isn't fixed. But I'm not very clear on that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying it by considering the rigid rotor approximation for the rotational part and the harmonic oscillator approximation for the vibrational part. Because that's a common approach in such problems.

Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, so that's probably for the vibrational part. So the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. To reach the next state, the lowest possible energy, I think that would be the first excited vibrational state. Because in the vibrational energy levels, each transition is a quantum jump from v=0 to v=1. Alternatively, maybe the rotational state transitions could contribute as well, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy transition would be a single quantum jump in the vibrational state, or perhaps a change in rotational state?

Wait, but the next state with the lowest energy after the fundamental state would depend on the energy spacing between the states. The vibrational energy levels are spaced by hν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. The rotational energy levels have a spacing that depends on the moment of inertia
