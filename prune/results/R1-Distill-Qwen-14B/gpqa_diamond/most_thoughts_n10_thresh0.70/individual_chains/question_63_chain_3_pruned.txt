Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest energy. Let me try to break this down.

The molecule is made up of atoms X and Y. The given masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the photon momentum required for it to move to the next state.

Wait, the model here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that this model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. But wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that implies a transition that requires the least energy, so probably the smallest possible energy change.

In the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the vibrational energy levels are quantized. The energy levels are given by Ev = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The fundamental state is v=0, so the next state would be v=1. So the energy difference ΔE between v=0 and v=1 would be ħω.

But wait, the problem is about a rotation-vibration model. Oh right, the rigid rotor model treats rotation, and the non-rigid rotor might allow for some stretching, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Wait, perhaps the question is more about the transition between states in the rotational-vibrational coupling, but maybe it's simpler than that. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, and the transition is a vibrational one.

Wait, the question also mentions that the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), I think. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, perhaps the next state with the lowest energy would involve the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1). Hmm, but which transition requires less energy?

The energy levels for rotation are given by E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy from the harmonic oscillator is Ev = (v + 1/2) ħω. So the vibrational energy spacing is ħω (from v=0 to v=1), and the rotational energy spacing for J=0 to J=1 is E_J = (1(1+1) - 0) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = (2)(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I).

So which is smaller, ħω or ħ²/(I)? Let's compute both.

First, I need to find the moment of inertia I. I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. So, μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But converting to kg. 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ let me calculate that.

1.818 * 1.66 ≈ about 3.008. So 3.008e-27 kg. Then R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = (3.008e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute R squared: (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I = 3.008e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2032e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ħ²/(I): ħ is approx 1.05e-34 J s. So ħ² is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.10e-68 (J s)^2. Then ħ²/I ≈ 1.10e-68 / 1.2032e-46 ≈ approximately 9.14e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is ħω. ω is 4e14 rad/s. So ħω = 1.05e-34 *4e14 = 4.2e-20 J.

Compare the two: 9.14e-23 J (rotational) vs 4.2e-20 J (vibrational). So the rotational energy difference is much smaller. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the J=1 rotational state, since that transition requires less energy than the vibrational.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon absorbed. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between two states. So if the molecule is absorbing a photon, the energy of the photon must be equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states.

So the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE = E_final - E_initial.

In the initial state, which is the fundamental state, the molecule is in the lowest possible energy, which is J=0, v=0. So the next lowest state would be J=1, v=0, or J=0, v=1.

Wait, but J=0 to J=1 would require ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) * (J(J+1) terms). Let me recalculate that.

Wait, E_J = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1). So for J=0, E0 = 0. For J=1, E1 = (ħ²/(2I)) * 2. So ΔE (rot) is 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/(I) = same as before, 9.14e-23 J.

But the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω = 4.2e-20 J. So since 9e-23 is smaller, the photon needs to have energy 9.14e-23 J to cause a rotational transition, or 4.2e-20 J for a vibrational transition. But the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, so that would be the rotational transition requiring less energy.

Wait, but wait a second. The vibrational energy is much higher. So if the molecule is in the ground state (J=0, v=0), absorbing a photon with energy 9e-23 J would take it to J=1, v=0. Alternatively, absorbing a photon with 4.2e-20 J would take it to J=0, v=1. But since the question is about the next lowest energy state, which is the rotational transition, because that requires less energy.

So the photon energy is E_photon =
