Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two signals as singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three signals at 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think about each option's structure. All the options are substituted benzenes with methyl groups except option C, which has diethyl groups.

So each compound is C10H14. Let's check that. Benzene is C6H6. If there are four methyl groups, each adds a CH3, so 4*3=12 H. So C6H6 + 4CH3 would be C10H18. But the molecular formula is C10H14. Oh wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Another possibility is that in some cases, it's not all methyl groups. Like, perhaps some substituents are ethyl groups instead.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So four methyl groups. That would be C6H5 + 4*CH3. So C10H14? Let's see: Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl adds 3 H, but since each substitution replaces a H, the total H would be 6 - 4 (since four substituents) + 4*3 = 6 -4 +12=14. Yes, so C10H14. Same for other tetramethylbenzenes.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Same calculation, so C10H14.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Again, same as above. Wait no, option C is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Oh, because diethyl would be two ethyl groups. So benzene with two ethyl substituents. Each ethyl is
