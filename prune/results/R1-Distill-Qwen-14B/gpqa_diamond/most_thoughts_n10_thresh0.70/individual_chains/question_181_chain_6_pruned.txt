Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain part of the fusion process stops. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would take that time to reach us, but the neutrinos would still be produced as per the current fusion rates before the change. Wait, but the pp-III stopped, so what was pp-III?

I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. There are a couple of branches. The pp-I branch leads to the production of deuterium. Then, in pp-II, the deuterium fuses with a proton to form tritium, which later decays into helium-3. The pp-III branch probably involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei to form carbon-12, right? Or wait, maybe another step. Oh, perhaps the pp chains are the initial steps, and pp-III is a specific part.

Wait, I think the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main branch, pp-I, produces deuterium. Then, in pp-II, the deuterium fuses with a proton to become tritium, which then decays into helium-3. The pp-III branch probably involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei to form carbon-12, which can then go on to form carbon-16 and eventually iron via other processes. Alternatively, another possibility is that the pp-III branch is a specific part of the fusion process that produces certain neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrinos produced? Well, the Sun emits neutrinos primarily from two main processes: the proton-proton chain (pp) and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp chain, specifically the decay of boron-8, which is a product of the pp chain.

Wait, but the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. So the problem must relate to the neutrinos produced by the pp chain, likely the electron neutrinos from the decay of Beryllium-7 in the pp chain.

But
