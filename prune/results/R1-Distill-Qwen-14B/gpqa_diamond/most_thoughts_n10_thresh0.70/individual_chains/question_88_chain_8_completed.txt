Okay, so I've got this question here about rotavirus and some experiments involving GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So the setup is that they're tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and giving them to mice orally. Then they're doing in vivo imaging and observing some issues. Some of the fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, which makes sense because the stomach has a lot of acid. Then some are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Wait, secondary lymphoid organs are like places where immune responses happen, like Peyer's patches.

They identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. So Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? And when they sequence the variable heavy chain gene, they see high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that the cells are undergoing some kind of diversification.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. I remember that this process occurs in B cells during the immune response. It's a way to increase the diversity of antibodies after the B cell receptor binds to an antigen. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, which is where B cells proliferate and mutate their genes.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the immune response, where complement proteins are activated to attack pathogens. But I don't think complement activation directly causes variability in the variable regions. It's more about killing or marking pathogens.

Option C: Class switching recombination. That's when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces, like from IgM to IgG or IgA. This doesn't change the variable regions but the constant regions, so the variable heavy chain wouldn't show high variability due to this. Plus, the question is about variable chain gene sequencing.

Option D: VDJ recombination. That's the process during B cell development where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the variable region of the B cell receptor. This happens in the bone marrow for B cells, and it's the initial diversification of the receptors. But if they're already in the Peyer patches and are proliferating, I think this would have already happened earlier, during development.

So, the scenario: the GFP-tagged proteins are delivered, some reach the Peyer's patches. In the Peyer's patches, the B cells (or other immune cells) are proliferating and their variable heavy chains show high variability. That sounds a lot like somatic hypermutation because that process introduces point mutations in the variable regions to fine-tune the antigen receptors. This happens after the initial VDJ recombination, especially in germinal centers where B cells undergo proliferation and mutation.

Wait, but the question says they're looking at the variable heavy chain after isolating the proliferating cells. Somatic hypermutation happens during the germinal center reaction, which involves proliferation. So the high variability would be because each cell's receptors are mutating, leading to different sequences. So the process is somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence is observed in the Peyer patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs. Isolating the proliferating cell population from these patches and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability. This suggests a process that diversifies the variable regions of the immune receptors.

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation** is a process where B cells introduce mutations in the variable regions of their B cell receptors during the germinal center reaction. This process increases diversity and fine-tunes antigen recognition, aligning with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Option B: Complement activation** involves the activation of complement proteins to target pathogens but does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **Option C: Class switching recombination** changes the class of antibody produced by B cells (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **Option D: VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the initial variable region. However, this process happens earlier in development and does not account for the observed variability in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene observed in the proliferating cells is consistent with **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches. This process explains the diversification of the immune receptors in response to the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins.
