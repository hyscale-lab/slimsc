Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

The given data includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR. Let me go through each part one by one.

First, the mass spec: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest. There's another peak at m/z 158, which is 32%. Hmm, molecular ion usually corresponds to the molecular weight. But wait, 158 is higher than 156. That makes me think about possible fragmentations or maybe a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5, so Cl-35 and Cl-37. But how does that affect the molecular ion?

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156. So the molecular weight is 156. The other peak at 158 would be 2 amu higher. That suggests a molecule with a chlorine atom because Cl has two major isotopes. The molecular ion is the M peak (156) and M+2 (158), which would be 35Cl to 37Cl. So the presence of Cl is likely.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That peak is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). A strong peak around 1700-1750 is typical for carbonyls. So, maybe a carboxylic acid or an ester or something similar.

Looking at the 1H NMR: let's break it down. 

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. In aromatic compounds, protons are usually around 7 ppm. Wait, 11 ppm is extremely upfield or downfield? Oh, wait, no, 11 is very downfield. For aromatic protons, 11 is way high. Wait, but in aldehydes, the proton is around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in carboxylic acids, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, and it's a broad peak. But here it's a singlet at 11.0. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton? Or perhaps an acidic proton like from a phenol or carboxylic acid.

Wait, the IR had a broad peak which could be -OH from a carboxylic acid. So maybe that's the 11.0 ppm peak. But the 1H NMR for a carboxylic acid's -OH is usually a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's a different kind of proton. Alternatively, maybe it's not -OH but something else. Wait, what about an aldehyde? Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm as a triplet, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, another option: maybe it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to an aromatic ring, like a ketone, but that wouldn't explain the broad peak in IR. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl, like a benzaldehyde, but then the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10.

Wait, but the NMR shows 11.0. Maybe it's a phenolic -OH? No, phenolic OHs are usually around 5-7 ppm, but they
