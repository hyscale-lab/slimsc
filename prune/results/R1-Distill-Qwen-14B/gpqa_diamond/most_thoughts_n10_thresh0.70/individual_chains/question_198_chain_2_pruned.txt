Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M and thiocyanate is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. So, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n varies. The stability constant βn would be for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). I remember that the stability constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So, for each n, βn is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)n]^(2−n).

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so that's n=2. The blue complex is probably [Co(SCN)₂]^(2−2) → [Co(SCN)₂]^(0?), but wait, Co is +2, each SCN is -, so 2 SCN would make the charge 0. So the complex is neutral, but I think the charge might not matter for the stability constant's purpose here.

Wait, the stability constants are β1, β2, β3, β4. So I think each β corresponds to the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+ , since Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+ → charge is 2+ + (-1) = +1. So β1 is for n=1.

Similarly, β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, because 2 SCN- would be -2, so Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- makes 0 charge. So β2 is 40.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So the species is [Co(SCN)₂]^(0).

But the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the complexes are ordered from n=1 to n=4, but I'm not sure which β corresponds to which n. Wait, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, so β1 is for n=1. Then β2 is for n=2, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0. β3 would be [Co(SCN)3]^−, and β4 [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

But wait, the order of β values is 9, 40, 63, 16. So β3 is the largest. Hmm, that suggests that the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)3]^−. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complexes. So we need to find the fraction of all
