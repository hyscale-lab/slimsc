Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I know that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of sigma_z, which makes sense because sigma_z is one of the Pauli matrices. 

The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh right, expectation values. So I think I need to calculate <ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ> and find its value.

Let me break this down. The expectation value is linear, so I can separate it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That sounds manageable.

First, I should find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. For σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ plus sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's compute the coefficients squared to get the probabilities. The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so its probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Next, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. I remember that the eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But in this case, the state isn't in the σx eigenbasis, so I can't directly say the expectation value is the eigenvalue times the probability. I'll have to compute it more directly.

The operator σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I can write out the expectation value as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me write the state ψ as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0, 1), ψ would be [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, |↑⟩ is typically represented as spin-up, which in Dirac notation is (1, 0), and |↓⟩ is (0, 1). So ψ is 0.5*(1,0) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0,1) → [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, to compute ⟨σx⟩, which is ψ† σx ψ. Let's compute this.

σx is the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so ψ† is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*]. Since the coefficients are real, it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. 

So ψ† σx is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by σx. Wait, no, wait: (ψ†) is a row vector, and σx is a 2x2 matrix. So ψ† σx would be [ [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] ] multiplied by σx. Let me do that:

ψ† σx = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [ (0.5*0 + sqrt(3)/2 *1), (0.5*1 + sqrt(3)/2 *0) ) ] → [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

Now, multiply this by ψ, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T:

So [ sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ] + [0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ] → (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = same term added twice.

Each term is sqrt(3)/4, so the sum is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check that calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as (ψ† σx ψ) = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2)* (for the components where σx swaps the elements).

Wait no, perhaps it's easier to compute ψ† σx ψ directly as the sum over indices.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the sum over i,j of ψ_i^* (σx)_i,j ψ_j.

Since ψ is real, ψ_i^* is just ψ_i.

So:

⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(0)(0.5) + (0.5)(1)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(1)(0.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0)(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, no. Let me index it properly.

σx has elements:
σx(1,1) = 0,
σx(1,2) = 1,
σx(2,1)=1,
σx(2,2)=0.

So, for i=1 and j=1: ψ_1 * σx(1,1)*ψ_1 → 0.5 * 0 *0.5=0.
i=1, j=2: 0.5 *1 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4.
i=2, j=1: (sqrt(3)/2) *1 *0.5 = sqrt(3)/4.
i=2, j=2: (sqrt(3)/2)*0*(sqrt(3)/2) =0.

So the sum is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So that's about 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have confused the order of the states. Because when I write |↑⟩ as (1,0), then σx |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, right? So when calculating ψ† σx ψ, perhaps another approach would be better. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using the matrix method.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to write ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Then, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so ψ† (σx ψ) is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) )= 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = same as before, 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

So yeah, that confirms it. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

Now, putting it all together. The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5. 5*(0.8660) = approx 4.33. So total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(3) as approximately 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866025. So 5 times that is 5 * 0.866025 =4.330125.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. So -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. Because the next digit is 9, which rounds up: -0.669875 → -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check each step.

First, the coefficients: 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Squared, they give 0.25 and 0.75. So for σz, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the expectation is 0.25*(-1) +0.75*(-1)? Wait, no, wait. No, wait: no, wait a second! Wait, |↑⟩ is eigenstate of σz with eigenvalue +1, and |↓⟩ is -1. Oh wait no, wait that's correct. So 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) is 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. That's correct.

For σx, the calculation came to sqrt(3)/2. So 5 times that is about 4.33, but when we added to 10*(-0.5)=-5, we got -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is -0.7, which is correct.

I think that's right.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute it as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) of \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The coefficients of \( \psi \) are \( 0.5 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities are the squares of these coefficients:
\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) is written as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
To compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), we calculate:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi.
\]
First, compute \( \sigma_x \psi \):
\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) \):
\[
\psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) = [0.5, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}] \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, we get:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.
