Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get the details right.

Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, the problem also notes that we can ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution of the Galaxy, so I don't have to worry about those factors. That simplifies things a bit, I guess.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving relative velocity and possibly special relativity. Wait, but in the question, both frames are inertial, so maybe classical mechanics would work here? Or do I need to consider time dilation because of the high speeds involved? Because 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me think about that.

First, let's recall some basics. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is about 20% the speed of light. That's a significant speed, so relativistic effects might be noticeable. But wait, the question doesn't mention anything about time dilation or length contraction, so maybe they're expecting a solution using classical mechanics. But I'm not sure. I'll have to consider both possibilities.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says that the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center, and from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the two are approaching each other. But wait, velocities don't just add linearly in relativity. Oh, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, no. Let me think. If frame E (ejecta) sees the Galaxy moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards it, then in the Galaxy's frame (G), the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. Or is that correct? Because in relativity, when two objects are moving
