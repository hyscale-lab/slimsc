Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a go.

Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? Which is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, so 3.204 x 10^-19 C each.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So I imagine point P is the location of the 13th charge, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Hmm, but wait, how are they arranged? Like, are they all on the same sphere around P? Because if they're each 2 m from P, they might be on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right, in electrostatics, the energy of a system of charges is due to the potential energy between them. So I remember that the electric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for a system of n charges, each interacting with the others, the formula is a bit involved. Wait, but in this case, the setup is a bit specific. Let me think.

The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge. But what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other?

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So they're each 2 m from P, but their mutual distances depend on how they are arranged
