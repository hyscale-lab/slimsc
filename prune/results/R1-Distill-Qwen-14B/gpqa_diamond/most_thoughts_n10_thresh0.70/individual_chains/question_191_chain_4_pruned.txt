Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is. The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure.

So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2CHCH2 but with the double bond between C1 and C2, right? So, it's CH2-C(CH2)-? No, wait, the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but wait, wait. No, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, no. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, substituting at the 2 position, the prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2=C(CH2-). Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a substituent attached to the cyclohexane. So, the group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at the first carbon. Oh wait, no. The structure is (prop-1-en-2-yl) would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2 and the substituent on C2. So, it's like CH2=C-CH2-? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

The group is -CH2-C(=CH2)-. No, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C-CH2-, but attached to the cyclohexane at the middle carbon. So, it's CH2 attached to the cyclohexane, and then a double bond between the first and second carbons. So, the structure is (CH2)CH2 attached as a substituent, but with a double bond. So, it's a vinyl group attached with a methyl group? Hmm,
