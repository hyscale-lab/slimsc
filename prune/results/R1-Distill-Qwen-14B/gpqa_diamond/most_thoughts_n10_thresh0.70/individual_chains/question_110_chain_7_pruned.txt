Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including star characterization. 

The question gives me some details about each star's parameters, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments. Let's break down the problem.

First, I should understand the observing capabilities of each spectrograph. The user note says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, but wait—what's the exact cutoff? Because it says "brighter than 17 mag," which means apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is 17 or less, it's detectable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude less than or equal to 16.

Wait, no, wait again. The note says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, ESPRESSO's limit is V ≤ 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So anything with V less than 17 is okay. Similarly, HIRES can observe V ≤ 16.

So both spectrographs can observe the same star only if the star's apparent magnitude is ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. But wait, wait—also, ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So if a star is at V=16, both can observe it. If a star is V=17, only ESPRESSO can observe it. But for both, the star must be ≤16.

So the first step is to calculate the apparent V magnitude of each star and see which ones are ≤16 for both.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes and distance given. Others have apparent magnitudes. Oh, for Star3 and Star4, there's extinction (E(B-V)) which affects the apparent magnitude. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude
