Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the brightness of a star as seen from Earth is important. The question gives me some data about each star's apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude, and their distances. Oh wait, the key point is that each spectrograph can only observe stars brighter than a certain magnitude. For ESPRESSO, V magnitude brighter than 17, meaning apparent V mag <=17 because lower numbers are brighter. And HIRES can go down to 16, so apparent V mag <=16.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says 'brighter than 17 mag' for ESPRESSO. Wait, wait. Magnitude is a bit counterintuitive. Lower numbers mean brighter, higher numbers mean fainter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is 17, it's at the limit for ESPRESSO. So it can observe stars with V ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe V ≤16.

Wait, but the problem says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Does it mean that ESPRESSO can see stars that are brighter (i.e., magnitude less than 17) or fainter (more than 17)? Because the wording says "brighter than 17
