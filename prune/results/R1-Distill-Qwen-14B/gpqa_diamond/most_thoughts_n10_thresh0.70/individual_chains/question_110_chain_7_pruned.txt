Okay, so I’ve got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the question gives some key points about each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—brighter than 17? Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the more negative the magnitude, the brighter the object. So when they say "brighter than 17 mag," that means the apparent magnitude is less than 17 because lower numbers are brighter.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 is visible to HIRES. But wait, no—no, wait, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, meaning it can see stars that are up to 17 mag, right? Because "brighter" in magnitude terms is lower. So a star at 17 mag is the dimmest ESPRESSO can see. Wait, no, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"—so brighter than 17, meaning V mag less than 17. So any star with V less than 17 is visible by ESPRESSO, and any with V less than 1
