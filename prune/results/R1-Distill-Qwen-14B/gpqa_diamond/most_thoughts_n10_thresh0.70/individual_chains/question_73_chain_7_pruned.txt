Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m and are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The questions are about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D with different values.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativity of velocity. The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c^2)), but wait, that's when you're finding the velocity of one frame from another. Wait, no, in this case, each astronaut is moving at a certain speed, but from whose perspective are we calculating the relative speed?

Wait, the problem says the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. So I think the relative speed would be how fast one is moving relative to the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's frame, B is moving at 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? But wait, no. Because in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like that. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, the formula is for when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So if I want the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, I think that's the case. So let me denote u as the velocity of B in the lab frame, and v as the velocity of A in the lab frame. So u is 0.5c, v is 0.6c. Wait, wait no: no, wait. Let me get this right. If in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B's velocity is (u' = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/c²)).

Wait, I think the formula is (u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make sure. Oh wait
