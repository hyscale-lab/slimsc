Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can figure it out step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN^- ligands attached. So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that. But wait, the β values are given as β1, β2, etc. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on.

Stability constants are for the formation of the complexes. So the general reaction is Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), and βn is the formation constant for that complex.

So the possible complexes are:
- Co^2+ (n=0)
- Co(SCN)^+ (n=1)
- Co(SCN)_2 (n=2)
- Co(SCN)_3^- (n=3)
- Co(SCN)_4^2- (n=4)

Wait, but the problem is asking about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex. So β2 is 40.

But wait, the question mentions β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. That's interesting because usually, higher β means more stable. Hmm, so the Co(SCN)_3^- complex has a higher stability constant (β3=63) than Co(SCN)_4^2- (β4=16). So the trithiocyanato complex is more stable than the tetra.

Wait, but the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex. So I need to find the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 in the solution.

But how do I approach this? I think this involves the distribution of cobalt species based on the
