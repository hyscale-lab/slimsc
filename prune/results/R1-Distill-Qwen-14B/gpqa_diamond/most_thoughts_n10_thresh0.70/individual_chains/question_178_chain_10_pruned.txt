Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ and determining if the theory is renormalizable. Let me break it down.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices are related to the generators of Lorentz transformations, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

First, I think I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should recall how to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since the action is dimensionless). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because the integral over four dimensions (d^4x) has mass dimension -4 (since each derivative is mass dimension 1, and each coordinate x has dimension -1, so four coordinates give -4, and the integral's measure contributes -4; the integrand needs to be 4 to make the action dimensionless).

Wait, no. Wait, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because [Action] is dimensionless, and Action is ∫ L d^4x. Since each d^4x has dimension -4, the integrand L must have dimension 4, because 4 -4 =0 for action. So each term in L must have dimension 4.

So, looking at L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's find the dimensions of each part.

First, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a Dirac field, the kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. Each derivative is dimension 1, each ψ is (3/2), so the term is (3/2) + 1 + (3/2) = 5/2 +1? Wait, maybe I should think again. The term i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ is part of the Lagrangian, so the whole term must have dimension 4. So ψ̄ i γ ∂ ψ must have dimension 4. ψ̄ is same as ψ*, so it's also dimension 3/2. So (3/2) + (3/2) + (∂, which is 1) -> 3/2 *2 =3, plus 1=4. So each ψ has dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ σ ψ: each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3/2 + 3/2 =3. But wait, σ_{mu nu} is a tensor made from gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless because it's constructed from gamma matrices which are dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension
