Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, right. So, I think this is about electric potential energy. Because when you have charges in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy, and we're looking for the minimum energy. But wait, how do I approach this?

So, the setup is that one charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Since all the charges are identical, each has charge 2e. Oh, wait, so each is 2 times the elementary charge, which is 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. Let me note that down: q = 2e = 3.2e-19 C.

Now, for the potential energy in a system of charges. I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But since they all are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe there's a simpler way to calculate this.

Wait, the potential energy U for a system of multiple point charges can be calculated using the formula: U = (1/(4πε₀)) * Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij), where the sum is over all pairs i < j. But since all the charges are the same, and the distances are the same between each moving charge and the fixed one, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula that applies here.

Wait, the fixed charge is at P. So each of the 12 charges at 2 meters away interacts with the fixed charge. Additionally, each of the 12 charges also interacts with the other 11 charges. So the total potential energy will have two parts: the energy due to the fixed charge and each moving charge, and the energy due to the interactions among the moving charges themselves.

But wait, because the moving charges are constrained, perhaps we don't have to consider their mutual repulsion? Or do we? Hmm, no, because each moving charge is at the same distance from P, and each is the same distance from each other. Wait, no, wait, if all 12 are at 2 meters from P, but are they arranged in a way that their mutual distances are the same as each other? For example, if they're equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 meters, then each moving charge is at a distance from the others that is the same? Or not?

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the arrangement of the 12 charges around P. So perhaps it's a simplified scenario where the only interactions considered are each moving charge with the fixed charge at P. Because if their mutual distances are the same as the fixed charge, but in reality, the mutual distances between the moving charges would depend on their arrangement. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's assuming that the moving charges are so far apart that their mutual interactions can be neglected. Or maybe it's considering only the energy between each moving charge and the fixed charge.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the 12 charges are all at the same point? No, they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, which is a sphere of radius 2 meters. So they must be points on a sphere. But their mutual distances would vary depending on how they're placed. Without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute their mutual potential energies. So perhaps the problem is simplifying and only considering the potential energy between each moving charge and the fixed charge, not the interactions among the moving charges themselves. Because without knowing their arrangement, we can't calculate that part. Hmm, that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that all the moving charges are at the same point, but that's impossible because they would repel each other. So they must be arranged in some way on the sphere. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the other terms are negligible or the problem is only considering the energy between the 12 moving charges and the fixed one.

Wait, the problem says the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. But given that the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps arranging them all on the same line as P might not be the case because that would cause maximum repulsion. Wait, no. Wait, the potential energy is a measure of work done against the field. So when you bring each charge closer, the potential energy increases or decreases?

Wait, no. Let me think. Each moving charge is brought from infinity to a point at 2m from P. The fixed charge at P is 2e. Each moving charge is 2e as well. So the potential energy of each moving charge relative to the fixed one would be (k * q * Q)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q and Q are the charges, and r is the distance.

But since all 12 are being brought in, the total potential energy would be the sum of each of their interactions with the fixed charge. But wait, each moving charge interacts with the fixed charge, but not necessarily with each other because perhaps they're arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are much larger than 2 meters. But the problem doesn't specify. So maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each moving charge and the fixed one, and not the mutual energies among the moving charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the moving charges to be placed in such a way that their mutual distances are the same as the distance from the fixed charge. But that's only possible if they are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, but without that information, it's unclear.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Hmm, so perhaps to minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves as close as possible. But wait, since they are all positive charges (because 2e is positive), they repel each other. So the minimum energy would be when they are as far apart as possible? Or is that the other way around?

Wait, wait, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive because they repel. So bringing them closer would require work, increasing the potential energy. So to minimize the potential energy, the charges should be as far apart as possible, but in this case, they are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So their mutual distances can't be more than 4 meters (if they're diametrically opposite on the sphere), but that's probably not the case for all. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 moving charges. So the total potential energy U is 12 times the energy between each pair (fixed and moving). Because each moving charge is at 2 meters from P, and the charges are 2e each.

So each pair would contribute (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r. Since r is 2 meters, each term would be (k * (2e)^2)/2.

So the total energy from these interactions would be 12 * (k*(4e²)/2) = 12 * (2 k e²) = 24 k e².

But wait, wait a minute. Wait, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is (k q1 q2)/r. Since each is 2e, it's (k (2e)(2e))/r = (4 k e²)/r. So each pair contributes 4 k e² / r.

So for each of the 12 moving charges, the energy is (4k e²) / 2 m. So each contributes 2 k e². So 12 of them would give 24 k e².

But wait, in a system with multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum over all pairs. So in this case, the fixed charge (at P) interacts with each of the 12 moving charges. So that's 12 pairs. Each contributes (k q1 q2)/r.

But what about the potential energy between the moving charges themselves? Each moving charge is at 2 meters from P, but what's their distance from each other? If they're on a sphere, the minimum distance between any two would be 2 meters (if they're at the same point, but that's impossible). Wait, but that's not feasible because they're all on the sphere of radius 2 meters. The minimum distance between any two points on a sphere of radius r is 0 (if they coincide), but that's not possible due to repulsion. Or maximum when they are at opposite ends, 4 meters apart.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem is considering that the moving charges are so many that their mutual distances can't be controlled, and it's too complex. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and each moving charge, and not the moving charges' mutual energies. Because otherwise, the problem would have given more information about their arrangement.

Wait, but the options are given. Let me compute the value for the case where we only consider the fixed charge and the moving charges.

So, U = 12 * [k (2e)(2e) / 2 m ].

Let me plug in the numbers.

k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e is 1.6e-19 C.

So, 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

Each term is (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each part:

(2e) * (2e) = 4e² = 4*(1.6e-19)^2 = 4*(2.56e-38) = 1.024e-37 C².

Wait, but in the formula, it's (k * (2e) * (2e) ) / r. So:

k * (4e²) / r.

So for each pair, it's 8.988e9 * (4 * (1.6e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

4e² = 4 * 2.56e-38 = 1.024e-37 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = ?

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37:

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

1.024e-37 = 1.024 * 1e-37.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 * 1.024 ≈ let's compute that.

8.988 * 1 = 8.988, 8.988 * 0.024 ≈ 0.2157. So total ≈ 9.2037.

Multiply exponents: 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28.

So 9.2037e-28.

Now, divide by r=2 meters.

So 9.2037e-28 / 2 = 4.60185e-28 J per pair.

But wait, each moving charge contributes this, and there are 12 moving charges. So total U is 12 * 4.60185e-28.

12 * 4.60185e-28 = ?

Let me compute 4.60185 *12.

4 *12=48, 0.60185 *12≈7.222. So total ≈55.222.

So 55.222e-28 J. Which is 5.5222e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, that's 5.5222e-27 J. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about twice that. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.

Each moving charge is 2e, fixed is 2e, r is 2 m.

Each pair's potential energy is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r.

Which is (k *4 e²)/r.

So for each of the 12, U_i = (4 k e²)/ (2) = 2 k e².

So 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, 24 k e².

Let me compute that.

24 * k * e².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So, 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 * 8.988e9 = let's see: 8.988e9 *24 = 8.988 *24= 215.712, so 215.712e9 = 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.56e-38: 2.15712e11 * 2.56e-38 = (2.15712 *2.56) * 1e-27.

2.15712 *2.56: Let me compute.

2 * 2.56 =5.12.

0.15712 *2.56≈ 0.4023. So total ≈5.12 +0.4023=5.5223.

So 5.5223e-27 J.

Same as before. So the energy is approximately 5.522e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.276 times higher. Hmm, but that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I missed a factor. Because when calculating potential energy for multiple charges, sometimes you have to consider that each pair is counted once. Oh wait, in this case, each moving charge interacts with the fixed charge once. So if there are 12 moving charges, each contributes a pair. So 12 pairs, right? Because the fixed charge is only one, so each moving charge is a separate pair.

So I think that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all pairs, including the moving charges among themselves. That's a different calculation.

Wait, but without knowing the arrangement, how can I compute the mutual potential energy of the 12 moving charges?

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the moving charges are all very far apart from each other, so their mutual potential energies are negligible. But that might not be the case if they're all at the same radius.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the distance between any two is much larger than 2 meters, their mutual potential energies would be small. But if they are on a sphere of radius 2 meters, the distance between two adjacent charges could be less than 2 meters times 2, which would be 4 meters. But for 12 charges, the angle between them on the sphere would be about 30 degrees, maybe, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the fixed charge and each moving charge, and not the mutual interactions. So in that case, the calculation I did earlier gives about 5.52e-27 J.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times higher. Hmm, maybe I messed up an exponent.

Wait, let me re-examine my calculations.

Each term is (k * (2e)^2) / r → (8.988e9) * (4e^2) / 2.

e is 1.6e-19, so e^2 is 2.56e-38.

4e^2 is 1.024e-37.

Wait, so 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = ?

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

1.024e-37 = 1.024 * 1e-37.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 * 1.024 ≈ 9.201.

Multiply 1e9 * 1e-37 = 1e-28.

So 9.201e-28.

Divide by 2 (r=2 m): 4.6005e-28.

Multiply by 12 (12 moving charges):

4.6005e-28 *12 =55.206e-28 =5.5206e-27 J.

So that's approximately 5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 7.056e-27, but that's higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their position. So each moving charge contributes (k * Q * q)/r, where Q is the fixed charge and q is the moving charge.

So for each moving charge, the energy added is (k * 2e * 2e) / 2 m.

Which is (k *4 e²) /2 = 2 k e².

12 charges: 24 k e².

So 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.6e-19)^2 is 2.56e-38, and 24 *8.988e9 is 215.712e9.

Wait, 215.712e9 * 2.56e-38 = (215.712 * 2.56) * 1e-29.

215.712 * 2.56: let's compute.

200 *2.56=512.

15.712 *2.56≈15*2.56=38.4, 0.712 *2.56≈1.82. So total ≈ 38.4 +1.82=40.22.

So 512 +40.22=552.22.

So 552.22e-29 =5.5222e-27 J.

Same as before.

So why is there no option matching this? The options are:

A) 5.645e-26 → about 55 times larger.

B) 2.822e-26 → about 51 times larger.

C) 7.056e-27 → about 1.28 times larger.

D) 122.330 → way larger.

Hmm, so my calculation is about 5.52e-27, but option C is 7.05e-27, which is about 1.28 times bigger. So maybe I made a mistake, perhaps the charges are 12e instead of 2e each?

Wait, the question says each has charge 2e. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for the potential energy between the moving charges themselves. So the total energy would be the sum of the fixed-moving charges and the moving-moving charges.

But without knowing how the moving charges are arranged, it's impossible to calculate the latter. So perhaps the problem is considering that the moving charges are so far apart that their mutual potential energies are negligible compared to the fixed-moving terms. But in that case, 5.5e-27 J is about option C but about 1.28 times larger.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I forgot to multiply by the Coulomb's constant correctly. Let me double-check Coulomb's constant. Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, the fixed charge is one, and the moving charges are 12. So the number of fixed-moving pairs is 12.

But for the moving-moving pairs, each pair is counted once. So the number of moving-moving pairs is (12 *11)/2 =66 pairs. But without knowing the distances between the moving charges, I can't compute their contribution. So perhaps the problem is not considering this, and only the fixed-moving interactions are considered.

So, given that, the calculated energy is about 5.52e-27 J. But none of the options match except perhaps option C, but it's 7e-27, which is higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done to bring each charge from infinity, and each time the existing charges contribute to the potential. So when you bring the first charge, the potential at P is (k Q)/r where Q is the fixed charge. Wait, but the fixed charge is already there. Hmm, but no, because the fixed charge is fixed, and the moving charges are being brought in. So the potential at 2 meters from P due to the fixed charge is (k * 2e)/ (2 m) = k e / m.

Wait, each moving charge is brought from infinity to 2 m. The potential at 2 m is due to the fixed charge and the previously placed moving charges. But this complicates the calculation because each new charge added increases the potential at 2 m, affecting the work needed for the next charges.

Oh! Wait, this is a crucial point. Because when you add each charge, the potential at 2 m is due to all the previously placed charges. So the potential energy calculation for the entire system is more involved.

So, the formula for the total potential energy is the sum over all pairs, but when considering the work done to bring each charge in, you have to account for all the charges already present.

So, the correct approach is to calculate the potential energy as the sum over each charge of (q) multiplied by the potential at its position due to all the other charges.

In this case, the fixed charge at P is 2e. The moving charges are each 2e, brought in one by one.

Each moving charge is at 2 m from P, and the fixed charge contributes to the potential at their position.

But when bringing the first moving charge, the potential at 2m is due only to the fixed charge: V = (k * 2e)/2 = k e.

The work done to bring the first moving charge is q * V = (2e) * (k e) = 2 k e².

Now, when bringing the second moving charge, the potential at 2m is due to the fixed charge (k *2e /2 = k e) and the first moving charge (k *2e / 2 = k e).

So the potential is V = k e + k e = 2 k e.

The work done is (2e) * 2 k e =4 k e².

Wait, no. Wait, when you bring the second moving charge, the potential at 2m is from the fixed charge (k*(2e)/2) and the first moving charge (k*(2e)/2). So V = (k*2e/2) + (k*2e/2) )= k e + k e = 2 k e.

So the work done is q * V = 2e * 2 k e = 4 k e².

Similarly, for the third moving charge, the potential at 2m is from the fixed charge (k e) plus the two already placed moving charges (each contributes k e). So V = k e + 2 * (k e) =3 k e. So work done is 2e *3 k e =6 k e².

Proceeding in this way, each new moving charge contributes (n) * (k e), where n is the number of moving charges already present plus 1 (the fixed charge). Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, each moving charge when brought in experiences a potential due to the fixed charge (2e at 2m: V_fixed = (k *2e)/2 =k e) and the potential due to all previously placed moving charges.

So when the i-th moving charge is brought in, the potential at its position is V = k e (from fixed) + sum_{j=1 to i-1} (k * 2e)/2.

Because each of the j charges is at 2m from P, so their potential at 2m is (k * 2e)/2 =k e per charge.

So for the i-th charge:

V_i = k e + (i-1) *k e =k e (1 + i-1) )= k e i.

Wait, no. When you bring the first charge in, the potential is V1 = k e (from fixed). The work done is 2e * k e = 2 k e².

When bringing the second charge, the potential is V2 = k e (fixed) + 1 * k e (from first moving charge) )= 2 k e. Work done: 2e * 2 k e =4 k e².

Third charge: V3 =k e + 2 k e =3k e. Work done: 2e *3 k e=6 k e².

So for each charge, the work done is 2e * (i) k e, where i is the number of charges already present plus the fixed charge's contribution. Wait, no. Wait, the fixed charge contributes a constant V of k e. Each previous moving charge contributes another k e. So for the nth moving charge, the potential is V =k e (fixed) + (n-1)*k e (moving charges) )=k e (1 +n -1) )=k e n.

So the work done for each charge is 2e * (k e n).

So the total work for all 12 charges is the sum from n=1 to 12 of 2e * k e *n.

Which is 2 k e² * sum_{n=1}^{12} n.

Sum from 1 to 12 is (12*13)/2=78.

So total U = 2 k e² *78 = 156 k e².

So let's compute that.

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.6e-19 C.

So,

156 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute step by step:

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38 C².

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = ?

8.988e9 =8.988 *1e9.

2.56e-38=2.56 *1e-38.

Multiply: 8.988 *2.56 ≈23.08 (because 8*2.56=20.48, 0.988 *2.56≈2.53, total ~23.01).

1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So 23.01e-29.

Multiply by 156:

23.01e-29 *156 = ?

23.01 *156 = let's compute.

20 *156 =3120.

3.01 *156 = 468. 56.

So total 3120 +468.56=3588.56.

So 3588.56e-29 =3.58856e-26 J.

Wait, that's 3.588e-26 J.

Looking at the options:

A)5.645e-26 → about 5.6e-26.

B)2.822e-26 → about 2.8e-26.

C)7.056e-27 →0.7e-26.

D)122.330 → way larger.

So our new result is about 3.588e-26 J. Which is not exactly matching any option, but option B is 2.822e-26, which is close but a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute 23.01e-29 *156.

Wait, 23.01 *156:

23 *156= 23*(150+6)=23*150=3450 +23*6=138 →3450+138=3588.

0.01 *156=1.56.

So 3588+1.56=3589.56.

So 3589.56e-29 =3.58956e-26 J.

So approximately 3.59e-26 J.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. The closest is option A:5.645e-26, which is about 5.6e-26, which is about 1.56 times higher than my value.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the approach. Because when you bring the charges in, the potential due to all other charges (fixed and moving) must be considered. So the correct approach is to compute the potential at each step when adding a charge, considering all prior charges.

Another approach is to calculate the total potential energy as the sum over all pairs. So for the fixed charge and each moving charge, and for each pair of moving charges.

So U = U_fixed_moving + U_moving_moving.

We calculated U_fixed_moving as 12 * (k (2e)(2e))/2 = 24 k e².

U_moving_moving is the sum over all pairs of moving charges, each pair contributing (k (2e)(2e))/r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, the distance between moving charges, we can't compute this. So perhaps the problem is only asking for U_fixed_moving, which is 24 k e²=5.52e-27 J. But that doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all moving charges are at the same point, which is impossible, but that would make the potential energy among themselves to be (12 choose 2) * (k (2e)(2e))/r, where r is 0, which is infinite. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the moving charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge, but their mutual distances are negligible. But that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial approach without considering the moving-moving interactions.

So U_fixed_moving=5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times higher than my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of e. Let me confirm: e=1.602e-19 C. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let's try that.

So, using k=9e9.

Then, U_fixed_moving=12 * (9e9 *4e²)/(2).

Wait, (9e9) * (4e²)/2.

Wait, 4e² is 4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*(2.56e-38)=1.024e-37.

Then, 9e9 *1.024e-37 =9.216e-28.

Divide by 2:4.608e-28.

Multiply by 12: 55.296e-28=5.5296e-27 J.

Still about 5.53e-27. No, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each moving charge is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge, and also each moving charge is at a distance of 2 meters from each other. That would be a very peculiar arrangement, perhaps in a regular dodecahedron, but is that possible?

Wait, but 12 charges arranged on a sphere such that each is 2 meters from each other as well would require a specific geometry. Let's compute r_ij in that case, for a regular dodecahedron.

Wait, no, a regular dodecahedron has 20 vertices. Maybe a different polyhedron.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cube, but 12 charges can't form a cube (which has 8 vertices). Maybe they're arranged in a different way.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem is designed to ignore the moving-moving interactions, and only consider the fixed-moving interactions. So the answer is approximately 5.52e-27 J, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is in error, but given the options, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the charges are 12e each. No, the question says each has charge 2e.

Wait, another thing: the question says "minimum energy". So perhaps the system's energy is minimized when the moving charges are placed as far away as possible, which would lower the potential energy. But given that they are constrained to stay at 2 meters, maybe the minimum energy is when the moving charges are as far apart as possible. But again, without knowing the arrangement, I can't calculate that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the moving charges are all at the same point, but that would make their mutual potential energy very high, which would increase the total energy. But the problem is looking for minimum energy, which would mean the charges are as far apart as possible.

Wait, in that case, perhaps the moving charges are placed on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 meters, and the distances between them are as large as possible, which would minimize the mutual repulsion and thus the potential energy.

But again, without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the fixed-moving interactions, and thus the answer is about 5.52e-27 J. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5 times higher than 5.52e-27.

Wait, 5.52e-27 * 5=2.76e-26, which is close to option B's 2.822e-26.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each moving charge is interacting with the fixed charge, and each moving charge also interacts with the other moving charges, which are themselves 2 meters away. But then, how many pairs are there?

The U_fixed_moving is 12 * (k (2e)^2)/2 = 24 k e².

The U_moving_moving is (12 choose 2) * (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

But what is r_ij? If all moving charges are on a sphere of radius 2 meters, the distance between any two is at least 0 (but not possible due to repulsion), but let's assume they're arranged so that each is at a distance of 2 meters from each other. That's impossible unless they're all at the same point, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps the moving charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron around the fixed charge, each at 2 meters from P. The edge length of a regular dodecahedron is different, but perhaps in this case, the distance between two adjacent moving charges is also 2 meters.

Wait, no, that's not possible for a regular dodecahedron. The edge length would be a certain value, but the radius of the circumscribed sphere is different.

But perhaps the problem simplifies r_ij to 2 meters as well, which is not physically possible for 12 charges, but maybe it's an approximation.

In that case, U_moving_moving = (12 choose 2) * (k*(2e)^2)/2.

(12 choose 2) is 66 pairs.

So U_moving_moving =66 * (k*(4e²)/2) =66 * 2 k e².

So 66 *2=132. So U_moving_moving=132 k e².

U_total= U_fixed_moving + U_moving_moving =24 k e² +132 k e²=156 k e².

Which is the same as the previous approach when considering the work done step by step. So that gives 156 k e².

Which we computed as approximately 3.58e-26 J.

But this doesn't match any option. So perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the fixed-moving interactions, giving about 5.52e-27 J, which is not an option, but perhaps the options have a typo.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Hmm, that's about 1.276 times larger than 5.52e-27.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to sum all pairs, including fixed-moving and moving-moving.

So U_total= U_fixed_moving + U_moving_moving.

U_fixed_moving=12 * (k*(2e)^2)/2=24 k e².

U_moving_moving= (12*11/2) * (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

But what is r_ij? If each moving charge is 2 meters from P, and each is also 2 meters from each other, which is impossible, but perhaps the problem assumes that each moving charge is at a distance of 2 meters from every other moving charge. But that can't be, as you can't have 12 points all separated by 2 meters on a sphere of radius 2 meters. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the moving charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are negligible, or that their mutual potential energy is zero.

Wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the moving charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the fixed-moving interactions, and the moving-moving interactions are not considered, perhaps due to being negligible or the problem's simplification.

But given that, the calculated U is about 5.52e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the charges are all positive, so bringing them closer increases the potential energy. To find the minimum energy, perhaps we need to arrange the charges as far apart as possible, but since they're constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, their mutual distances would be at least 4 meters (if opposite ends of the sphere). So the mutual potential energy would be as small as possible, thus minimizing the total energy.

Wait, wait, but potential energy between two positive charges is positive and increases with decreasing distance. So to minimize the total potential energy, you want the charges to be as far apart as possible. So arranging the moving charges as far apart as possible would result in the least mutual potential energy.

But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem simplifies and ignores the moving-moving terms, assuming they're negligible.

In that case, the total energy is 5.52e-27 J, which is not an option. So perhaps the problem is not considering the moving-moving terms, and the correct answer is 5.52e-27 J. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is (5.52e-27) * (1.276). Where does 1.276 come from? Maybe a calculation mistake in the number of charges.

Wait, perhaps the problem states 12 charges, but I considered 12. Alternatively, perhaps I should use 13 charges, but one is fixed. So the moving charges are 12, which I did.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute 156 k e² again.

k=8.988e9.

e=1.6e-19.

So 156 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

8.988e9 *2.56e-38 = 8.988 *2.56 =23.01, and exponents 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29. So 23.01e-29.

Multiply by 156: 23.01 *156 =3588.56. So 3588.56e-29 =3.58856e-26 J.

But option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 0.8 *3.58e-26.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me recount.

In the approach where each moving charge is brought in and the potential due to all previous charges is considered, the total U is sum_{n=1}^{12} 2e * V_n.

V_n for the nth charge is k e (fixed) + (n-1)*k e (from moving charges).

So V_n =k e (1 +n-1) =k e n.

So each term is 2e *k e n = 2 k e² n.

Sum from n=1 to 12: sum n=78.

So total U=2 k e² *78=156 k e².

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used 6.0e-36 instead of (1.6e-19)^2?

No, because (1.6e-19)^2 is 2.56e-38, which is correct.

Hmm, I'm not seeing any mistake in the calculation. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses charge e instead of 2e. Let me check the question again.

No, the question says each charge has 2e. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses charge magnitude e, not 2e. Let me recalculate with e.

So if each charge is e, then U_fixed_moving=12*(k e^2)/2=6 k e².

Which would be 6 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute that: 6 *8.988e9=53.928e9.

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

So 53.928e9 *2.56e-38 =53.928 *2.56=138.087, exponents 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29.

So 138.087e-29=1.38087e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 5 times higher. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but based on the calculation, the closest is option C but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to only consider the fixed-moving pairs, giving 5.52e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each moving charge is at a distance of 2 meters from each other as well as the fixed charge. So each moving charge is 2 meters from the fixed charge and 2 meters from each other. That would make the mutual distances 2 meters, but that's impossible for 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2 m. So perhaps the problem is making an approximation, and the mutual potential energy is (12 choose 2) * (k (2e)^2)/2.

So U_moving_moving=66 * (k (4e²) )/2 =66 * 2 k e²=132 k e².

Then, U_total=24 k e² +132 k e²=156 k e²=3.59e-26 J.

But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the moving charges are arranged in a straight line at 2 meters from P, but that would mean their mutual distances are 4 meters apart, depending on their positions. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the fixed charge and one moving charge, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum potential energy, which would be when the moving charges are as far apart as possible, thus minimizing their mutual repulsion. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem expects you to only consider the fixed-moving interactions.

In that case, the answer would be 5.52e-27 J, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure how that arises. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the fixed-moving calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 24 k e².

24 *8.988e9=215.712e9.

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

So 215.712e9 *2.56e-38 = (215.712 *2.56) *1e-29.

215.712 *2.56: 200*2.56=512, 15.712*2.56≈40.3.

Total ≈552.3, so 552.3e-29=5.523e-27 J.

Which is about 5.52e-27 J.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26. Wait, 5.52e-27 is approximately half of option B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each moving charge is at a distance of 1 meter from P. Let me check the question again.

No, the question says 2 meters from P.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the charges are electrons with charge -2e, but that wouldn't change the potential energy calculation since it's based on the product of charges.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a calculation mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let me recompute 24 k e².

24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9=2.15712e11.

Multiply by e²=2.56e-38.

So 2.15712e11 *2.56e-38= (2.15712*2.56) *1e-27.

2.15712 *2.56: 2 *2.56=5.12, 0.15712 *2.56≈0.4023. So 5.12+0.4023=5.5223.

So 5.5223e-27 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be approximately 5.52e-27 J. But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27. But I'm not seeing how that arises.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me check: Coulomb's constant k=1/(4πε₀)=8.988e9 N·m²/C². Yes, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition, such as using (1/(4πε₀)) as k, which is what I did.

Hmm... I'm stuck. Based on the calculation, the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps option B is the intended one if for some reason the number of pairs is considered differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should select option B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses (k = 9e9) and charge e, not 2e. Let me compute that.

If charge is e:

U_fixed_moving=12 * (9e9 * e^2)/2.

e=1.6e-19.

So 12 *9e9 * (2.56e-38)/2.

=12 *9e9 *1.28e-38.

12 *9=108.

108 *1.28e-29=138.24e-29=1.3824e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps the correct approach is to only consider the fixed-moving interactions, giving 5.52e-27 J. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use a different approach, leading to option B.

But I'm not seeing a clear path. Based on the calculations, the closest to any option is option C, but it's not matching precisely.


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \). The energy of the system arises from the interactions between the fixed charge and the moving charges, as well as the mutual interactions among the moving charges. However, the problem does not specify the arrangement of the moving charges, making it difficult to account for their mutual interactions definitively.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fixed-Moving Charge Interactions**:
   - Each moving charge interacts with the fixed charge at \( P \). The potential energy for each pair is given by:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-moving}} = \frac{k (2e)(2e)}{r} = \frac{4 k e^2}{r}
     \]
     where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - For each moving charge, the energy is:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-moving, per charge}} = \frac{4 k e^2}{2} = 2 k e^2
     \]
   - With 12 moving charges, the total energy from these interactions is:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-moving, total}} = 12 \cdot 2 k e^2 = 24 k e^2
     \]

2. **Moving-Moving Charge Interactions**:
   - The mutual potential energy between the moving charges depends on their arrangement. Without explicit information about their positions, it is challenging to compute this term. If the problem assumes that the moving charges are far apart or their mutual interactions are negligible, this term can be ignored.

3. **Calculation of \( U_{\text{fixed-moving, total}} \)**:
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-moving, total}} = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2
     \]
     - Compute \( e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \).
     - Compute \( k \cdot e^2 = 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38} = 2.301 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{C} \).
     - Multiply by 24:
       \[
       U_{\text{fixed-moving, total}} = 24 \cdot 2.301 \times 10^{-28} = 5.522 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
       \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated energy \( 5.522 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the given options exactly.
   - Option \( C \) (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)) is approximately 1.28 times larger than the calculated value, suggesting a possible discrepancy in the problem setup or assumptions.
   - Option \( B \) (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)) is significantly larger and does not align with the calculations.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent result based on the problem's assumptions and calculations is \( 5.522 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). However, since this value does not match any option, the closest possible answer is \( C \), despite the discrepancy.

Answer: C
