Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on 1/plx.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I think parallax is related to distance. Right, the parallax of a star is the reciprocal of its distance. So a star with a parallax plx has a distance d = 1/plx. But how does that tie into the number of stars in a given range of parallax?

So, if stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Oh, right, so the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But I'm not tracking how parallax plays into that.

Let me think about the distribution. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So as plx increases, the star is closer, and as plx decreases, the star is farther away. Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, for a given change in plx (delta plx), how many stars are there?

Wait, the number per unit plx. I think I need to model this with some math. Let's define N as the number of stars in a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx. Or perhaps, more precisely, the number per unit plx is the derivative of N with respect to plx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density n is a constant. So, the number of stars in a volume is n multiplied by the volume.

But how is the volume related to parallax? Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd = -d^2 dplx. (Wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So, maybe I should use plx as the variable instead of d.)

Let me substitute d with 1/plx. So, d = 1/plx, dd = (d/d plx)(1/plx) ) = -1/(plx²) dplx.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to relate the volume element in terms of plx. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πd² dd. But since dd is related to dplx, I need to express this in terms of plx.

Given that d = 1/plx, then dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering a positive shell thickness, maybe I can take the absolute value, so dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into the volume element:

Volume = 4πd² dd =4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right.
