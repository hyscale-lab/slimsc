Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 over the parallax in arcseconds. So if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the question is about the number density of stars per unit parallax. Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, so their actual number per unit volume in space should be constant. But how does that translate to parallax?

Let me think in terms of a volume element. In three dimensions, the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if I consider a thin shell at a distance r with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is approximately 4πr² dr. 

Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So N(r) dr = n * 4πr² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume). 

But wait, the question is about parallax, not distance. Parallax plx is 1/r, so r = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So r = 1/plx, and dr would be the change in r for a small change in plx. Let's see, dr = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. Because if plx increases, r decreases. Oh right, so dplx is positive when plx increases, but r decreases, hence the negative sign. But I'm looking at the absolute value here.

So the volume element in terms of parallax would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2 dplx)) )? Wait, let me double-check that. 

Because r = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. To make it positive, I can write dr = (1/(plx^2)) (-dplx), but since dplx is the change, maybe I can just take the absolute value. So dr ≈ (1/plx^2)
