Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is big, the star is nearby. The formula I know is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx. But how does that relate here?

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me rewrite that. N ∝ (plx)^-5. Since plx = 1/d, that would mean plx = 1/r, assuming r is the distance. So replacing plx in the equation, N ∝ (1/r)^-5. Wait, that's (r^-1)^-5 = r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me check that again. Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5=1/d^5. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as the distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

But wait, wait. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So that's N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx is 1/d, 1/plx is d. So N = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, I think that refers to the number density, like the number per unit volume? Or maybe the number per unit distance, but that's not exactly right. Let me think.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So perhaps they're asking about the differential number of stars,
