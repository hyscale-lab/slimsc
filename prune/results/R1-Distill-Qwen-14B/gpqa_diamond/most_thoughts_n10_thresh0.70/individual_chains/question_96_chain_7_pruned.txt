Okay, so I need to find the entropy of a supermassive black hole based on the given angular size of its event horizon. Hmm, let me think about what I remember regarding black holes and entropy.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as S = (k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G) multiplied by the area, which makes sense because the area A is involved.

So, A is the area of the event horizon. For a black hole, the event horizon is a sphere, so the area should be 4πr², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But wait, how do I find r from the given data?

The problem gives me the angular size θ as 10^-17 degrees. Angular size θ is related to the actual size (like the diameter of the event horizon) and the distance d to the object. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ (size)/(distance), but I think this is an approximation when θ is small, which it definitely is here.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is θ (in radians) ≈ (diameter of the object) / (distance). So, if the event horizon has radius r, then the diameter is 2r. So, θ ≈ (2r)/d. But since θ is given in degrees, I need to convert that to radians first.

Let me write this down. θ (radians) ≈ (2r) / d. So, solving for r: r ≈ (θ_rad * d)/2.

But wait, θ is given as 10^-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = 10^-17 * (π/180) ≈ roughly 1.745e-19 radians, because 1 degree is about 0.01745 radians. Let me compute that more precisely: 10^-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, what's a parsec in meters? I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So now, plugging into the formula: r ≈ (θ_rad * d) / 2. Let's compute that.

r ≈ (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2.

Calculating that numerator: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 ≈ (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7 (since 1e-19 *1e26 is 1e7). Let's compute 1.745 * 3.086. Hmm, 1.7 *3 is about 5.1, so roughly 5.39? Let's see: 3.086 * 1.745:

3 * 1.745 = 5.235, 0.086 *1.745 ≈ ~0.150. So total is approx 5.385. So 5.385e7 meters. Then divide by 2: 5.385e7 /2 ≈ 2.6925e7 meters.

Wait, so r is about 2.7e7 meters. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m. Multiply by θ_rad of 1.745e-19: 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = (3.086 * 1.745) * 1e7. 3.086 *1.745 is approximately 3 *1.745=5.235, plus 0.086 *1.745= ~0.150. So 5.385. So 5.385e7. Then divide by 2 gives r ≈ 2.69e7 meters. So about 2.7e7 meters.

But wait, that seems a bit big. Wait, for a supermassive black hole, the Schwarzschild radius is usually on the scale of millions of kilometers or something, but 2.7e7 meters is 27,000 km. Let me think. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad: 3.086e26 * 1e-19 is 3.086e7. Multiply by 1.745: 3.086e7 *1.745 ≈ (3 *1.745)e7 ≈ 5.235e7. Then divide by 2: 2.6175e7 m. So about 2.6e7 m, which is 26,000 km. Hmm, seems okay for a supermassive black hole. Because, for example, the Schwarzschild radius is roughly 3 km per solar mass. So a black hole with R ~26,000 km would have a mass of about (26,000 km) / (3 km per solar mass) = ~8,666 solar masses. But that's a bit low for a supermassive black hole. Wait, but supermassive ones are millions to billions of solar masses. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. Oh wait, 1e10 parsecs is 10^10 parsecs. No, wait the question says distance d=1e10 parsecs. So that's 10,000 million parsecs. Wait, the parsec is a pretty large unit. Let me think, the nearest galaxy is about 1 parsec away? No, no. Wait, the nearest stars are about 1 parsec. The Andromeda galaxy is about 0.78 million parsecs (about 2.5 million light-years) away. So 1e10 parsecs is 10^10, which is 10 billion parsecs. That's a very large distance, like in the order of the size of the universe. But the angular size of the event horizon is θ=1e-17 degrees, which is extremely small, so that makes sense because the object is very far away.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the diameter of the event horizon is 2r, so when I calculate θ, it's diameter over distance. So, 2r = θ_rad * d.

Wait, θ in radians is approximately (subtended length)/distance. The subtended length is the size of the object, which is 2r for the diameter. So, θ_rad ≈ (2r)/d → r = (θ_rad * d)/2, which is what I did earlier.

So, back to calculating r: I get r ≈ 2.6e7 meters. So the event horizon radius is ~2.6e7 meters. Now, the area A is 4πr².

Calculating A: 4 * π * (2.6e7 m)^2.

Let's compute (2.6e7)^2: (2.6)^2 = 6.76; (1e7)^2 = 1e14. So 6.76e14 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. So 12.566 * 6.76e14 ≈ let's compute 12 *6.76=81.12, and 0.566*6.76≈ ~3.82. So total ≈ 84.94e14 m², or 8.494e15 m².

Wait, 4 * pi * (2.6e7)^2 = 4 * pi * (6.76e14) = 4 *3.1416 *6.76e14 ≈ 12.566 *6.76e14. Let me compute 12.566 *6.76: 12 *6.76=81.12, 0.566 *6.76≈3.82. So 81.12 +3.82=84.94. So 84.94e14 m² = 8.494e15 m².

So A is approximately 8.5e15 m².

Now, plug this into the entropy formula.

The formula is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B), but wait, I think the formula is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G) multiplied by k_B? Wait, no, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, double-checking: The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B), or is it S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G)? Hmm. Let me think: the natural units sometimes have ħ = c =1, but in SI units, the formula includes these constants.

Yes, the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G). I think that's correct. So S
