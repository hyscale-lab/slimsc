Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, let me visualize the structure. Benzene has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Oh right, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are probably in the 1, 2, 3 positions, but wait, that might require some meta or ortho directing. Hmm.

So the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Wait, that's a bit tricky because each substituent affects the others. Let me sketch it out mentally. If I number the ring, let's say the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. But wait, substituents can't all be adjacent unless it's a tri-substituted benzene with specific directing.

But
