Okay, so I have this question here about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniformly distributed—does that mean the same number of stars per unit volume? Or maybe per some other measure? I think in a uniform distribution, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant throughout space. But wait, when we look at them, how does that translate into the number we see in different parallax ranges?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. So, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, I need to find how many stars are in that range.

Let me think about the volume. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and the thickness is dd. So the volume element is 4πd² dd.

But since plx is 1/d, I can express d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But wait, dd is the change in d, and since
