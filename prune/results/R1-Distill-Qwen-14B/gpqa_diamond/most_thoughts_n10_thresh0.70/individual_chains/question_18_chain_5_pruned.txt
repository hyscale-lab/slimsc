Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. Alright, let's read the question again.

We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Using the EW method and LTE, their elemental abundances have been determined. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Hmm, I think the key here is to figure out the abundance of silicon in each star relative to hydrogen and then take the ratio. Let me recall what the notation means. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundance compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, the formula is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_☉, which is equivalent to log10(n_X/n_Y / (n_X_☉/n_Y_☉)) ). So, if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

So, for each star, we can compute the ratio of silicon to hydrogen, and then find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2.

Let's tackle Star_1 first.

Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log10(n_Fe☉/n_H☉) = 0 → log10(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log10(n_Fe☉/n_H☉). So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe☉/n_H☉.

Given that 12 + log10(nFe/nH)_sun =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Star_1, nFe1/nH1 = same as solar, so 10^(-4.5).

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log10(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log10(n_Si☉/n_Fe☉) = 0.3.

We can compute n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si☉/n_Fe☉).

Wait, but what's the solar Si/Fe ratio? Hmm, I don't have that directly. Oh wait, the given data includes 12 + log10(nMg/nH)_sun =7, so log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH_sun =10^(-5).

Wait, but that's Mg, not Si. Maybe I can get Si/Fe from the problem? Let's see. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of H because we know the Fe and Mg abundances relative to H for the Sun.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is solar. Also, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → so that tells us Si/Fe is higher than solar by a factor of 10^0.3.

So, let's get n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * (n_Fe1/n_H1)

n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si☉/n_Fe☉)

But I don't know n_Si☉/n_Fe☉. Hmm. Hmm, perhaps I can find it using the solar data given.

Wait, the Sun's data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH)_sun =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

But we don't
