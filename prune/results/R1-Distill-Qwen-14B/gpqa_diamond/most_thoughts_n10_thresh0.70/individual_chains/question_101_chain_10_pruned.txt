Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product formed is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what compound A is and what catalyst is used (either TsOH or acetic acid).

Hmm. So, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, right? 3-methyl would mean there's a methyl group at the third position. 

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me parse that. The substituent is at position 1 of the pyrrolidine ring. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Wait, cyclohexylidene suggests a cyclohexene group attached. Like, the cyclohexene is connected to a methylene group (CH2) perhaps? Or maybe it's a cyclohexylidene group attached as a substituent.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexylidenemethyl might be a cyclohexylidene (which is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond, like cyclohexene) connected via a methylene group. So, the group is CH2-Cyclohexene. Or maybe it's a cyclohexene ring where one of the carbons is a substituent attached via a methylene. Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure. 

Alternatively, the product has a substituent on the pyrrolidine ring that is a cyclohexylidene group. Wait, cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene group, like a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, the substituent is a cyclohexenylidene group attached as a methylene.

Wait, maybe it's more like a cyclohexenyl group attached via a methylene. So, the substituent is -(CH2)-Cyclohexene? Or perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with a double bond connected via a methylene group to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, I think the structure is: the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1 which
