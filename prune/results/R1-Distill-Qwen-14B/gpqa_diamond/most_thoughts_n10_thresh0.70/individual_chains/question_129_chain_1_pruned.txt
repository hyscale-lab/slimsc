Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct compound E. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with E. Also, there are some hints provided, which I should definitely consider.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form E.

And the hints are:

a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR spectra: A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's peak is around 1715 cm^-1.

Alright, let's start by thinking about each reaction and the possible structures.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN is a nucleophile. When it reacts with a ketone, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. Wait, but another possibility is if A is an aldehyde or ketone. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 is strong for a carbonyl group. So, A is probably a ketone because aldehydes usually have higher frequency (like around 1710-1740 for aldehydes, maybe? I need to remember the exact ranges). So, A is a ketone. Reaction with HCN would add a cyanide group to the carbonyl, producing a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with HCN, the product is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. So, for example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would be cyclohexane cyanohydrin. But the structure would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent.

Then, step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. So, the nitrile group (CN) would get reduced. Nitriles typically reduce to amines (with LiAlH4 or other strong reducing agents), but wait, H2 and Pd is a catalyst. Oh, right, hydrogenolysis of nitriles requires more specific conditions. Wait, the reduction of a nitrile with H2 and Pd would typically give an amine. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, maybe the nitrile becomes an amine, but perhaps in this case, it's a ketone becoming something else.

Wait, let me think again. The cyanohydrin is a secondary alcohol (from the ketone) and a nitrile group.

Wait, the structure of B would be a cycloalkane with adjacent OH and CN
