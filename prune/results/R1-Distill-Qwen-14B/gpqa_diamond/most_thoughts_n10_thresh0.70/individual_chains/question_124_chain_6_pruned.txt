Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Now, they want to find the Lorentz factor needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is related to how much time dilation or length contraction occurs. Oh right, from special relativity. So, if a particle's lifetime is tau (proper time), the time measured in the lab frame is gamma * tau. But the particles are moving, so the distance they can travel before decaying is their speed multiplied by the time they live.

Since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance traveled, L = gamma * c * tau. But wait, wait. Let me think again. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the distance they travel is v * gamma tau. Since v is approximately c, it's about gamma c tau.

Wait, but the particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel to reach the inner walls is the radius, which is 30 meters. So, L = gamma c tau should be equal to 30 meters for the case where they reach the wall, right? Or wait, not exactly. Because the particles are produced at the center, the maximum distance they can go is 30 meters. So, if the lifetime is such that they can only go 30 meters on average, that's when they reach the wall.

But wait, the problem states that with a Lorentz factor of about 20, only one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So, perhaps the average path length is more than 30 meters, allowing some particles to reach the walls and others to decay before that.

Wait, no, the situation is that particles are produced and move outward. The ones that reach the wall must have a path length equal to the radius, 30 meters. So, the number of particles that reach the wall depends on the fraction whose path
