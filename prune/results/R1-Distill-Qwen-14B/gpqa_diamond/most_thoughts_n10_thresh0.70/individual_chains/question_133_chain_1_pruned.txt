Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all that. But let me try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that these are phosphoric acid salts, so they must form a buffer solution. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

Wait, phosphoric acid (H3PO4) can donate three protons, so it has three dissociation steps. The K values given are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. Right, so each step is much weaker than the previous, which means the species present will depend on the pH.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which is H2PO4^- when dissolved. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which gives HPO4^2- ions. So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

I remember that when you have a buffer solution, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, which pKa value should I use here? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so that would be the second dissociation step. So the pKa would be the one for Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again: H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2). So the relevant pKa here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since log(6.2) is about 0.79, 0.79 + (-8) = -7.21, but wait pKa is -log(Ka), so 6.2e-8 is 8 - log(6.2) → log(6.2) is approx 0.79, so 8 - 0.79 is 7.21. So pKa2 is 7.21.

But wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and the base is HPO4^2-. So the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

Wait, but the question isn't directly asking about the pH, it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. Oh, right. PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation step. So HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12). So the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the pH of the solution, which in turn depends on the buffer components.

So first, I need to find the pH of the solution using the buffer, and then calculate [PO4^3-] using Ka3.

Wait, but wait. Since HPO4^2- is present, maybe I can use the third dissoci
