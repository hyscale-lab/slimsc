Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see... the question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. And they give the formation constant, KCa-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, but I think that's just a given condition and doesn't affect the calculation directly here.

Wait, I need to find the concentration of calcium ions. So the complex is Ca-EDTA, which I think is like CaEDTA^2- or something similar. The formula might be CaY^2- where Y is EDTA. So the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- (or whatever the form is, but I think the key is that it dissociates).

The formation constant K is given. Formation constants (Kf) are for the formation of the complex from its ions. So the reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since it's stoichiometric, I think all the Ca and EDTA are tied up in the complex. But wait, no, because the complex might dissociate a bit, so there's some free Ca^2+ and EDTA.

Wait, but the formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is a large K, so that means the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, so the concentration of free Ca^2+ and EDTA should be very small compared to the complex.

So the idea is that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M because it doesn't dissociate much. But let me think... Actually, the solution is prepared with 0.02 M of the complex, but depending on how it's made, maybe some of it dissociates. But since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal, so we can approximate that [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M
