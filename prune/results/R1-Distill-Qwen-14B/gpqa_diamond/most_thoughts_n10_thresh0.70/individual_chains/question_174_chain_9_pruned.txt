Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of questions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem is about atomic nucleus fission. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. The question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 value and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D in MeV.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out the correct approach here, considering relativity, and then compare it to the classical case. Let's break it down.

First, some key points:

1. Initial nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum is zero.
2. After fission, two fragments are produced. Since momentum is conserved and the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the two fragments must be zero. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me assign variables:

- Let the rest mass of the less massive fragment be m. Then the more massive one is 2m.
- The sum of their masses is m + 2m = 3m. But the problem states that the sum is 99% of M, which is the initial mass. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M.

Wait, that seems important. But wait, M is the initial rest mass, and the rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. But when the nucleus splits, the rest masses of the fragments sum to 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Wait, but in reality, in fission, the binding energy is released, so the sum of the rest masses of the products is less than the initial rest mass. But in this problem, it's given that the sum is 99% of M, so the mass lost is 1%, which is probably the energy released. So that's a point to remember.

So, the initial energy is at rest, so all energy is rest mass energy. After fission, the fragments have rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Since the system is isolated and no external forces, momentum is conserved. So the fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Because of the opposite momenta, their velocities are in opposite directions, but the more massive fragment will have a lower speed.

But I'm trying to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1). So the correct approach is to use relativistic mechanics, and then compare it to the classical calculation.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. How do I approach finding the kinetic energies of both fragments?

Let me think. The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest masses and their kinetic energies. But energy and momentum are conserved.

Let me denote:

- Let the velocity of the more massive fragment (2m) be v, and the less massive (m) be u.

But wait, since momentum is conserved, and the total initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So:

p1 = gamma * (2m) * v = p
p2 = gamma' * m * u = p

Wait, but since the total momentum is zero, p1 = -p2. So their magnitudes are equal. Therefore,

gamma(2m) v = gamma'(m) u

But because the
