Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what it's asking. Hmm, a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve calculating ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ where O is the operator.

So, the expectation value is linear, which means I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make things easier because I can compute each expectation separately.

First, let me recall what σz and σx are. σz is the Pauli z matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Similarly, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which I think has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But since we're calculating the expectation value, maybe I can use the properties of these operators without getting into their matrix forms.

Wait, but for the expectation value, perhaps it's easier to compute each term separately. Let me start with ⟨σz⟩.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩. To find ⟨σz⟩, I can note that |↑⟩ is an eigenstate of σz with eigenvalue +1, and |↓⟩ is an eigenstate with eigenvalue -1.

So, when I calculate ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, it should be |0.5|² * (+1) + |(√3/2)|² * (-1). Let me compute that. |0.5|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |√3/2|² is (3/4) = 0.75. So, 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis. The matrix for σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So when we apply σx to |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩, and vice versa.

So to compute ⟨σx⟩, it's ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me write this out:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5*, (√3/2)* ] [ [0,1],[1,0] ] [0.5; (√3/2) ]

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute the inner products. Let me represent |ψ⟩ as a column vector. In the σz basis, |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ is [0.5; (√3/2)].

Applying σx to ψ would swap the components, so σx|ψ⟩ = [√3/2; 0.5].

Then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, (√3/2)] and [√3/2, 0.5]. So that's 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5. Let me compute that: 0.5√3/2 is (√3)/4, and the second term is the same. So total is (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: since σx can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| +
