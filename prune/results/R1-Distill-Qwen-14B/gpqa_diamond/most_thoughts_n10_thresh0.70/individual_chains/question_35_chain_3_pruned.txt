Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm. Let me try to piece this together step by step. 

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, A_y. It says that A_y is a 2x2 matrix represented as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

So I think S looks like this:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And A_y is c times that. So substituting c in, A_y would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by that matrix. That gives A_y as:
[ 0      -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Wait, but maybe I don't need to compute all the elements right away. Because the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Oh right, eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

But wait, S is reminiscent of the Pauli matrices. Oh yeah, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me recall what they look like. Oh right, σ_y is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So wait, S is exactly σ_y. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So A_y = c * σ_y. And since c is h/(4π), then A_y = (h/(4π)) σ_y.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Because when you diagonalize them, their eigenvalues are ±1. So if A_y is (h/(4π)) times σ_y, then the eigenvalues a of A_y would be (h/(4π)) times the eigenvalues of σ_y. So the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1), right? So a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, that's real numbers. So the eigenvalues are real, meaning the imaginary parts are zero. So looking at the options, options A and B mention imaginary parts, so maybe they are incorrect. Let's see the options again.
