Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D with different r coordinates.

Wait, what's a density matrix again? Oh right, in quantum mechanics, a density matrix represents the state of a system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projection operator, but this looks mixed because of the 1/2 factor.

So, the given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in matrix form. |0> is [1;0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Multiply by 1/2, so ρ is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. That’s a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Now, what does this represent? Each diagonal entry in the density matrix corresponds to the probability of the qubit being in that state. So, ρ has equal probabilities for |0> and |1>, each 50%. So this is a completely mixed state for a qubit, right?

Wait, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I remember that the space of qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The density matrices correspond to points in this space. For a general single-qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Let me write that down. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, and σ is a vector of Pauli matrices. So, solving for r, we have r·σ = 2ρ - I.

Given that ρ is diagonal as [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]], let me compute 2ρ. That would be [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So 2ρ - I is [[0,0],[0,0]]. Therefore, r·σ must be zero matrix.

Hmm, r·σ is a sum of the components times Pauli matrices. Let me denote r as (x,y,z). Then r·σ = x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, if r·σ is the zero matrix, each component must be zero. Let me set up the equation:

x [[0,1],[1,0]] + y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + z [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[0,0],[0,0]]

Looking at each element:

Top-left: z*1 = 0 → z=0.

Top-right: x*1 + y*(-i) = 0.

Bottom-left: x*1 + y*i = 0.

Bottom-right: z*(-1) = 0 → already satisfied since z=0.

So, from top-right and bottom-left:

x - i y = 0

x + i y = 0

Wait, how can both be zero? Let's see:

From top-right equation: x = i y.

From bottom-left: x = -i y.

So, setting x = i y and x = -i y leads to i y = -i y → (i + i) y = 0 → 2i y =0 → y=0.

Then, x = i y = 0 and x = -i y =0. So x=0 and
