Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two given reactions. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (in water) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each providing possible reagents for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that in organic chemistry, the choice of reagents often determines the type of reaction that occurs. Let me think about each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let's draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a cyanide source. I think this is a nucleophilic addition reaction. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. So in a ketone, the carbonyl group is a good electrophile.

In the presence of a base, the carbonyl oxygen can be deprotonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then, a nucleophile like CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction?

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write its structure. It's CH2(C(CN)(OH)CH3) something? Wait, but let me think. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but this product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the butanenitrile part is four carbons, with the nitrile on C4. The hydroxy and methyl are on C2.

So it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait,
