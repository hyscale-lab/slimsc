Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I should probably write that matrix out.

So S would look like:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Right. Then, Ay is c*S. Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in, Ay becomes (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So each element of S gets multiplied by that constant.

But wait, the question isn't asking for Ay directly. It's asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh, right, eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ. So a is the eigenvalue. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

First, I remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. So let's set that up.

But wait, maybe I can find the eigenvalues of S first, and then scale them by c since Ay is c multiplied by S. Because if S has eigenvalues λ, then Ay = c S would have eigenvalues c λ. That's because if
