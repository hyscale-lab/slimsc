Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I've heard that dithiocyanato complexes have more than one SCN- ligand. So, probably, the blue one is a specific complex with a certain number of SCN- ions attached.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants are the formation constants, right? So βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Assuming dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions, but wait, no, wait: dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. But sometimes, the color changes with the number of ligands, like in the case of Co with different SCN- counts. So the blue complex is probably a specific one, maybe the tetrathiocyanato complex. Or wait, maybe it's the hexadentate or something else. Wait, the question says 'dithiocyanato' which I think refers to two SCN- ligands. Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". So I think that refers to the Co with two SCN- ligands. Wait, but I remember that the [Co(SCN)_6]^3- complex is blue. Oh, wait, but that's six SCN- ions. Hmm, maybe the problem is referring to the tetrathiocyanate or another complex. Wait, perhaps I should look up the common colors. Oh right, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue, I think. Wait, no, I might be mixing up with other metal ions. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex as blue. But I'm not entirely certain. Wait, maybe I should proceed with the
