Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.

The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D with various resolutions in meters.

I think I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. So the formula for the observed lifetime τ would be τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the problem is about the resolution needed. Oh right, the resolution has to do with the distance the particle travels before decaying. Because if the particle moves a certain distance before decaying, the detector has to be able to resolve that distance. So the minimum resolution relates to the minimum distance the particle travels, which would correspond to the minimum time we can detect.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. The longer the lifetime, the farther the particle travels. So to detect a decay, the particle's lifetime must be such that it doesn't travel too far beyond our ability to detect. So the question is probably about the minimum distance that allows us to see 30% of the decays.

Wait, but how do I figure out the distance? I think the number of decays observed depends on the probability that the particle decays within a certain time, which is related to the distance it travels. The proper lifetime is the mean lifetime, so the probability of decay is given by 1 - e^(-t/τ₀), where t is the time the particle exists in the lab frame. But wait, actually, in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so τ = γ τ₀.

Wait, so the time experienced by the lab is longer, so the decay probability is lower. But wait, the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. So we need P ≥
