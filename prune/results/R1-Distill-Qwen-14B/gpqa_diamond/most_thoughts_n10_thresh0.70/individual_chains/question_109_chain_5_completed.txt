Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, which I think have something to do with the symmetry of the wavefunction. The problem gives an equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. The options give different possible transitions, and I need to find which partial wave isn't allowed. 

Wait, I remember that when particles are identical fermions, their total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric. So maybe that's what Pauli's exclusion principle is about here. The wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and other parts. For identical particles, the symmetry depends on their quantum numbers.

The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0. Because 2*0 +1=1, so 1 S 0. 

So when the two nucleons emit a particle X, the final state is the NN system, let's say, and X. I need to look at the possible transitions.

The question says that each option is a transition: 1S0 -> something + X, where the lowercase denotes the angular momentum state of X. So for example, option A is 7D1 + p. Wait, D1 probably means L=2 (since D is L=2) and M=1. But I'm not sure if that's important for this problem.

The key is to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity. Also, the Pauli statistics condition given: T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about that condition. Let me think. The equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin of the final NN state, and S and L are their spin and orbital angular momentum. So, when we have T being 0, let's plug that in.

0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So S + L +1 must be even, because mod 2, 0 is even. So S + L must be odd. Because 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → (S + L) mod 2 = 1.

So for the final state, S(NN) and L(NN) must have their sum being odd. So S and L can't both be even or both be odd because their sum would be even. So one has to be even and the other odd.

Now, looking at the possible transitions. Each option gives the final state of the NN system after emitting X. So in each case, the NN state after emission has certain quantum numbers. Let me find out their S, L, and T.

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. So for the initial state, S=0, L=0. When the NN system emits X, their angular momentum and spin might change. But with angular momentum conservation.

Wait, the system's total angular momentum J must be conserved? Or is it that the process must conserve the total angular momentum, including the emitted particle.

Wait, no, the total angular momentum isn't necessarily conserved unless it's an isolated system. But in this case, since the NN system is emitting a particle, the total angular momentum is conserved. So the initial total angular momentum is J_initial = (S_initial + L_initial) = 0 + 0 = 0.

After emission, the total angular momentum must be zero as well. So the combined angular momentum of the NN system and X must sum to zero.

Hmm, so each option gives the NN state after emission (like 7D1, etc.) and the X's angular momentum. Let me parse each option.

Each option is like: 1S0 → (NN state) + X. The X's state is given by a lowercase letter, which I think denotes its orbital angular momentum quantum number. Because, for example, "p" is l=1.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

So each option's final NN state is written as (2S+1)L(J), I think. For example, 7D1 would mean (2S+1)=7 → S=3, L=D=2, J=1. Because D is L=2.

So let's break down each option's NN state:

Option A: 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L is D=2. J=1.

Option B: 3S1. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=S=0? Wait, no: the spectroscopic notation is (2S+1)L J. So S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=S? Wait no, the letter after the number is the spectroscopic symbol for L. S is L=0, P=1, D=2, etc. So 3S1 → S=1, L=0, J=1.

Option C: 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=D=2. J=3.

Option D: 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=P=1. J=0.

Wait, so for each option, the NN state has its own S, L, J. Now, the emitted X's angular momentum state is given in the options. The X's orbital angular momentum is, for example, p → l=1, s → l=0, f → l=3, etc.

So for each option, we can write down:

NN state: S_NN, L_NN, J_NN
X: l_X

But since the total angular momentum is conserved, the sum of the NN's J and X's l (since X is a boson? Or maybe it's a fermion. Wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. But I'm not sure if X is a boson or a fermion. The question says it's a particle emitted, but the NN are nucleons, which are fermions. I'm not sure if X is a meson or something else. But for angular momentum, perhaps I can consider the orbital angular momentum part.

Wait, but the total angular momentum (J) of the NN system plus the orbital angular momentum (l) of X must equal the initial J. The initial J is zero.

Wait, but the total angular momentum is a vector sum. So J_NN + l_X (as vectors) must sum to zero. But in practice, their magnitudes must satisfy | J_NN - l_X | ≤ J_total ≤ J_NN + l_X. But since J_total is zero, the only possibility is J_NN = l_X and the direction opposite.

So J_NN must equal l_X. Because if their vector sum is zero, then their magnitudes must be equal and opposite. But that requires that J_NN = l_X. However, J_NN is a possible total angular momentum, which is made up from the coupling of S_NN and L_NN.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The initial state has J_initial = 0. After emission, the total angular momentum is the combination of the NN's J and X's l (since X is a spin-0 particle? Or maybe X has spin, but in the problem, perhaps we're considering only orbital angular momentum for X's contribution. Hmm, I'm not quite sure. The problem states that X's intrinsic parity is -1, but maybe it's a spin-0 particle? Or not.

Alternatively, perhaps the X's spin isn't considered here, and we're only considering orbital angular momentum. Or perhaps the X is a spin-1 particle because it's parity is -1. But this is unclear.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the orbital angular momentum only. The initial state has J=0, which is the sum of the NN's spin and orbital angular momentum. After emission, the NN's J plus the orbital angular momentum of X must sum to zero. So the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) must equal NN's J (J_NN) in magnitude and opposite direction. Which implies that J_NN = l_X.

So for each option, I can compute J_NN and l_X, and see if J_NN equals l_X.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: NN state is 7D1 → S=3, L=2, J=1. X is p → l=1.

So J_NN is 1, l_X is 1. So 1 = 1. So this is possible.

Option B: NN state is 3S1 → S=1, L=0, J=1. X is p → l=1. So J_NN=1, l_X=1 → 1=1. Possible.

Option C: NN state is 3D3 → S=1, L=2, J=3. X is f → l=3. So J_NN=3, l_X=3. 3=3 → possible.

Option D: NN state is 3P0 → S=1, L=1, J=0. X is s → l=0. So J_NN=0, l_X=0 → 0=0. Possible.

Wait, that's strange. All options' J_NN equals l_X. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe it's the total angular momentum, not just the orbital. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the initial and final total angular momentum.

The initial state has J_initial = 0. After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of NN's J and X's spin and orbital angular momentum. Wait, but I'm not considering the spin of X. Hmm, the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. The intrinsic parity is a property that depends on whether the particle is a boson or fermion and its angular momentum. For orbital angular momentum, parity is (-1)^L, so for X, its orbital part contributes parity (-1)^l. But I'm getting a bit off track.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the conservation of parity. The initial state parity is given, and the final state parity should be the same. So parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

The initial state is 1S0 → S=0, L=0. So the parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.

The final state's parity is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because when a particle is emitted, the parity of the system (the product of the parity of the NN and X) should equal the initial parity.

So, parity_final = parity_NN * parity_X.

But what's the parity of the NN state? The parity operator is P, and the parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So for the NN state, parity is (-1)^{L(NN)}.

The parity of X is intrinsic, which is given as -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^{L_X} × (-1)^{spin related terms}. Wait, intrinsic parity is a property that includes spin and other factors. For a spin-0 particle, parity is (-1)^L, but for higher spins, it's more complicated. Wait, but maybe for this problem, the intrinsic parity is given as -1, so regardless of X's L, the parity is -1. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating.

Wait, the problem states that particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So parity_X = -1.

So, parity_final = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1) = (-1)^{L_NN + 1}.

But the initial parity is +1. So:

(-1)^{L_NN + 1} = +1 → (-1)^{L_NN + 1} = 1.

Which implies that L_NN + 1 must be even → L_NN must be odd.

Because (-1) raised to an even number is 1. So L_NN +1 even → L_NN is odd.

So the orbital angular momentum L of the NN state after emission must be odd.

Now, let's look at each option's NN state and see if L_NN is odd.

Option A: NN state is 7D1 → L=2 (D is 2). 2 is even → L_NN is even. So parity condition not satisfied. So Option A: parity would be (-1)^{2+1} = (-1)^3 = -1. Which doesn't match initial parity of +1. So this can't happen. So Option A is not allowed.

Wait, but let me check all options.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 (S is 0) which is even. So L_NN=0 is even. So parity would be (-1)^{0+1} = (-1)^1 = -1. Which doesn't match initial. So Option B is not allowed.

Option C: 3D3 → L=2 (D=2) → even. So parity would be (-1)^{2+1}= -1. Not allowed. So Option C is not allowed.

Option D: 3P0 → L=1 (P is 1) → odd. So parity is (-1)^{1+1}=1. Which matches initial parity. So this is allowed.

Wait, but earlier, the parity condition requires that L_NN must be odd. So only options with L_NN odd are allowed.

Looking again:

Option A: L=2 → even → not allowed.
Option B: L=0 → even → not allowed.
Option C: L=2 → even → not allowed.
Option D: L=1 → odd → allowed.

So, the only allowed option is D, and the others are invalid. But the question is asking which partial wave is NOT permitted. So which options don't satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the Pauli statistics condition, I found that T=0 implies S + L must be odd.

So let's apply that as well.

The Pauli condition: T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

So for each option, check if S_NN + L_NN is odd.

Option A: NN state S=3, L=2. 3+2=5 → odd. So condition holds. But parity doesn't. So this option is invalid due to parity.

Option B: S=1, L=0. 1+0=1 → odd. So condition holds, but parity doesn't.

Option C: S=1, L=2. 1+2=3 → odd. Condition holds. But parity doesn't.

Option D: S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 → even. So condition not met. Because 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → (S + L) mod 2 should be 1. So for option D, S+L=2 → mod 2 is 0. So 0= (0) +1 mod 2 → 0=1 mod 2 → which is false. So option D's condition doesn't hold. But wait, that's conflicting with the parity condition.

Wait, let me recheck. For option D: After emission, NN has T=0, S=1, L=1.

So T=0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → 0 = (1 +1) +1 mod 2 → 0 = 3 mod 2 → 0=1 → which is not true. So option D doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

Wait, but the parity condition is satisfied for option D, but the Pauli condition isn't. So which takes precedence? Both conditions must be satisfied.

So let's go back to each option:

For each option, two conditions must be met:

1. Parity: parity_final = initial parity → L_NN must be odd.

2. Pauli: T= S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L must be odd.

So let's check each option.

Option A: L=2 (even), so parity condition not met → invalid.

Option B: L=0 (even), parity no → invalid.

Option C: L=2 (even), parity no → invalid.

Option D: L=1 (odd) → parity yes.

But Pauli condition: S=1, L=1. S + L =2 → even. So 0 = even +1 mod 2 → 0 =1 → no. So Pauli condition not met → invalid.

Wait, but none of the options satisfy both conditions. That can't be right because the question should have one correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity condition.

Wait, when the particle X is emitted, the parity of the entire system (NN and X) should have the same parity as the initial state. So:

parity_initial = parity_NN * parity_X * (-1)^L_X.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the parity of the NN system and X. The parity of the NN system is (-1)^{L_NN}, and the parity of X is given as -1. So the total parity is (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1) * (-1)^{L_X} ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. When two particles (A and B) are in a state with orbital angular momentum L_AB, their parity is (-1)^{L_AB}. When a particle X is emitted, the total parity would be the product of the parity of the NN system (P_NN) and the parity of X (P_X), multiplied by (-1)^{L_X}, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

P_final = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^{L_X}.

Because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum between the emitting system and X is L_X, which contributes a parity factor of (-1)^{L_X}.

So combining this, P_final = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1) * (-1)^{L_X}.

And since parity is conserved, P_final must equal P_initial, which is +1.

So:

(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1) * (-1)^{L_X} = 1.

Simplify:

(-1)^{L_NN +1 + L_X} = 1.

Which implies that L_NN + 1 + L_X must be even.

So L_NN + L_X must be odd.

So, L_NN + L_X is odd.

Now, for each option, let me compute L_NN + L_X and see if it's odd.

Earlier, I thought only L_NN was involved, but perhaps it's the sum of L_NN and L_X.

Let me reevaluate each option.

Option A: NN is 7D1 → L_NN=2. X is p → L_X=1.

Sum: 2+1=3 → odd → condition holds.

So parity condition is satisfied.

Now, Pauli condition: T=0 → S + L +1 mod 2 =0.

In this case, S=3, L=2.

3 +2 =5 → mod2=1. 1 +1=2 → mod2=0. So 0=0 → condition holds.

So for option A, both conditions are satisfied.

But earlier I thought the problem said which partial wave is NOT permitted. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me re-examine the options with this new parity condition.

Option A: NN state L=2, X l=1 → sum is 3 (odd). So parity condition holds.

Pauli condition: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → mod2=1. 1+1=2 mod2=0 → T=0. So condition holds.

So option A is allowed.

Option B: NN L=0, X l=1. Sum 0+1=1 → odd. Parity condition holds.

Pauli condition: S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → mod2=1. 1+1=2 mod2=0 → T=0, condition holds.

So option B is allowed.

Option C: NN L=2, X l=3. Sum 2+3=5 → odd → parity holds.

Pauli condition: S=1, L=2 → 1+2=3 → mod2=1. 1+1=2 → 0 → condition holds. So option C is allowed.

Option D: NN L=1, X l=0. Sum 1+0=1 → odd → parity holds.

Pauli condition: S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → mod2=0. 0+1=1 mod2 → 1 ≠0 → Pauli condition not met. So option D is invalid.

Wait, so only option D doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition, but the parity condition is satisfied.

So the problem asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the one that doesn't satisfy either condition. In this case, option D fails the Pauli condition.

Wait, let's recap:

The parity condition is L_NN + L_X is odd. For each option:

A: 2+1=3 → odd → okay.

B:0+1=1 → okay.

C:2+3=5 → okay.

D:1+0=1 → okay.

So all options satisfy the parity condition except for none. But earlier analysis when I thought that L_NN must be odd was incorrect. That was because I didn't consider the X's orbital angular momentum in the parity calculation.

So the parity condition is satisfied for all options. So the only condition to check is the Pauli condition.

So, for each option, check if S + L is odd (since T=0 → S + L must be odd).

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → odd → condition holds.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → odd → condition holds.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 3 → odd → condition holds.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 2 → even → condition doesn't hold.

So, option D's Pauli condition isn't satisfied, making it the forbidden transition.

So the question is which partial wave is not permitted. The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p → allowed.

B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p → allowed.

C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f → allowed.

D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s → not allowed.

So the answer is option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The system starts in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The intrinsic parity of this state is \( (-1)^L = +1 \).

2. **Conservation of Parity**: After the emission of particle \( X \), the total parity of the system (NN and \( X \)) must equal the initial parity. The parity of the NN state is \( (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} \), and the parity of \( X \) is given as \( -1 \). The total parity is:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^{L_X} = (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}} + L_X + 1}.
   \]
   Since \( P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \), we require:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}} + L_X + 1} = 1 \implies L_{\text{NN}} + L_X + 1 \text{ is even} \implies L_{\text{NN}} + L_X \text{ is odd}.
   \]

3. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: For the final NN state with \( T = 0 \), the condition is:
   \[
   T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \implies 0 = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \implies S + L \text{ is odd}.
   \]
