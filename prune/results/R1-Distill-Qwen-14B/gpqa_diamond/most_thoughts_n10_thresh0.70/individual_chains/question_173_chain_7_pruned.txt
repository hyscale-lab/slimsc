Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the quantum mechanics stuff yet. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about the uncertainty principle. I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), something like Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes I see it written with ħ, which is h/(2π), so the formula becomes Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2 or maybe ħ/ something. Wait, I should get that right. I think the correct formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Or is it ħ? I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look that up, but since I can't right now, I'll proceed with what I think.

The problem says the electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position is Δx = 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Hmm, so the initial step is to calculate the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, using the uncertainty principle. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy. But wait, how does Δp relate to ΔE? I think for non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So the uncertainty in energy would come from the uncertainty in p squared over 2m.

Wait, but if Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, then ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m), assuming that the kinetic energy is the main contributor to the energy uncertainty. Right? Because the energy is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy would be the derivative of E with respect to p times Δp. The derivative of (p²/(
