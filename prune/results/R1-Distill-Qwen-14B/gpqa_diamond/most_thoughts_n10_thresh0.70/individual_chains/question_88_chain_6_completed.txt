Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments involving GFP-tagged proteins. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the scenario: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, they used in vivo imaging and observed two main issues. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, which probably means that part of the protein was digested. The other issue is that some proteins got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. 

Wait, secondary lymphoid organs include things like Peyer's patches, which are in the intestinal wall. So the GFP proteins that didn't get destroyed made it there. Then they isolated the proliferating cells from the fluorescent Peyer patches. They sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. 

Hmm, high variability in the variable regions suggests something that changes the structure of the immunoglobulins. I remember that during an immune response, B cells undergo several processes that lead to diversity in the antibodies they produce.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination occurs during the generation of the initial B cell receptor, in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region. But that happens during B cell development, not necessarily after they've been activated by an antigen.

Class switching is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which happens after the primary immune response. This involves recombination at the heavy chain locus, but it doesn't directly affect the variable regions, just the constant regions.

Complement activation is more about the destruction of pathogens and not directly related to the variability in the variable regions. So probably not B.

Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs in activated B cells, especially in germinal centers. Here, the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes undergo point mutations, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This helps in fine-tuning the immune response and leads to higher affinity antibodies.

So in this experiment, when the GFP-tagged proteins (antigens) reach the Peyer's patches, which are sites of B cell activation, the B cells that recognize the antigen start proliferating. These cells undergo somatic hypermutation, leading to a diverse set of variable regions. That explains the high variability seen in the sequencing results.

Wait, but what about the other options again? VDJ is during initial development, so the cells in the Peyer's patches are probably mature B cells that have already undergone this. So the process observed here is probably after initial development, which would be somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some GFP fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, where they activate B cells. These activated B cells proliferate, and their variable heavy chain genes are sequenced, showing high variability.

Key processes related to immune responses include:

1. **VDJ Recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are rearranged to form the variable region of the B cell receptor. Since the Peyer patches contain mature B cells, this process is unlikely to be occurring here.

2. **Class Switching Recombination**: This involves changing the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and occurs after B cells are activated. However, it does not directly affect the variable regions of the immunoglobulins, which explains the observed variability.

3. **Complement Activation**: This process is involved in pathogen destruction and is unrelated to the variability in the variable regions of the antibodies.

4. **Somatic Hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells, particularly in germinal centers, where point mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes. This increases antibody diversity and affinity, explaining the high variability observed in the sequencing results.

Given the context of the experiment and the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, the process most consistent with the observations is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
