Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think it through. The question involves two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water produce different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Alright, so first, I should probably understand what reaction is happening here. The reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Oh wait, that rings a bell. That's the nitrous acid (HNO2) reaction, which is typically used for diazotization. Diazotization usually occurs with aromatic amines or certain other amines, right? Wait, no, wait. Diazonium salts are usually formed from aromatic amines, but there are other reactions too. Alternatively, I've heard that in some cases, especially with ketones or aldehydes, the reaction with nitrous acid can lead to something else... Hmm, wait, maybe not. Wait no, what about the Beckmann rearrangement? Oh wait, that's when you have an oxime (a compound with an N-O bond where the oxygen is attached to a carbonyl group) reacting under certain conditions to form an amide or rearrange into a ketone or something else. Oh! So maybe the compounds A and B are oximes, and upon treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O, they undergo Beckmann rearrangement to form diketones.

Wait, but Beckmann rearrangement uses H2O as
