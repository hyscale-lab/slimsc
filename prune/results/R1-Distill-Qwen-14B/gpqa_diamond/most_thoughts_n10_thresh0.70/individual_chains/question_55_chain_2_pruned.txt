Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound it is. Let's see... The options are all some kind of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm, I remember that in these types of compounds, the NMR signals can give a lot of information about the structure, especially the double bonds and substituents.

The NMR data provided is 1H NMR: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). Let's break each peak down.

Starting with the 7.0 ppm peak: that's a downfield shift, which usually indicates aromatic protons. Wait, but acetate esters don't have aromatic rings. Oh wait, maybe it's a vinyl proton, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen? Because in an ester, the carbonyl oxygen can deshield nearby protons.

The 7.0 peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant. I think that suggests a trans coupling between two protons on adjacent carbons. Like, if there's a double bond and the two protons are on opposite sides, the coupling would be around 16 Hz. So that's probably a trans coupling.

Next, the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe this is another vinyl proton, but in a more complicated environment. Let me think. A doublet of quartets usually comes from splitting by two different sets of protons. Like, one neighboring group with two protons and another with four, but wait, in this case maybe not.

Wait, maybe the structure is an ester where the propenyl or butenyl group is attached. Let me visualize the structures. The question is between propenyl and butenyl, cis or trans.

Propenyl acetate would have a structure like CH2=CHCH2-OAc for trans, or CH2CH2OAc but wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2OAc? Wait, no, wait. Acetate esters are like R-O-CO-OCH3 or something. Wait, acetate is OAc, so the ester is R-OAc.

So for propenyl acetate, it would be CH2CH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-OAc? No, I think propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, propenyl has three carbons with a double bond. So propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. But wait, acetate ester is OAc-O-R. So the propenyl would be attached to the oxygen. So structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be. Wait, no: propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. So the propenyl is attached to the oxygen as the R group.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures and how their NMR would look.

If the compound is propenyl acetate, the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think about the NMR again.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. So that's a proton coupled to another with a large coupling. Then the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Maybe that's a proton that's split by two different neighboring groups.

So, let's imagine the structure. Let's say it's a propenyl group. Then the structure would be something like:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, that's not right. The actual structure is OAc-O-R where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. So R is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the protons on the double bond would be the ones giving the signals near 7.0 and 5.5
