Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are of the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is falling vertically on this aperture, creating intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The task is to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, alright. I remember that when dealing with such apertures, the diffraction pattern is determined by the shape of the aperture. Since the N is going to infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Wait, wait, no. Wait, an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal... Oh wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So if all apothems are the same, as N increases, the shape approaches a regular polygon, which for infinite N becomes a circle. So in the limit, the aperture is a circle with radius 'a'? Because the apothem 'a' would be the radius of the circumscribed circle around the polygon? Or wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the apothem (a) is the distance from the center to the middle of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle by the formula a = R * cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' in that case would approach the radius R. So when N is very large, the shape is approximately a circle with radius a, because as N increases, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a.

Wait, but the problem states that all apothems are the same, so perhaps the shape is such that it's a regular polygon, and with N approaching infinity, it's a circle. So the far field diffraction pattern would be similar to a circular aperture.

But no, wait, wait. The question isn't about a circular aperture. Because the options don't have the usual 1.22λ/a, which is the first minimum for a circular aperture. But let's see the options again. Option C is 1.220 λ/a. So that might be a hint. But wait, maybe it's not a circular aperture. Wait, the problem is about a polygonal aperture with all apothems the same. So maybe the diffraction pattern is different.

Wait, but the question says N is infinitely large. So the shape becomes like a circle. So perhaps the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem says it's an N-sided polygon, and all apothems are the same. So perhaps each side is equidistant from the center. So when N is large, it's a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be similar to that of a circular aperture.

Wait, but then the first minima for a circular aperture is at θ = 1.22λ/(diameter). Because the formula is sinθ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter. But wait, in this case, the diameter would be 2a, because the apothem is a. Wait, no. Wait, the apothem (a) is the radius of the inscribed circle. So the radius of the polygon is larger. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, for a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius (R) is the distance from the center to a vertex. The relationship between R and the apothem (a) is a = R * cos(π/N). So for large N, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon
