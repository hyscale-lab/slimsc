Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let's see what it's about. 

The question involves a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, that suggests maybe a splitting or some kind of diastereotopic situation? But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. That means they have the same molecular weight. So, the same compound or something else? Since the NMR is showing an issue, but the mass is the same, it's probably not a different molecule like a fragment or a byproduct. 

Let me think about the options. 

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it were a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have the same formula but maybe missing a part. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected, so A is probably not correct.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and same NMR chemical shifts because they're mirror images. But in the NMR, if they were enantiomers, wouldn't the peaks be the same? Wait, but in an enantiomer mixture, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. Because each enantiomer would have the same environment, so the NMR would look like a single peak. Unless something else is causing splitting. But the question says they're two separate peaks integrating to 1H together, which suggests maybe diastereotopic protons?

Wait, no. Enantiomers have the same NMR shifts because they're identical in all but mirror image. So if the mixture is of enantiomers, the NMR would not show two peaks for the same proton. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe during the reaction, some kind of coupling happened more than once, leading to extra peaks. But I don't remember exactly. Alternatively, sometimes in reactions like peptide coupling, especially when there's a coupling
