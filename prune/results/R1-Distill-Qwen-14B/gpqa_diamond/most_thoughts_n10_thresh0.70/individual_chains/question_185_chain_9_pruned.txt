Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where ε is an energy constant, and n is a unit vector. The σ are the Pauli spin matrices. 

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each of which are 2x2 matrices. Each σ has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Wait, no, wait. Actually, each Pauli matrix multiplied by some coefficient might have different eigenvalues.

Wait, no, the Pauli matrices themselves, when multiplied by a vector and summed (like σ · n), form a matrix. So the operator here is H = ε times that sum. Let me think about what the eigenvalues of such a matrix would be.

I remember that for any vector in the space, when you have a matrix like σ · n, where n is a unit vector, that matrix is a Hermitian matrix. Because each Pauli matrix is Hermitian, and the sum multiplied by real coefficients (since n is a unit vector, so each component is real and squared sums to 1) would also be Hermitian. So H is Hermitian, which means it has real eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues of σ · n... I think the trace of σ · n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. The trace of H would then be ε times the trace of σ · n, which would also be zero. So the eigenvalues should be symmetric around zero.

What's the determinant of σ · n? The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc. For σ · n, since each Pauli matrix has determinant -1, maybe? Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, each Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. So when you have σ · n, that's a matrix that can be written as n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. What's the square of this matrix? Let's think about (σ · n)^2. Since the Pauli matrices satisfy the relation σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol.

Wait, but when we square σ · n, we get (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, it's n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + cross terms. Each σ_i squared is the identity matrix I, because σ_i^2 = I for each i. So the first terms add up to (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So the square becomes I plus the cross terms. Wait, but cross terms involve σ_i σ_j and σ_j σ_i.

Wait, the cross terms: for example, n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x). But σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, and σ_y σ_x = -i σ_z. So σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x equals zero. Similarly, other cross terms will vanish because they would involve terms like σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, which are zero except when i=j. Wait, but wait, for each pair, the cross terms would involve 2n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. Oh wait, no, because when you expand (a + b + c)^2, it's a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So each term like 2n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x). But as I thought earlier, σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x = 0 because σ_x σ_y = i σ_z and σ_y σ_x = -i sigma_z. So their sum is zero. So all the cross terms vanish. Therefore, (σ · n)^2 = I.

So (σ · n)^2 = I. Then, the square of H is [ε (σ · n)]^2 = ε² (σ · n)^2 = ε² I. So H squared is ε² I, which implies that the eigenvalues of H must satisfy λ^2 = ε². So λ must be ± ε.

Wait, wait. Because H^2 is ε² I, so the eigenvalues of H^2 are ε², each. But the square roots of ε² are ε and -ε. So the eigenvalues of H must be + ε and - ε.

So looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. That would be the answer. Let me check the options again.

Option B says plus epsilon, minus epsilon. Option C is plus epsilon hbar/2, etc. Why would that be? Oh, because in some cases, like the spin in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator, which has factors of ħ. But wait, in this problem, is the spin operator represented as σ or as σ ħ/2?

Wait, wait. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices represent spin-1/2 systems. So the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ. So if the Hamiltonian were H = ω S · n, then the eigenvalues would be ± ħ ω / 2.

Wait a minute, but in the current problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. So if we had H = ε (σ · n), then the eigenvalues are ± ε. But wait, in the standard spin-1/2 case, the eigenvalues would be ± (ε) because H = ε σ · n, but if σ is multiplied by ħ/2, then the eigenvalues would be ± ε (ħ/2). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. So when H is written as H = ε σ · n, then the eigenvalues of H are ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. Since the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, H would have eigenvalues ± ε. So that would make option B correct.

But wait, I remember that sometimes people define the spin operator as S = (ħ/2) σ. So if σ were being used in the equation as S, then S would be (σ) with a scaling factor. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, which is ε times the sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by components of n. So in that case, the eigenvalues are indeed ± ε.

So the answer should be B. Let me check the options again.

Option B:
