Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D with some very small distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like decay length L = c * τ * β * γ, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, β is v/c, and γ is the Lorentz factor.

But first, I need to find the lifetime τ. Oh wait, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. I think the uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But I also have to consider relativistic effects because the particle is moving at high speeds.

Wait, the production energy is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is probably moving relativistically. So the energy E is related to the mass and the velocity. Let me think about the energy equation.

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can find the momentum p. Oh but E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so E is much larger than m, so the particle is ultrarelativistic. Hmm, but let's calculate it properly.

E = 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (8)^2 = (p c)^2 + (1.2)^2 → 64 = (p c)^2 + 1.44 → (p c)^2 = 62.56 → p c = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV. So p ≈ 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, the momentum p is related to the mass and velocity. Alternatively, I can find β and γ. Since E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ is about 6.6667.

Wait, but γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β can be found from that. Let me compute β. Let's compute 1 - β² = 1 / γ² → 1 - (β²) = (1.2/8)^2? Wait, wait, no. Because γ = 8/(1.2) ≈ 6.6667.

So 1/γ² is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - β² ≈ 0.0225 → β² ≈ 0.9775 → β ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So the beta is about 0.9887, so velocity is about 0.9887c.

Now, the lifetime τ is the proper lifetime, and the mean lifetime is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, the units are in MeV, but ħ is in units of GeV·s or something. Let me get the units straight.

Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ → 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems correct. So the proper lifetime is around 2.056875e-24 seconds.

But wait, in the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is τ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by gamma. So the actual lifetime is τ_lab = gamma * tau. So tau_lab = gamma * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, that's right. Because gamma is the time dilation factor. So the mean lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau = hbar / Gamma). So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

So tau_lab = gamma * (ħ / Γ) = (6.6667) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) )

Let me compute that:

6.6667 * (6.582e-25 / 0.32) → 6.6667 * 20.56875e-25 → Approximately 137.33e-25 s → 1.3733e-23 seconds.

Wait, that's the actual lifetime in the lab frame.

Then, the decay length L is c multiplied by beta gamma times tau (or beta gamma times the proper lifetime, but since gamma is already considered in the lab frame, maybe I have to adjust. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the decay length formula is L = c * beta * gamma * tau. Because gamma is the time dilation factor, and beta is the velocity factor. But wait, tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the rest frame. So in lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So during that time, the particle moves at velocity v = beta c. So L = v * (gamma tau) ) = beta c * gamma tau = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, but tau is hbar / Gamma. So L = beta gamma c tau = beta gamma c (hbar / Gamma).

So let me compute this step by step.

Compute beta gamma: beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667. So beta gamma is 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ approximately 6.6.

So, beta gamma ≈ 6.6.

c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

hbar is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So putting it all together:

L = beta gamma * c * (hbar / Gamma)

So substituting numbers,

L = 6.6 * (3e8 m/s) * (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV)

Wait, let's compute that.

First, compute 6.6 * 3e8 = 1.98e9.

Then multiply by 6.582e-25: 1.98e9 * 6.582e-25 = approx 1.305e-15.

Divide by 0.32: 1.305e-15 / 0.32 ≈ 4.078e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.078e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-
