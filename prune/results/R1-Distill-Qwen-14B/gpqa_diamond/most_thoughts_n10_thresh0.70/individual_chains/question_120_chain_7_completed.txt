Okay, so I've got this question here about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of how much a star shifts its position in the sky relative to background stars as we orbit the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance to a star (in parsecs) is 1 divided by its parallax (in arcseconds). So, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. That makes sense—closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax change. So if I consider a range of parallax values, how does the count of stars in each range depend on plx?

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. I think that means the actual number density of stars in space is uniform. So the number of stars depends on how much volume you're looking at. But since we're dealing with parallax, which relates to distance, I need to think about how volume relates to parallax.

Let me get the relation right. Parallax plx = 1 / distance (d). So d = 1 / plx. But distances in three dimensions. So for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Wait, if plx = 1/d, then higher plx means closer. So a small plx means a larger distance. Let me think about the distance ranges. For a small change in plx, say dplx, how does that translate to the change in distance, dd?

Taking derivative: d(plx) = -d(d)/d^2, because plx = 1/d. So d(d) = -d^2 * d(plx). But since plx is a small change, I can think that the change in distance is inversely proportional to d squared, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. So if I have a shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is 4πd² dd. Since the star density is uniform, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to d² dd.

But how does that translate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, d =1/plx. So let's substitute d with 1/plx. Then, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd. But dd is the change in distance, which we can relate to the change in parallax dplx.

Earlier, from plx = 1/d, taking differentials: d(plx) = -1/d² dd. So d(plx) = - (plx)^2 dd. Because d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². So, d(plx) = - plx² dd → dd = -d(plx) / plx².

Wait, but when plx increases (i.e., when you go to a smaller plx), the distance d decreases. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think in terms of a small range of plx. For each plx, the corresponding distance is d = 1/plx. So the thickness in distance, dd, corresponding to a change in plx, dplx, is given by:

dd = (d/dplx) dplx = ( -1 / plx² ) dplx.

But since we're dealing with absolute numbers, perhaps the sign doesn't matter. So the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) * (because d is 1/plx, so dd is d plx * -1/plx², but I'm taking absolute value here).

Wait, wait. Let me re-express that. The volume of the shell at distance d, with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So substituting d =1/plx, and dd from above.

From plx =1/d → d =1/plx → derivative: d(plx) = -d/d² → d(plx) = - d² dd → dd = -d² d(plx) → but d is 1/plx, so dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx).

So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² d(plx) ). The negative sign indicates direction but since we're considering a small increment, the magnitude is positive. So volume is 4π (1/plx^4) d(plx).

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, plugging in, d is 1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx². And dd is ( -1/plx² ) d(plx). So the volume is 4π (1/plx^2) * ( -1/plx² d(plx) ) → 4π (-1/plx^4) d(plx). The negative indicates that if plx increases, the distance decreases, but the volume is positive. So the absolute value is 4π (1/plx^4) d(plx).

But wait, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So the number of stars per unit parallax (d plx) is proportional to (1/plx^4).

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if the number is proportional to (1/plx^4) * d plx, then the number per unit d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that seems to suggest the number decreases as plx increases, but that's not matching my initial intuition. Because if parallax increases (so stars are closer), but if they're uniformly distributed, closer stars would be more in number?

Wait a second, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about it again.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume and the density.

But when considering parallax, each unit of plx corresponds to a shell. As the parallax decreases, the distance increases, so the shell is farther away.

At a certain distance d (plx =1/d), the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd, which is the volume element. But as d increases, the volume of the shell increases (since it's proportional to d²). So, for a fixed change in distance (dd), as d increases, the volume increases.

But in terms of parallax, for a fixed d plx, the corresponding change in d (dd) is smaller when plx is larger. Because plx is inversely proportional to d, so when plx is small (d is large), a given d plx corresponds to a much smaller dd.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between how the volume relates to plx. Let me try to approach it differently.

Number density n is constant. The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dd is n * 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx, where plx = 1/d, so d =1/plx. So:

Number of stars = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But dd is the change in distance, which for a given d plx is:

dd = (d plx) * (dd/plx d plx).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express dd in terms of d plx.

From plx = 1/d → d plx = -1/(d^2) dd → rearranged, dd = -d^2 d plx.

But d is 1/plx, so dd = -(1/plx)^2 d plx.

Substituting back into the number of stars:

n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (-(1/plx)^2 d plx )

The negative sign is because when plx increases, d decreases, but for the count, we take the absolute value.

So the number of stars is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d plx → 1/plx^4 d plx.

So the number of stars per unit change in plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that can't be right because when plx increases (i.e., closer stars), you'd expect more stars in a given plx range, not fewer. Because closer stars are more, but the volume per plx unit is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check.

Volume of shell at distance d: 4π d² dd.

In terms of plx, d =1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So substituting, Volume =4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² d plx ) → 4π (-1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars is n * volume, which is n *4π ( -1/plx^4 ) d plx.

But the number can't be negative, so we take the absolute value: number = n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Therefore, number of stars in a plx range d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So as plx increases (i.e., stars are closer), 1/plx^4 decreases. That would mean fewer stars per unit plx range, but that seems counterintuitive. Because closer stars should have more in a given range.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It's asking how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So if plx is increasing, the number of stars (per unit plx) is decreasing.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for a small plx (large d), the volume of the shell is larger. So for a given d plx, the corresponding dd is smaller. But the shell at larger d has a larger volume, so the number of stars in that shell (per d plx) is higher.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is in how the number is per unit plx. Let's think in terms of the function N(plx) = number of stars per unit plx.

So N(plx) d plx = number of stars between plx and plx + d plx.

Earlier, we found that N(plx) d plx = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx → so N(plx) = 4π n / plx^4.

So as plx increases, N(plx) decreases. So the number of stars per unit plx range goes down as plx increases.

But wait, if you have more stars in the vicinity (closer stars), but each unit of plx is a smaller volume, so the number of stars per unit plx might decrease. Hmm.

Wait, let's think with an example. Suppose plx is small (like 0.01 arcsec), which means the star is very far (d=100 pc). A change in plx of, say, 0.01 to 0.02 is a big change in distance? Or a small one.

Wait, plx =1/d. So when plx is 0.01, d=100. When plx is 0.02, d=50. So a change in plx from 0.01 to 0.02 corresponds to a change in d from 100 to 50, which is a significant change. But the volume of the shell at d=100, thickness 50 (from 50 to 100) is 4π*(100)^2 *50. That's a big volume. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 100² *50 = 5e5. 

But when plx is 1 (d=1 pc), a change of 1 to 2 (d from 1 to 0.5) would correspond to a shell of thickness 0.5 pc. The volume is 4π*(1)^2 *0.5 = 2π. So the number of stars would be proportional to 2π.

Wait, but N(plx) is the number per unit plx. So for plx=0.01, d plx=0.01. The shell volume is 4π (100)^2 * (1/(0.01^2)) * 0.01? I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, let's compute the number of stars per unit plx (d plx=1). Wait, plx can't be 100, that's impossible. Oh wait, plx is in arcseconds, and the maximum useful parallax is about 0.0x because beyond that, the stars are too far to have measurable parallax.

But perhaps the key is that the number of stars per unit plx decreases as plx increases. Because as you look closer (higher plx), the same plx range corresponds to a much smaller volume.

Wait, for plx = 1, a d plx of 1 would mean d changes from 1 to 0 (but that's impossible, so perhaps this is an edge case). Maybe I should think of small d plx.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx is proportional to the volume between those distances.

The number is proportional to the integral of 4π d² dd from d=1/(plx +d plx) to d=1/plx.

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me switch variables to plx. So d =1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So the integral becomes:

N = n * 4π ∫ (from plx to plx +d plx) (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx^2) )

Wait, that makes N = n *4π * ∫ (1/plx^4) d plx.

So for a small d plx, N ≈ n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number per unit plx decreases as plx increases.

But wait, that seems to suggest that as you look at closer stars (higher plx), there are fewer stars per unit plx range. That's counterintuitive because I thought closer stars are more densely populated.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the wrong end. Let me think differently: the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So for a given volume, you get a certain number of stars.

But how does the volume per unit plx change with plx?

Parallax plx = 1/d.

The volume of a thin shell at d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx: d=1/plx → dd = - d² d plx = - (1/plx^2) d plx.

So the volume is 4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx ) ).

Which simplifies to 4π ( -1/plx^4 ) d plx.

Wait, I'm getting the same result again. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So as plx increases, the number decreases. But that seems to suggest that when you look closer (higher plx), you have fewer stars in each plx bin. That doesn't feel right.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many stars are in a range of plx. For example, the number of stars with plx between P and P+dP.

The distance ranges from d =1/P to d=1/(P + dP).

Wait, but for small dP, 1/(P + dP) ≈ 1/P - dP/(P^2).

So the distance range is from 1/P to 1/P - dP/(P^2). So the thickness in distance is dP/(P^2) * (1/(1/(P^2)) )) → wait, perhaps better to compute the shell volume.

The shell volume would be 4π (d)^2 * (d d). Here, d is around 1/P.

But the change in d is dd = (d dP) → wait, no. Let me express d in terms of P.

d =1/P → dP = -d² dd → dd = -d² dP.

If dP is small, then the volume element is dV =4π d^2 dd =4π d^2 (-d^2 dP ) = -4π d^4 dP.

But d=1/P → dV= -4π (1/P^4) dP.

The negative sign indicates that as P increases, d decreases. So the number of stars in this volume is n * dV, which is n * (-4π (1/P^4) dP ). Taking the absolute value, it's n*4π (1/P^4) dP.

So the number per unit dP is proportional to 1/P^4.

That would mean that as P increases, the number per unit P decreases. So higher P, fewer stars per unit P.

But why does this happen? Because as you go to higher P (closer stars), each unit of P corresponds to a much larger change in distance. Wait, no, because P is inversely proportional to d. So for a fixed dP, the corresponding dd is smaller when P is larger.

Wait, perhaps it's better to visualize:

Imagine P is 1 (d=1), so a change in P of 1 (from 1 to 2) would mean d goes from 1 to 0.5. The volume between d=0.5 and d=1 is a shell with volume 4π*(1^2 -0.5^2)* (1-0.5) → wait no, shell volume is 4π d^2 dd. For a range d to d+dd, it's 4π d^2 dd.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the volume per unit P.

When P is small (d is large), a small change in P corresponds to a small change in d. Because P =1/d → dP = -d² dd → dd= -d² dP → for small dP, the corresponding dd is proportional to d². So for large d (small P), a given dP corresponds to a small dd.

So the shell volume is 4π d² dd =4π d² (d² dP) )=4π d^4 dP.

But d=1/P → d^4 = (1/P)^4 → 4π (1/P^4) dP.

So, the number of stars is proportional to (1/P^4) dP. So per unit dP, the number is 1/P^4.

Therefore, as P increases (d decreases), 1/P^4 decreases. So the number of stars per unit P decreases.

But this implies that closer stars (higher P) are fewer in number per unit P. That doesn't align with my expectation because I thought closer stars are more in number.

Ah, wait! Wait a minute. The volume per unit P is inversely proportional to P^4. So for a given P, a unit change in P corresponds to a volume that's proportional to 1/P^4.

But if the star density is uniform, the number of stars is proportional to the volume. So as P increases, the volume per unit P (and hence the number of stars per unit P) decreases.

So even though the stars are closer (higher P), the number of stars per unit P decreases because each unit of P encompasses a much smaller volume. 

Wait, this seems a bit clearer. Let's imagine two ranges: P=1 and P=2.

At P=1, a change of 1 in P (unit P) would correspond to a much larger volume than at P=2. So the number of stars in that range would be higher for lower P (since more volume). Thus, the number per unit P is higher for lower P.

So, the number per unit P is proportional to 1/P^4. So at P=1, it's 1, at P=2 it's 1/16, etc. So as P increases, the number per unit P drops.

So the correct answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) ~1/plx^4

B) ~1/plx^2

C) ~1/plx^1

D) ~1/plx^3

So the correct answer should be A.

But I'm a bit puzzled because in reality, the number of stars with larger parallax (closer) should be more, but per unit parallax, it's less. Because the same number of stars would require a smaller parallax range as you go closer.

Wait, another way: For a given volume, the number of stars is n * volume. So if you go closer (higher P), each unit of P corresponds to a much smaller volume, so fewer stars per unit P.

Yes, that makes sense. So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}.
\]

The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume and the uniform number density of stars. For a thin shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(dd\), the volume is:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi d^2 dd.
\]

Expressing this in terms of parallax (\(d = 1/\text{plx}\)) and differentiating \(d = 1/\text{plx}\), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}).
\]

Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\) and \(dd = -1/\text{plx}^2 d(\text{plx})\) into the volume expression, the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx})\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx}).
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\(d(\text{plx})\)) is:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit } d(\text{plx}) \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This result shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\text{plx}\) increases. This makes sense because, at larger distances (smaller \(\text{plx}\)), the volume corresponding to a given range of \(\text{plx}\) is larger, leading to more stars per unit \(\text{plx}\). Conversely, at smaller distances (larger \(\text{plx}\)), the volume corresponding to a given range of \(\text{plx}\) is smaller, resulting in fewer stars per unit \(\text{plx}\).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \(1/\text{plx}^4\).

**Answer: A**
