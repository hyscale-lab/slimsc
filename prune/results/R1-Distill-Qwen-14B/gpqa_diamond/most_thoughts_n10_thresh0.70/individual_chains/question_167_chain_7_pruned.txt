Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the amount of non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are easier to handle.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) divided by N. N is the normalization constant, and it's provided as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). So I think N ensures that the state is normalized, so that the probabilities add up correctly.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.

Wait, relative entropy is like the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two states, right? So here, it's the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state rho and the Gaussian state tau. But wait, the formula subtracts the trace of tau ln tau from rho's. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy.

But wait, the relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Oh, but in this case, the given formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's different. So it's not the standard relative entropy, but the difference between the entropies of rho and tau.

Wait, why is that? Maybe because the reference Gaussian state is some specific state, like maybe a thermal state or coherent state, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the formula is given, so I should proceed with that.

So, the non-Gaussianity nG is calculated as this del_b. To compute this, I need to find the entropy
