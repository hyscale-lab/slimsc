Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible choices for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism usually involves the formation of an enol or enolate, allowing the CN- to attack. But wait, the product here is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Oh right, that's the addition of cyanide to a ketone. The product is a cyanohydrin. So the first part is forming a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one.

But wait, how does that happen? The ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with NaCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh right, because the cyanide ion is a nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl. But the reaction typically requires an acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. So reagent A would probably be an acid, like H3O+ or maybe another acid.

Looking at the options, A options are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Or maybe it's acting as a base? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, sometimes in such reactions, H+ from an acid is used to protonate the carbonyl.

So the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + acid (H3O+) â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense because the acid provides the H+ needed for the reaction.

Now the second reaction: the cyanohydrin (with a benzyl group) is treated with B (which is H2O) and it becomes a carboxylic acid. Wait, how? So the product is 2-(4
