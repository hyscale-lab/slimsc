Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think about the information given.

First, I remember that both instruments have different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17, and HIRES can go up to 16. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude better than both. Wait, no—wait, the question says with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So ESPRESSO can see down to 17, meaning it can't see fainter than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so it can't see beyond 16. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be seen by both because HIRES can't go beyond 16. Because if a star is 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤16 for both.

But wait, I should consider whether each star is observed in the V band, and whether any extinction (dust) affects their apparent magnitudes. Because some stars have E(B-V) given, and that affects their observed magnitude.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V mag is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. d=10, log10(10)=1. So m=15.5 +5(1) -5=15.5+5-5=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Which is below 16. So both ESPRESSO (which goes to 17) and HIRES (which goes to 16) can detect it. Wait but HIRES can only go up to 16, so 15.5 is okay. So Star1 is detectable by both. Wait, but wait, the apparent magnitude for detection is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, but Star1 is 15.5, which is brighter than 1
