Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let's see. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning it can see stars up to 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so up to 16 mag. So, a star needs to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. So, that means ESPRESSO can see stars down to 17 mag, right? Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So, for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag <= 17 is observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag <=16. So, a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. So, to be detectable by both, the star's apparent V mag must be <=16 because that's the lower (brighter) limit for HIRES, and since 16 is less than 17, it's within ESPRESSO's limit too.

Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Oh wait, wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would be an apparent magnitude less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, the limit is apparent V mag ≤17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16.

So, for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V mag ≤16 because that's the stricter condition. So any star that is dimmer than 16 (i.e., apparent mag >16) would not be observable by HIRES. So, the stars must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Now, let's look at each star's apparent magnitude, considering any extinction (dust) which affects
