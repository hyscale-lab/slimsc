Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name for a given benzene ring structure. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, meta positions are two carbons apart. Let me imagine the benzene ring with three substituents: COOH (carboxylic acid), CHO (carbaldehyde), and CN (cyano). They are all meta, meaning each is two positions away from each other. Hmm, wait, wait. Actually, in a benzene ring, meta means that each substituent is positioned two carbons apart. So if one substituent is in position 1, the others would be in 3 and 5. But wait, the problem says all three are meta to one another. That might not be possible because in benzene, each substituent can have two meta positions, but getting three substituents all in meta positions is tricky. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the three substituents are each meta relative to each other. Like, each is two positions away from the others. But that might form a symmetrical structure. Let me think: positions 1, 3, and 5 are all meta relative to each other. So if one substituent is at position 1, another at 3, and another at 5, each is two positions apart. That makes sense. So, the COOH, CHO, and CN are at 1,3,5 positions.

Wait, but the question continues. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. So, the COOH is at position 1. Then, ortho to it would be
