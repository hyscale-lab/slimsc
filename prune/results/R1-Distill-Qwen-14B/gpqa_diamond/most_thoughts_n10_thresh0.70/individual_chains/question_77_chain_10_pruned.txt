Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. I need to figure out the major products A and B from the given reactions and choose the correct option from A to D. Let me think through this step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi and then H+. Hmm, BuLi is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something. Wait, I remember that when enol ethers are treated with a strong base like BuLi, it can lead to a conjugate addition or maybe some kind of elimination. Oh, but wait, another possibility: the Cope elimination? Or perhaps a Claisen-type rearrangement. Wait, but the molecule has an enol ether structure.

Let me draw the structure. The benzene ring has a substituent that's (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl group. So, the substituent is OCH2CH2C(=CH2)CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy, which would be O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, no, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. But butenyl is four carbons. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2? No, wait. The structure of but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, the substituent is attached via the 1-position. So, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2-, but wait, that's four carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, perhaps 3-methylbut-2-en
