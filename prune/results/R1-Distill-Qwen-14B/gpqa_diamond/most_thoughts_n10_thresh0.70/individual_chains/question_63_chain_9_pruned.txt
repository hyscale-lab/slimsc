Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when it's in the fundamental state. 

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, a diatomic molecule can absorb a photon that changes its vibrational and rotational states. But wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." I think that means the molecule should transition to the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited vibrational state. But wait, maybe it's considering both rotational and vibrational changes. Because in the quantum models, transitions can involve both.

But the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the state where both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their lowest. So for vibration, the ground state is n=0, and for rotation, it's l=0. When it absorbs a photon, it can transition to higher energy states. But the question is about the lowest possible energy next state. So maybe it's the first excited state of vibration, but perhaps also considering the rotation.

Wait, the problem is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would have the smallest possible increase in energy. That would likely be the first vibrational excited state, because the vibrational energy levels are more spaced
