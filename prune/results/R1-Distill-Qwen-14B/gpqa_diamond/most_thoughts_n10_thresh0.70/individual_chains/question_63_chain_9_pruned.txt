Okay, so I've got this question here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I guess the photon must supply the right amount of energy to make that transition.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s. Wait, I remember that in these models, the energy levels depend on both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because photon momentum p is related to its energy. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, and momentum p = E/c = h/(λ). Alternatively, p = (h f)/c, but I might have to think in terms of frequency or wavelength. But in this case, perhaps we need to find the energy difference between two states and then find the corresponding momentum.

So first, what's the transition happening here? The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think that usually, the fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational level, which is n=0. But wait, the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, so perhaps it's a combination of rotational and vibrational energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is
