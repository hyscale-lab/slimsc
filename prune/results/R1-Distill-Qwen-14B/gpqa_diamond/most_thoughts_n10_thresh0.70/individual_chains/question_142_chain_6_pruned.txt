Okay, so I've got this question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this must represent a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, what's the geometrical position in qubit space? Oh right, I think for a single qubit, the state can be visualized in a 3D space using the Bloch sphere. Each point on the Bloch sphere corresponds to a quantum state. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

So, each qubit state can be represented as a vector r = (x, y, z), with the condition that x² + y² + z² ≤ 1. For a pure state |ψ> = α|0> + β|1>, the Bloch vector is (2 Re(αβ*), 2 Im(αβ*), |α|² - |β|²). But wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me get that straight. Oh right, the Bloch vector is (2 Re(αβ*), 2 Im(αβ*), |α|² - |β|²). Or wait, no, maybe it's (2 Re(α β* ), 2 Im(α β* ), |α|^2 - |β|^2). Or perhaps I'm mixing up the components. Alternatively, another approach: The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices.

The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a 3D vector. So if I can express ρ in that form, then r will be the vector we're looking for.

Let me compute that. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is the outer product, which in matrix form is [[1, 0], [0, 0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]. So adding them gives [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which is the identity matrix. Then ρ is (1/2) I. So ρ = I/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So setting ρ equal to I/2, that implies that r·σ must be zero, because I/2 = (I + 0)/2. So r·σ = 0. Therefore, r must be the zero vector.

So the vector r is (0, 0, 0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but another way to think about it: since the state is a completely mixed state, it's maximally uncertain. On the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the origin because it has zero coherence and equal probabilities for |0
