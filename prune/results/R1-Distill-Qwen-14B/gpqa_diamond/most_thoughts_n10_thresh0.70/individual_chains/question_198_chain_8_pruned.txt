Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

We're asked to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The options are A) 42.3%, B) 25.6%, C) 38.1%, D) 16.9%.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants are used in the formation of complexes. The higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex is. So the highest β here is 63 (β3), which corresponds to Co(SCN)_3^2+ I think.

Wait, wait. Wait, the question is about dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, right? So that's Co(SCN)_2^2+. So the stability constant for that would be β2, which is 40.

Wait, but the problem specifies blue dithiocyanato complexes. I'm a bit unsure about which complex is blue. I think the different complexes have different colors, but I'm not exactly sure which one is which. Oh wait, I remember that Co with different SCN counts has different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is usually blue, but wait, in the given β values, β4 is 16. So [Co(SCN)_4]^3- would have β4 =16? Or am I mixing that up.

Wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{n}, where n is the charge. But I'm not sure about the charge. Let's think. Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So two SCN would make it +0? Wait, wait. Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or maybe it
