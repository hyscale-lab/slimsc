Okay, so I'm trying to solve this particle physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to choose which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson depends on the interaction terms in the Lagrangian and the masses of the particles involved. So, the first thing I should do is figure out what particles the boson X can decay into based on the Lagrangian.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it seems to involve a term with ψ_f, which indicates that X interacts with fermions. The interaction term is λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). So X couples to fermions ψ_f with a Yukawa coupling.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is written as -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, I see, that's probably the Yukawa interaction. The term υ would be the vacuum expectation value (VEV), which for the Higgs is about 246 GeV. But X is a boson, so maybe it's a scalar field like the Higgs, but here it's X.

So the interaction Lagrangian term is λ X \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f. This suggests that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the possible decay products are any fermions that X can couple to.

Now, the problem is what fermions are available. Let's list the known fermions:

Leptons:
- e (electron)
- μ (muon)
- τ (tau)
- neutrinos (ν_e, ν_μ, ν_τ)

Quarks:
- u, d (up and down)
- c, s (charm and strange)
- t, b (top and bottom)

The top quark is really heavy, around 173 GeV, so the mass of X is 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 6 GeV is less than the mass of a top quark. So any decay into t t-bar would require X's mass to be at least twice the top mass, which isn't the case here. So t t-bar is out.

Wait, but we're looking at the fermions that X can couple to. So the Yukawa coupling term is λ X \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion that has this coupling. So the types of fermions ψ_f can be any of the fermions, but their masses must be less than X's mass divided by 2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for a fermion f, the mass of the fermion has to be less than or equal to 6 GeV/2 = 3 GeV. Because to produce a pair, the rest mass energy required is 2
