Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon, the spin operator components are given by P_x, P_y, and P_z. The general form of the spin operator in an arbitrary direction n is the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the direction vector times ħ/2. So the operator P would be P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) · n_hat, where n_hat is the unit vector in the direction of n.

But wait, the problem gives each component of P as a 2x2 matrix. So I should probably write each of them. Let me jot them down.

P_x is ħ/2 times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. P_y is ħ/2 times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. P_z is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yeah, these are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the unit vector n_hat is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

So the operator P along n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding n_hat component. So mathematically, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Substituting the n_hat components, P = sinθ * P_x + 0 * P_y + cosθ * P_z.

Wait, but since n is in the x-z plane, yes, n_y is zero. So that simplifies things a bit.

Let me compute each term:

First, sinθ * P_x. P_x is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], but wait, no, actually each P component is multiplied by 1/2 ħ, so let me re-express them.

Wait, correct, P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by sinθ, it becomes (ħ/2) sinθ [[0,1],[1,0]].

Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by cosθ gives (ħ/2) cosθ [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Adding them together, the full operator P along n is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me compute each element. The diagonal elements are (ħ/2 cosθ) and (ħ/2 (-cosθ)), because from P_z. The off-diagonal elements are (ħ/2 sinθ) in both positions because P_x contributes ±1 in the off-diagonals
