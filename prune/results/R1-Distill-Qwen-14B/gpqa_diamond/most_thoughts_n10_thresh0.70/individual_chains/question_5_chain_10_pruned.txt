Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. They've given the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices each multiplied by ħ/2. And the question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So first, I remember that for a quantum mechanical operator, the eigenvectors correspond to the possible states when the operator is measured. The eigenvalue tells us the result of that measurement.

Given that the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the direction vector n would have components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane (so ny is zero). Wait, but the operator P is presumably the projection operator along this direction, combining the components in x, y, z.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The operator P is given for each component, but the total operator along an arbitrary direction would be the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction components. So the operator P_total would be P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P_total = nx Px + nz Pz.

But wait, the problem says 'operator P along an arbitrary direction n', so the operator is the sum of the components scaled by the direction. Right.

But the problem states that we're to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector of P which has eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, no. Let me think carefully. The operator P is given as the components in x, y, z. But if the direction is arbitrary, the operator along n is a combination of these. So perhaps the operator in question is P = nx Px + nz Pz (since ny=0).

So the operator we're considering is P = nx (Px) + nz (Pz), where each component is multiplied by ħ
