Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. 

The question says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we're told about the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution.

Hmm, orthophosphate ions are HPO4^3-, right? So, I need to find [HPO4^3-] in the solution. 

First, I think this is a buffer solution problem because we have two different phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is the diprotic form, and Na2HPO4 is the sodium salt of the hydrogen phosphate. So, when dissolved in water, these salts will dissociate into their ions.

Let me write down what each salt dissociates into. 

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na is +1, each Na contributes, and the HPO4^2- is the ion. But wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the anion is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the concentration of orthophosphate. Oh wait, no, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. Let me recall: H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. The first dissociation gives H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second gives HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third gives PO4^3- (Ka3). So, orthophosphate usually refers to HPO4^2-.

But the question specifically says orthophosphate ions, so that's [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but let me make sure. So, when you have H3PO4, the first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second gives HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third gives PO4^3- (Ka3). So, the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, sometimes people refer to HPO4^3- as orthophosphate. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think: orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the ions are H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). So, orthophosphate would be HPO4^2-? Or do they mean PO4^3-?

Wait, I'm a bit uncertain. Oh well, perhaps I should proceed with the problem and see what comes up.

So, the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. These two are the conjugate acid and base of the same phosphate species. That is, KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (which can act as an acid by losing another proton to become HPO4^2
