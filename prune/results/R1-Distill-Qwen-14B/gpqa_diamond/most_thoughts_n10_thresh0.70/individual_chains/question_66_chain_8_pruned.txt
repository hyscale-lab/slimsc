Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators in SMEFT must obey the same symmetries as the Standard Model.

Wait, what symmetries does the Standard Model have? The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations; it includes momentum conservation and is connected to the invariance under shifting space and time. So if an operator respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Or are they separate?

I think Lorentz symmetry is a part of Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz transformations plus translations. So if an operator respects Lorentz, it doesn't necessarily mean it respects Poincare unless it also deals with translational invariance. Wait, but operators in the SMEFT are built from the Standard Model fields, which are Poincare invariant. So maybe SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model isn't symmetric under CP because of certain processes like kaon mixing. So does SMEFT respect CP? Well, the operators in SMEFT are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. Since the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry as a fundamental symmetry (except in some sectors), SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect CP. So some operators might violate CP, but they don't have to respect it. So CP symmetry isn't a must for all operators. So option 3 is probably not required.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. Because any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT. So since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. So operator must respect CPT.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? They must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). But wait, earlier I
