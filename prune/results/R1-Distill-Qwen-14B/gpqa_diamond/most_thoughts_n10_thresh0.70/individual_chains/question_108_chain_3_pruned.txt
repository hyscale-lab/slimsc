Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think refers to the z-axis. The field has a strength of 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong magnetic field, I believe. Oh wait, but wait, 1 Tesla is actually a large value for certain applications, but maybe not in this context. Anyway, the problem mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. So m is small, perhaps close to zero.

I remember that in hydrogen-like atoms, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the principal quantum number n and the azimuthal (or orbital) quantum number l. The magnetic quantum number m comes into play when there's a magnetic field applied, right? So in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split due to the Zeeman effect.

The paramagnetic coupling term... I think that's the term in the Hamiltonian that comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment is given by the Bohr magneton, μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), but I might be mixing terms here.

The transition energy ΔE refers to the energy difference between two atomic energy levels. For hydrogen, the Balmer series has transitions where the wavelength is around 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer-alpha line. That corresponds to a transition from n=2 to n=3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Balmer series is when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to n=2. The wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers is the H-alpha line, which is n=3 to n=2. So the energy difference ΔE is the energy difference between these two levels.

So first, I need to compute the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term and compare it to ΔE.

The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is H' = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (μ_B) m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, no, that's not quite right. The orbital magnetic moment is μ = mμ_B,
