Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator is a common problem in quantum mechanics. In three dimensions, especially when it's isotropic, the potential depends only on the radial distance r. 

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm. Right, in quantum mechanics, each state is described by a set of quantum numbers. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, but wait, no, in 3D, especially when it's isotropic, the energy is the same for states that have the same total energy quantum number. 

Wait, what's the setup here? Let me think. In three dimensions, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator can be written as E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the total number of quanta. Wait, no, wait. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, each direction contributes a (n_i + 1/2) ħω term, where n_i is the quantum number for each direction (x, y, z). So the total energy is E = ħω ( (n_x + n_y + n_z) + 3/2 ). So n = n_x + n_y + n_z is the sum of the quantum numbers. 

So the energy levels are quantized and depend on this sum. The energy for a given n is E = ħω (n + 3/2). So the ground state is when n=0, E=3/2 ħω. The first excited state would be when n=1, so E=5/2 ħω, and so on.

Wait, but what about the third excited state? Oh,
