Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and its photons have really low energy. The question is about when high-energy gamma rays interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I think this process is called photon-photon annihilation or something like that.

The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. Oh right, so if the gamma rays are too high energy, they might annihilate too quickly, so their lifetime before annihilation is what determines how far they can travel or something like that. So we're looking for the energy where this annihilation becomes significant enough to limit their lifetime.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's 0.001 eV. So the typical CMB photon is really low energy. Now, the gamma-ray's energy is way higher, right? So when the gamma hits a CMB photon, they annihilate into e+ e- pairs.

I think the cross-section for this process might depend on the energies of the two photons involved. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of the interaction happening. For two photons with energies E1 and E2, there's probably some formula for the cross-section.

Wait, I remember something about photon-photon annihilation cross-section scaling with the square of the energy or something. Or maybe the cross-section increases with the energy. Also, the process is more likely when the center-of-mass energy is above a certain threshold. For e+ e- pair production, the threshold is when the combined energy equals the rest mass energy of the electron, which is about 2*0.511 MeV, so around 1.022 MeV.

So the threshold occurs when the sum of the two photon energies is at least 1.022 MeV. But wait, in the frame where the two photons are moving towards each other, their energies add up. So for high-energy gamma-rays (E_gamma) and low-energy CMB photons (E_cmb), when E_gamma + E_cmb >= 2 m_e c^2, the annihilation can happen.

But wait, in the lab frame, the CMB photon has energy E_cmb ≈ k_B*T ≈ 0.001 eV, which is way below 1 MeV. The gamma-ray has higher energy. So the process becomes possible when E_gamma is above a certain value.

Wait, but the cross-section also depends on the gamma-ray's energy relative to the CMB. Let me think. The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation is given by sigma ~ (E_cm^2) / m_e^2, where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. But I'm not exactly sure; maybe I should look up the formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the optical depth tau is the product of the cross-section and the number density of the target photons. The optical depth determines the probability that a photon will annihilate. For a gamma-ray traveling through a medium, if tau is
