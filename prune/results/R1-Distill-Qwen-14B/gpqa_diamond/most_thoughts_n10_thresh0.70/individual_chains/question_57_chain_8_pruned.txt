Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The given data points are the phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄, each at different angles, I suppose. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm.

Wait, elastic scattering usually refers to collisions where the kinetic energy is conserved and the particles don't lose energy. But phase shifts are part of the scattering amplitude in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written in terms of the partial waves and their phase shifts.

The formula, I recall, is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] ) / ( (1 - cosθ) ), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, no, that's the expression for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves. Let me get this right.

Each partial wave contributes a term to the scattering amplitude. The phase shift δ_l for each orbital angular momentum l. So the total scattering amplitude f(θ) would be the sum over all l of [ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ) * (something) ].

Wait, no, wait. The standard formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) / (something with cosθ?), no wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = Σ [ ( (2l + 1) / (2ik) ) * ( e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ) / ( sin( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) ) ) ]

But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude that's being asked. Oh, the question specifies the imaginary part along the incident direction. Wait, the incident direction is θ=0, right? Because when θ is zero, the electron is scattered along the same direction as the incoming beam.

So for θ=0, the expression for f(θ) might simplify. Let's think
