Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The answer should be up to one decimal place, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the expectation value of an operator gives the average measurement of that observable over many measurements on the same state. So for a given state |ψ⟩, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz + 5σx. Let me break this down. The expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term. So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, right, because expectation values are linear. So I can compute each part separately.

First, let me find the expectation value of σz. Since the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write the state as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is typically (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1) in the computational basis, the state vector would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, but I think another approach is to compute ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩. Since σz is diagonal in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

The probability of measuring spin-up is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of spin-down is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So the expectation value of σz is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is not diagonal in the σz basis. So I can't directly compute it like σz. Instead, I think I need to express σx in terms of the given basis states or compute the expectation value directly using the state.

Wait, σx has the matrix form [[0,1],[1,0]]. So for a state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(Re(ab*)) because σx swaps the states.

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, I can compute it
