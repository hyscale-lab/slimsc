Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I remember eigenvectors are vectors that only get scaled by the operator, right? So the operator in question is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as ħ/2 multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. I think I need to find the overall operator P first. Oh wait, because the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the operator P would be the component in the direction of n. So, the operator can be written as P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

Let me write down the matrices for each component. 

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. 
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]. 
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

Since n is in the x-z plane, let's define n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because polar coordinates where θ is the angle from z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. 

So the operator P becomes: 
P = (sinθ) * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ) * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix. 

First component: sinθ*(ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, sinθ*(ħ/2)], [sinθ*(ħ/2), 0]].
Second component: cosθ*(ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[cosθ*(ħ/2), 0], [0, -cosθ*(ħ/2)]].

Adding these together, the matrix P is:

[ [cosθ*(ħ/2), sinθ*(ħ/2) ],
  [sinθ*(ħ/2), -cosθ*(ħ/2) ] ]

So the matrix P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, because the second element in the second row comes from adding sinθ*(ħ/2) (from P_x) to -cosθ*(ħ/2) (from P_z). So the complete matrix is:

Row 1: [ (ħ/2) cosθ, (ħ/2) sinθ ]
Row 2: [ (ħ/2) sinθ, -(ħ/2) cosθ ]

So that's the operator matrix for P.

Now, since we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, we can set up the eigenvalue equation: P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me represent the eigenvector as |ψ> = [a, b]^T.

The eigenvalue equation is:

( (ħ/2) cosθ ) a + ( (ħ/2) sinθ ) b = (ħ/2) a
( (ħ/2) sinθ ) a + ( -(ħ/2) cosθ ) b = (ħ/2) b

Wait, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So let me write the equations:

Equation 1: (ħ/2 cosθ) a + (ħ/2 sinθ) b = (ħ/2) a
Equation 2: (ħ/2 sinθ) a - (ħ/2 cosθ) b = (ħ/2) b

We can divide both equations by ħ/2 to simplify.

Equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a
Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange these.

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Hmm, so we have two equations:

(1): (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0
(2): sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0

I can write these as a system:

[(cosθ -1)   sinθ      ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ      -(cosθ +1) ] [b]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant must be zero. Let me compute the determinant.

Determinant = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - sinθ * sinθ

= [ - (cosθ -1)(cosθ + 1) ] - sin²θ
= [ - (cos²θ -1) ) ] - sin²θ
But cos²θ -1 is -sin²θ, so:

= [ - ( - sin²θ ) ] - sin²θ
= sin²θ - sin²θ = 0

So determinant is zero, which makes sense because we're looking for eigenvectors.

So the equations are dependent. Let's take equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0
=> (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b
=> a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, let's simplify sinθ/(1 - cosθ). I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] 
= cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) 
= cot(θ/2)

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Wait, but that's assuming θ is not 0, right? If θ is 0, then cosθ =1, but that would make the denominator zero. Let's proceed under the assumption θ≠0.

So the ratio a/b = cot(θ/2)

So we can set b=1 (or any constant), then a = cot(θ/2). 

So the eigenvector is [ a, b ] = [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]

But we need to normalize this vector. The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Compute |a|^2 + |b|^2:

= |cot(θ/2)|^2 + 1
= (cos^2(θ/2) / sin^2(θ/2)) + 1 
= [ cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ] / sin²(θ/2)
= 1 / sin²(θ/2)
So the normalization factor is sqrt(1 / [1/sin²(θ/2)]) ) = sin(θ/2).

Wait, wait: the sum is 1/sin²(theta/2), so the normalization factor is sqrt( sin²(theta/2) ) = |sin(theta/2)|.

Assuming theta is between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive, so the normalization factor is sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Simplify:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)
b = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The eigenvector came from equation (1), but let me also check equation (2) to see if it's consistent.

From equation (2): sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b =0

Substitute a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2):

Left side: sinθ * cos(theta/2) - (cosθ +1) sin(theta/2)

Let me compute sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So first term: 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)

Second term: (cos theta +1) sin(theta/2)

cos theta = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1, so cos theta +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2). 

So second term: 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2)

So equation becomes:

2 sin(theta/2) cos²(theta/2) - 2 cos²(theta/2) sin(theta/2) =0 

Which is 0. So it's correct.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the options are given. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the options are written as vectors, but I'm not sure about any additional factors. Let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, in my calculation, I found the normalized eigenvector as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So looking at the options, option C matches this, except that option C doesn't have any ħ factors.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P. The components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as (ħ/2) times some matrices. So the operator P is in terms of ħ, but the eigenvector itself is a vector in the Hilbert space, which is dimensionless. So the eigenvector's elements are just the coefficients, which should be dimensionless.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

That's exactly what I have.

Wait, but let me think about the operator. The operator P is expressed in terms of ħ, but the eigenvector is a vector in the space, so the components are just the coefficients, not multiplied by ħ.

So the correct answer is option C. 

Wait, but wait another thought. The operator P has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So when I set up the equation, I used the eigenvalue +ħ/2, but in the eigenvalue equation, when I divided by ħ/2, I ended up with the equations in terms of theta.

But the eigenvector itself doesn't have units of ħ; it's a pure state vector. So the answer should be option C.

Looking at the options again:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's what I have. So the answer is option C.
