Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics can be expressed in terms of their components, like P_x, P_y, P_z. 

Wait, the operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So that direction would be a unit vector, right? So n would be something like (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? Hmm, maybe just φ=0, so it's along the x-z plane, which means the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Oh wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is the angle around the z-axis. So if it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. But in this case, since the direction is arbitrary within the x-z plane, the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of θ, which is the polar angle.

But wait, how does that connect to the eigenvector? Oh right, because the operator P is along n, so the operator P can be written as ħ/2 times (n · σ), where σ are the Pauli matrices. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operator is usually S = (ħ/2)
