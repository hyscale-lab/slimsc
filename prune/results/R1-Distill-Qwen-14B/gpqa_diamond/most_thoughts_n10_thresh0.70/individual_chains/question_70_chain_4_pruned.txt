Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and see what I can deduce.

The question is about a series of reactions, and then it asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, but I'll try to think it through.

Let me break down each reaction step by step. First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggest that the molar ratio is 1:8. So maybe A is something that reacts with B in that proportion. Also, product C is bright red. I know that some compounds are bright red, like maybe something with chromium or transition metals, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. That makes me think E could be something like a toxic gas, maybe. But I'm not certain yet.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces A and two acids. Strong and weak. I think about which reactions produce multiple acids. Maybe something like the breakdown of a nitrate or sulfate ester? Or maybe something involving sulfonic acids? Wait, but if F is strong and G is weak, perhaps it's something like sulfuric acid (strong) and another weak acid. 

Wait, another possibility: when a nitrate salt is hydrolyzed, maybe it produces nitric acid (strong) and something else. Or perhaps it's related to sulfates. Hmm.

Looking at the next reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B combine to make H, a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. What's B and D? Let me think. If H is a solvent and forms from D and B in a 1:1 ratio, maybe D is something like SO3 (sulfur trioxide) and B is water. Wait, that would make H as H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), but that's a strong acid, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: think about the first reaction. A and B react to form C with 8 equivalents. Let's think about metals reacting with gases. For example, maybe A is a metal, B is a halogen. But 8 equivalents seem high. Alternatively, if A is a metal oxide and B is a halogen gas, perhaps forming a halide.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium chloride (NaCl) reacting with something. No, that doesn't make sense because 8 equivalents would imply 8 moles of B per mole of A. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal like iron, and B is chlorine gas. Iron reacts with chlorine in a certain ratio. Iron(III) chloride would be FeCl3, but that's 3 moles of Cl2 per mole of Fe. Hmm, but the problem says 8 equivalents, so that would be 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A.

Wait, wait. Maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Let's say A is Fe, and B is Cl2. The reaction could be 2Fe + 3Cl2 → 2FeCl3. That's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Fe. So per mole of Fe, 1.5 moles of Cl2. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents, so maybe a different ratio.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Na2O and B is Cl2. The reaction would be Na2O + Cl2 → NaCl + NaClO? No, that doesn't seem right. Or maybe Na2O + 2Cl2 → 2NaCl + ClO2? Hmm, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, another angle. The product C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives back A
