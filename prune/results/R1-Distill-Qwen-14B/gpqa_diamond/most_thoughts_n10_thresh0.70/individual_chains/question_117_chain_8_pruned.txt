Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question gives four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D with different combinations. I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules being non-superimposable mirror images, leading to different rotations of plane-polarized light. Let's see.

First, I think about what causes optical isomerism. The main factors are the presence of chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. If a molecule has a chiral center, it can exist as enantiomers, which are optical isomers. Also, other forms like allenes or molecules with axial chirality (like biphenyls) can exhibit optical isomerism. Oh wait, and sometimes even if there are no chiral centers, like in allenes with double bonds, the molecule can still be chiral if it has a plane of symmetry or not.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can have optical isomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. The structure here is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 2' positions, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Wait, the positions are 6,6' on the biphenyl. Let me imagine the structure. The main chain is biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Then, the substituents are at 2 and 2', which are on each benzene ring. Also, at 6 and 6' positions on each ring. 

Wait, in biphenyl systems, substituents' positions can lead to different isomerism. The 2 and 2' positions are across from the connecting point, so perhaps if the groups are not symmetrical, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry or not. Wait, the substituents here are two methyl ester groups (from the dicarboxylate) and two nitro groups. Let me think about the symmetry. Each benzene ring has a methyl ester at position 2, and a nitro at position 6. Wait, 2 and 6 are adjacent in a benzene ring? No, benzene is a six-membered ring. Position 1 is where the rings are connected. So position 2 is adjacent to 1, position 6 is across from position 1, which is the other ring. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So on each benzene, you have a methyl ester (from the 2,2' dicarboxylate) and a nitro group at 6,6'.

Wait, on each benzene ring, position 2 is adjacent to the connection point (1), and position 6 is opposite to it (since benzene is a ring). So each ring has a methyl ester at 2 and a nitro at 6. So each ring has substituents in positions 2 and 6. Are these positions equivalent in some way?

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule symmetrical, then it won't have optical isomerism. But if they're arranged asymmetrically, leading to no plane of symmetry, then they might be chiral.

Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So I'm trying to visualize
