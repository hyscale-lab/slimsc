Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about how many revolutions a proton makes after being accelerated. Let me think about what I know about synchrocyclotrons.

Wait, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The main difference is that cyclotrons use a constant magnetic field and a fixed electric field, while synchrocyclotrons vary the magnetic field over time, right? Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, synchrocyclotrons have a magnetic field that changes with time, allowing them to keep the particles in sync with the oscillating electric field as the particles gain energy. That makes sense because as the particles speed up, their orbit radius increases, so the magnetic field needs to adjust to maintain the right balance between the electric and magnetic forces.

The problem gives me that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T â‰ˆ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Hmm, maybe it's accelerated twice in each revolution? Or perhaps each half-revolution? I'm not sure, but the main point is that the proton reaches a certain kinetic energy after some number of revolutions.
