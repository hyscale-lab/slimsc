Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. The particle is in a specific superposition state, and the operator given is 10σz +5σx. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve calculating the average outcome of a measurement over many identical systems.

The state of the particle is given as a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, I should check if these coefficients are correctly normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the sum of the squares of the coefficients should equal 1 for it to be a valid state. Let's see: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them together gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So, yes, the state is correctly normalized. Good, no issues there.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. I think I should find the expectation value of each term separately and then combine them. So, the expectation value of the operator is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Let me recall, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be easier. The matrix representation of σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], right? So, σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

Since the state is a linear combination, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Wait, what's the probability here? It's the square of the coefficients.

Coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so probability is 0.25. Coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so probability is 3/4.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) . Let me compute that: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. That's -0.5. So, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Next, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx swaps the spin-up and spin-down states. The expectation value of σx is a bit trickier because it's not diagonal in the σz basis.

The general formula for the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me write down the state ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1;0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ is 0.5 [1;0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0;1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so applying σx to |ψ⟩ gives [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by σx|ψ⟩.

But since all the coefficients are real here, I can ignore the complex conjugate part. So, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Wait, let me write this out:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

Let's compute σx|ψ⟩ first. That gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then the inner product with ψ is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

So 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/4). And the same term again, so total is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait! I think I made a mistake here. Because σx is an Hermitian operator, but when you compute ⟨σx⟩, it's [a*, b*] multiplied by σx [a; b]. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.

Alternatively, another approach: ⟨σx⟩ can be calculated using the formula for expectation value in terms of the state components. Let's say the state is α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩. Then, ⟨σx⟩ is (αβ* + α*β). Because σx has off-diagonal elements in the computational basis.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The matrix elements of σx are ⟨i|σx|j⟩. So for |i⟩ and |j⟩ being |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, σx is represented as:

⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ = 0,

⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = 1,

⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ = 1,

⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ = 0.

So, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) because ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩, so α is 0.5 and β is sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the expression is ψ† σx ψ. So, in terms of α and β, that's (α* β + β* α) because σx connects |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so the terms are α β* + α* β. Hmm, no, wait. I think I got it a bit wrong.

Let me do it properly. Let me write ψ as [a, b]^T,
