Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right. The question is, what's the angle between their directions?

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since it's an electron and positron, their annihilation should result in gamma-ray photons. But in this case, they produce two photons. I think that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, the initial setup: the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their directions are opposite along the horizontal axis.

But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so it's going to the left, while the electron is moving from the left to the right. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

The Lorentz factor for the electron is 4, and for the positron it's 2. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass dilate. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for the purpose of calculating momentum, I think we need the relativistic momentum, which is gamma*m*v. So since the electron and positron have the same mass, but different gammas and velocities.

Wait, but wait, the electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? Because a positron is just the antimatter counterpart of an electron. So, same mass, but opposite charges. But in terms of momentum, since momentum is a vector, direction matters.

So let's think about the momenta before the collision.

Electron: moving to the right (let's say positive x-direction) with gamma_e =4.

Positron: moving to the left (so negative x-direction) with gamma_p=2.

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

Similarly, the momentum of the positron is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p.

But wait, since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is negative. So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p).

Wait, but for calculating total momentum, I can just sum the vectors.

Wait, but I don't know v_e and v_p. Hmm, but perhaps I can find the ratio or find a way to relate their velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express momentum in terms of gamma and the rest mass.

Wait, I remember that the relativistic momentum p is given by gamma * m * v. And the energy is gamma * m c². So, for each particle, we can find their energies and momenta.

But since the problem says
