Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry involves looking at the different symmetry elements a molecule has, like axes of rotation, planes of symmetry, etc. The symmetry group is determined by all these elements together.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so the stoichiometry here is 1 A + 8 B → C. What could this be? Well, bright red product C... wait, that makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving metals. Let me think of some common reactions.

Wait, another reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to make E, which is extremely hazardous. C also reacts with water to reform A plus two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). Oh, so when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G.

Wait, so when C is hydrolyzed, it gives a solid A and two acids. Since one acid is strong and the other is weak, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is something like H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, which is weak) or maybe H2SO4? Wait, no, H2SO4 is strong. Hmm, maybe something else. Alternatively, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is something else? Wait, I'm getting a bit off track. Let's focus on the first reaction.

So, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C. What solid reacts with 8 equivalents of a gas to make a red product. Oh! Wait, could this be the formation of a sulfide? Like, if A is FeS, but I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction like the production of a metal sulfide, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide reacting with a gas, which could be a halogen or something else.

Wait
