Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves an experiment where compound X is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. I need to figure out what compound X was from the options provided.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which is an oxidation reaction that forms epoxides from certain alkenes. So, the product here is likely an epoxide. That means compound X probably had an alkene that was epoxidized.

Looking at the options, all of them are epoxides except maybe not? Let me check. The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all these options are oxiranes, which are epoxides. So, the product is an epoxide formed from compound X, which must have been an alkene before the reaction.

Now, the NMR data is crucial. Let me look at the 1H NMR and 13C NMR.

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, there are two singlets for 3H each. These are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, maybe carbonyl groups or aromatic rings where the methyl is in a symmetric position.

Then, there are several aromatic protons. Let's see:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Hmm, the downfield shifts (like 7.68 and 7.71) suggest substitution on the aromatic ring. Let me think about coupling patterns. The two doublets each for 2H and 1H could indicate a para-substituted styryl group, perhaps with substituents.

Wait, the 1H NMR suggests a structure where there are two doublets of 2H each. Styryl groups (like in styrene) typically have two protons on the double bond. But wait, no, styrene is H2C=CHPh. So, in the epoxide, the styryl part would be part of the epoxide ring.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the 13C NMR.

13C NMR:
δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Looking at this, I see two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4. Wait, but 21.3 is a typical methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe an epoxide oxygen. Wait, but wait, epoxide carbons are usually around 60-70 ppm. Wait, no, wait: in epoxides, the carbons adjacent to the oxygen (epoxide carbons) are usually around 50-60 or so? Let me think.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon. Wait, no, epoxide carbons aren't carbonyls. Hmm, wait—epoxides are ethers, so their carbons are typically in the 50s, but I might be mixing up. Alternatively, the 197.7 could be an ester or ketone, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, maybe it's not a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps
