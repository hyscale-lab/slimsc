Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle decay. Let me see what it's about. The question is about the possible decays of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is for the interaction between the boson X and fermions.

The Lagrangian is given as L = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y) but I think I might have misread that. Wait, the actual expression is written as:

\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) ( \upsilon + X(y) ) \psi_f (y)

Hmm, wait no. Let me parse that correctly. Oh wait, it's written as:

\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi} f (y) ( \upsilon + X(y) ) \psi_{f} (y)

Wait, maybe I'm getting the variables wrong. Oh, perhaps the correct expression is that the interaction term couples the boson X to a fermion ψ_f and the coupling is proportional to λ, and involves the Yukawa term. So the term would be something like \lambda X \bar{\psi}_f \psi_f. Because the standard Yukawa coupling is like L = - g X \bar{\psi} \psi, where g is the coupling constant.

So from the Lagrangian, the interaction term is -λ X \bar{\psi}_f ψ_f. Because the ψ_f is a fermion field, and X is the boson field. So the interaction is between X and fermions.

So the X boson can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can couple to.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV, since energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass of the products cannot exceed the mass of the decaying particle.

Wait, but when a particle at rest decays, the maximum possible mass each pair can have is when they are at rest relative to each other, so each would have mass up to m_X/2. Because for a boson of mass m_X, the decay into two particles each of mass m_f would require 2
