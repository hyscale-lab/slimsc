Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: 

L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y)

Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. Oh right, I think it's supposed to be something like the interaction term involving the fermion fields ψf and the boson field X. So probably, the interaction is of the form λ times some Yukawa coupling involving X.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out what fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

First, in particle physics, a boson like X can decay into a pair of fermions (like a quark-antiquark pair or lepton-antilepton pair) if the combined rest mass of the fermions is less than the mass of X. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass of the products is less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

So, what's the mass of X? 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that has a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV is a possibility.

I should list all possible fermions and their masses. Let's recall the approximate masses of the fermions:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible, but they're not in the options.

So, for the decay X → f f̄, the sum of the fermion masses (since it's a particle and antiparticle, so 2m_f) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, no. Actually, the correct condition is whether the rest mass of the pair is less than X's mass. Since the fermion pairs are created from the X, which is at rest, the pair must have a combined invariant mass less than or equal to X's mass. So for each fermion species, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, when a boson decays into two particles, the maximum mass each can have is such that their sum is less than or equal to the mass of the boson. Because when the boson is at rest, the two particles can't have more mass than the boson itself.

But wait, in reality, when considering decay, it's more about whether each individual fermion's mass is less than half of X's mass. Because if each fermion is m, then 2m ≤ m_X → m ≤ m_X / 2.

So for X → f f̄ to be possible, m_f ≤ m_X / 2.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Let's go through each fermion:

- u quark: 2 MeV → yes
- d: ~5 MeV → yes
- s: ~100 MeV → yes
- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes, since 1.5 < 3
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 > 3 → no
- t: 173 GeV → way too big, no
- e: 0.5 MeV → yes
- mu: 105.7 MeV → yes
- tau: 1.78 GeV → yes, because 1.78 <3.

Wait, so any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can pair up.

So possible fermions are up, down, strange, charm, electron, muon, tau. But wait, wait. Wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2 * 1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into tau pairs because 2m_tau = 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 2m_f is just m_f *2, but the decay doesn't require the sum of their rest masses to be less than m_X. Because when the X is at rest, the fermions can have kinetic energy as well. Wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no, no, this is a point I
