Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think through this.

The problem says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So, they're not accelerating relative to each other. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, and we need to find how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I think I should consider the concept of time dilation here. Because if two frames are moving relative to each other, their time measurements can differ. So, the time experienced in the galaxy's frame (let's say T) and the time in the ejecta's frame (t) aren't the same.

Oh right, the time experienced by the moving clock (galaxy's frame, from the ejecta's perspective) would be longer. So, the proper time (t) is the time in the ejecta's frame, and the galaxy would see a longer time.

The time dilation formula is T = gamma * t. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, what's the velocity here? The galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the frames. The ejecta's frame: the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at the same speed, right? Because velocity is relative, but direction matters.

So, from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in 50 seconds (in the galaxy's frame). Hmm, wait, no. The question says: when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame? Wait, no, no. Wait, the question says: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

Wait, that's a bit
