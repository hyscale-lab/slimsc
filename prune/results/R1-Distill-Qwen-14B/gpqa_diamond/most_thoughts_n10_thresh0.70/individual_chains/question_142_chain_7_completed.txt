Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but let me try to think through this.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this looks familiar. Oh right! That's the density matrix for a completely mixed state. Because when you have equal probabilities for each state, it's like a classical mixture. So, for a single qubit, the state |0⟩⟨0| is the projector onto the state |0⟩, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|. Adding them together with a coefficient of 1/2 gives a diagonal matrix with entries 1/2 on the diagonal.

But what's the geometrical position? Geometrical position in qubit space... I think qubits are represented as vectors in a two-dimensional complex vector space. But wait, the density matrices are more like points in the space of Hermitian matrices, right? Because density matrices are Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and trace one.

Wait, the geometrical position probably refers to the Bloch vector representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's a vector on the surface of the unit sphere. For a mixed state, it's inside the sphere. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's write that out. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So I is the identity matrix, [[1,0],[0,1]].

Given ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute that. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) times I. So ρ = (I)/2.

Now, using the Bloch representation: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If ρ = I/2, then:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2  
Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ  
Subtract I: 0 = r·σ  
So r·σ must be zero. Which means the vector r is (0,0,0). Because r is multiplied by each Pauli matrix, so for each component: r_x * σx + r_y * σy + r_z * σz = 0. The only solution is r = (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch vector representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is related to the density matrix \( \rho \) by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Substituting \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \) into the Bloch representation:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting \( I \), we find:

\[
0 = \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

This implies that \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), as the only solution for \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \) is the zero vector. Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).
