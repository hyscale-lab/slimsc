Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and determining its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think I should first figure out what state this represents. Wait, |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the standard basis states. So, |0⟩⟨0| is a projector onto the state |0⟩, and same for |1⟩⟨1|. Adding them together and scaling by 1/2 gives us an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So this must be a mixed state with equal probability in both states.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on or inside the unit sphere. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's on the surface, and the density matrix is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. For mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

The general form of the density matrix in Bloch vector terms is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector with components (x, y, z). So, r determines the position on the Bloch sphere.

Let's write out the given ρ. It's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute what this matrix looks like. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, dividing by 2, we get [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is the 2x2 identity matrix multiplied by 1/2.

Wait, the identity matrix is I. So ρ = I/2. Now, using the Bloch form: (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Let me subtract I/2 from both sides: (r·σ)/2 = 0. So r·σ must be zero matrix.

Wait, but σ is a vector of Pauli matrices. So for r·σ to be zero, each component of r must make the dot product zero. Hmm, let's think. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ = r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. For this to equal zero matrix, each component must be zero. Because σx, σy, σz are all traceless, and any non-zero combination would give a non-zero matrix. So the only possibility is r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. So r is the zero vector.

Wait, so the Bloch vector is (0,0,0). That would mean the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere. Because the density matrix is I/2, which is the completely mixed state. Makes sense because the state has no coherence and equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩, so it's the maximally mixed state.

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → Not zero, so probably not.

B) (0,0,1) → That's the state |1⟩, but our state is mixed, not pure. So no.

C) (0,0,0) → This matches what we found. The state is in the center.

D) (1,1,1) → No, that's outside the Bloch sphere.

So the correct answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state with equal probabilities for the qubit to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Substituting into the Bloch representation, we find:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right).
\]

Subtracting \(\frac{I}{2}\) from both sides gives:

\[
r \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

For this to hold, the Bloch vector \(r\) must satisfy \(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the maximally mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This is not zero and does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|1\rangle\), which is not the case here.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** This matches the Bloch vector for the given density matrix.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** This is outside the Bloch sphere and does not correspond to the given density matrix.

The correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
