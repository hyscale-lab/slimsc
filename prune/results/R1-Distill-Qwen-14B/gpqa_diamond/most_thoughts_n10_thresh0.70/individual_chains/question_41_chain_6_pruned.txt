Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, right. So a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium... Normally, when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the glass is moving, so maybe I need to consider some sort of relative motion.

So, I remember something about Galilean transformations because we're dealing with velocities in different frames. Oh wait, wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. But in this problem, maybe v is small enough that we can use a non-relativistic approach. Or perhaps it's intended to be treated with Galilean addition.

Let me think. The observer is in the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer and in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

In the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. Because the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the
