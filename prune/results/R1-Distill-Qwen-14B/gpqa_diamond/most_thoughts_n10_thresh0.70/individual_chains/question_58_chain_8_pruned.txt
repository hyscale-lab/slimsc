Okay, so I have this question about physical theories and which one doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, regularization is a concept I remember from my studies, but let me think it through. Regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Like when you get infinite results in calculations, you regularize them to make the math work and then remove the divergence, or renormalize.

So the question is asking which theory never needs this regularization. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), C) QED (Quantum Electrodynamics), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, so I should probably evaluate each option one by one.

Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version, right? So it's just Maxwell's equations and all that. Classical theories don't really have the same kind of divergences as quantum theories because they don't deal with probabilities and particles in the same way. Wait, but wait, in classical electrodynamics, you can have issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge, or the self-energy of a charge. Those are problems too, but do they require regularization? Or maybe in the classical theory, these infinities are handled differently, perhaps by assuming a distribution or using some other method. But I'm not sure whether classical ED requires regularization. Since regularization is more of a quantum field theory tool, maybe classical doesn't need it. But then again, I think that in classical theories, you can have infinities, but you don't need to use renormalization techniques because you're not quantizing. So maybe classical ED doesn't require regularization because it's not using the same methods as quantum theories.

Next, option C, Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is a quantum field theory and when it was first developed, it had issues with divergent integrals. People like Feynman and Dyson worked on this, and they found that QED was renormalizable. So you have to regularize the calculations, maybe using methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc. So QED does require regularization, which means it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option B is QCD. That's the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, and it has asymptotic freedom. But wait, does it require regularization? Well, in practice, QCD calculations often involve regularization because of loop divergences. But wait
