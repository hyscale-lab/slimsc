Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm. I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. So the question is asking which of these theories doesn't need that.

Let me look at the options:

A) Superstring Theory
B) Quantum Chromodynamics
C) Quantum Electrodynamics
D) Classical Electrodynamics

Wait, what's regularization again? Right, when you have loop integrals in perturbative calculations, you get divergences. Regularization introduces a temporary cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove it later, hopefully with a renormalization procedure. So regularization is needed when the theory has such divergences.

Now, thinking about each theory:

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the same kind of divergences as quantum theories. Or does it? Oh wait, wait! In classical electromagnetism, things like point charges have issues with self-energy and radiation reaction. But I think those are handled differently, perhaps through the concept of delayed potentials or other classical methods. But wait, regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So classical theories wouldn't require regularization because they don't use perturbative expansions with Feynman diagrams and loop integrals. So maybe classical ED doesn't need regularization.

But wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So the other options are quantum theories.

Option
