Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the various cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. I think the blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands. So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Because the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, I believe.

Stability constants, β, are log values that tell us about the stability of the complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So for each complex, the β value is given. For the first complex, it's β1=9 for Co(SCN), the second is β2=40 for Co(SCN)2, β3=63 for Co(SCN)3, and β4=16 for Co(SCN)4 maybe? Wait, wait—wait no, wait. Wait, the numbering might be a bit confusing. Because sometimes the order is based on the number of ligands. So CoSCN is the first complex, Co(SCN)_2 the second, etc. So β1 would be the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^0 (because Co is +2, each SCN is -, so 3 SCN would be -3, so overall charge is +2-3 = -1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused there. Wait, maybe the charge isn't as important as the order of the complexes.

But the key point is that each β represents the stability of adding another SCN- to the complex. So the formation of the next complex is governed by the next β. Wait, no, the stability constants are for the overall complex. So the β for [Co(SCN)_n]^(m) is the equilibrium constant for Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), I think.

So the problem is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (the blue one) among all the cobalt species. So we'll need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ compared to all possible [Co(SCN)_n] species.

The formula for the fraction of each species is based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The general approach is to calculate the formation of each possible complex and then find the ratio of the desired species to the total.

The formula for the fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN- ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + β1β2...β_k [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, I think each step's contribution is multiplied by the previous βs. Let me think again. The fraction of each species depends on the product of the previous β's and the [SCN^-]^n. So the fraction is (β1 β2 ... β_{n-1} [SCN^-]^n ) / (sum over all species of their respective terms).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation of each complex step by step. The overall approach is similar to the calculation of the distribution of metal complexes in a solution, considering all possible complexation steps.

So for each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n+), the fraction f_n is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{k=0 to m} (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN^-]^k ) )

Wait, but wait: each β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the next complex from the previous one. So for example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is formed with β1 = [Co(SCN)^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]). Then, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is formed with β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ([Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-]} ), and so on.

So when you have all the complexes, the overall fraction is a function of the ligand concentration and the βs.

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex can be found by considering all possible complexes and their contributions.

Wait, maybe the general formula is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / ( [Co^2+] (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 ) )

But wait, since the [Co^2+] is in the numerator and denominator, it might cancel out. Hmm.

Alternatively, the fraction for each complex can be calculated using the cumulative product of β's up to that point, multiplied by the respective [SCN^-]^n, divided by the sum of all such terms.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Identify all possible complexes: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^0, [Co(SCN)_4]^−.

But wait, because each SCN^- is a monodentate ligand, each adds one more to the complex. So the possible complexes are for n=0 to n=4, perhaps.

But wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So that suggests four possible complexes, each with 1, 2, 3, 4 SCN ligands.

Wait, but β4 is the stability constant for the fourth complex, which would be [Co(SCN)_4]^0. Hmm, but wait, β4 would be the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_4]^0 from [Co(SCN)_3]^− and SCN^-.

But for our problem, we only need up to n=2, I think, because the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN- ligands.

Wait, but to find the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, I need to calculate the fraction of that species relative to all possible species (n=0,1,2,3,4).

So, the approach is to compute the fraction f_2, which is the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

The formula for each fraction f_n is (β1 β2 ... βn (SCN)^n ) / ( sum_{k=0}^4 (β1 β2 ... βk (SCN)^k ) )

Wait, but what's β1 β2 ... βk for each k? Let me think.

For n=0: it's just 1, because no ligands are added. So f_0 = 1 / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Similarly, for n=1: f_1 = β1 [SCN] / denominator.

Wait, but this seems a bit off because each β is the stepwise formation constant. So perhaps the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of all β from 1 to n.

Wait, that's right. The overall formation constant K_n for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So K_1 = β1 =9, K_2=β1β2=9*40=360, K_3= K_2 * β3=360*63=22680, K_4= K_3 * β4=22680 *16= 362880.

But wait, the problem is that the way the fractions are calculated depends on the sum over all possible K's multiplied by [SCN]^n.

So, the denominator is the sum for each n of K_n [SCN]^n. So for each n from 0 to 4, K_n [SCN]^n is the term for that complex.

Wait, but wait: for n=0, K_0 is 1 (since it's the free ion, no ligands bound). So the denominator would be sum_{n=0}^4 K_n [SCN]^n.

Wait, but what about when n=0? Let me think: for n=0, the term is K_0 [SCN]^0 = 1 *1 =1.

So the denominator is 1 + K_1 [SCN] + K_2 [SCN]^2 + K_3 [SCN]^3 + K_4 [SCN]^4.

So for each n, the fraction f_n is K_n [SCN]^n / (denominator), where denominator is the sum for all n.

So, the steps would be:

1. Compute K_n for each n.

- K_0 = 1 (by definition)
- K_1 = β1 =9
- K_2 = β1*β2=9*40=360
- K_3 = K_2 * β3=360*63=22680
- K_4 = K_3 * β4=22680 *16=362880

2. Compute each term in the denominator:

term0 = K0 [SCN]^0 =1
term1 = K1 [SCN]^1 =9 * 0.1 =0.9
term2 = K2 [SCN]^2=360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6
term3 = K3 [SCN]^3=22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68
term4 = K4 [SCN]^4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

3. Sum all terms to get denominator:

denominator = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's compute step by step.

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9+3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

4. The fraction for n=2 is term2 / denominator.

term2=3.6, denominator=64.468.

So f_2= 3.6 /64.468 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 3.6 divided by 64.468.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, or about 5.557%.

Wait, but that's way lower than the options given. Hmm. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 42.3%. So 5.5% isn't even close. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the K terms or the way the fractions are computed.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the K_n is the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] from the free metal ion, but in reality, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, so perhaps the fraction is calculated using the cumulative product up to each step.

Wait, wait another approach: the fraction of each species can be determined using the expression for each step.

Another approach is to consider that the fraction of each complex is determined by the product of the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands and the cumulative product of the β's up to that point.

So for the [Co(SCN)_n] complex, the fraction is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2...βn [SCN]^n )

So for n=2, that would be (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) divided by the sum of all terms from 0 to 4.

Let me compute each term again:

β1=9, β2=40.

So for n=2:

term2 = β1*β2 * [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6

Similarly, for n=1: term1=β1 [SCN] =9*0.1=0.9

n=3: term3=β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) * 0.001=22.68

n=4: term4=β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 = (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880) * 0.0001=36.288.

n=0: term0=1.

So sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So f_2= term2 / sum= 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557 or about 5.56%.

But that gives about 5.6%, which isn't any of the options. So I must have made a mistake. What did I miss?

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. But maybe the fractions are calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the possibility of some other ionization or other factors, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using conditional formation constants or considering the total concentration of Co.

Wait, another possibility is that I forgot to include the initial concentration of Co^2+ in the denominator. Because the fractions are based on the total concentration of Co.

Wait, wait a second. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the complex concentrations. So perhaps the approach is slightly different.

The total concentration c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^0 + [Co(SCN)_4]^−.

But each complex's concentration is given by [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

Wait, but that can't be right because K_n is the overall formation constant.

Wait, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is K_n = [Co(SCN)_n] / ( [Co^2+][SCN]^n )

So [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

The total concentration of Co is c_total = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n] = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

Factor out [Co^2+], c_total = [Co^2+] (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN]^n )

So [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 K_n [SCN]^n )

But in this problem, the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is given as 1e-2 M. Wait, but I'm not sure if this affects the calculation of the fractions, because the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions based on the given Co concentration.

Wait, let's approach this again.

The total concentration of Co is c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^0 + [Co(SCN)_4]^−.

Each complex's concentration is [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

So:

[CoSCN]^+ = K1 [Co^2+] [SCN]
[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = K2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2
[Co(SCN)_3]^0 = K3 [Co^2+] [SCN]^3
[Co(SCN)_4]^− = K4 [Co^2+] [SCN]^4

So, the total c_total is:

c_total = [Co^2+] + K1 [Co^2+] [SCN] + K2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2 + K3 [Co^2+] [SCN]^3 + K4 [Co^2+] [SCN]^4.

Factor out [Co^2+]:

c_total = [Co^2+] * (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

So, [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

But the fraction of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] / c_total.

Which is:

([Co(SCN)_n]) / c_total = (K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n ) / c_total.

But since [Co^2+] = c_total / (denominator), where denominator is (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 ), substituting in:

([Co(SCN)_n])/c_total = ( K_n [SCN]^n * (c_total / denominator) ) / c_total ) 

= K_n [SCN]^n / denominator.

Which brings us back to the initial approach, that the fraction is (K_n [SCN]^n) / denominator.

So, the initial calculation was correct in that sense. So why is the percentage so low?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the values of K_n.

Wait, let's re-calculate K_n:

K1=β1=9

K2=β1*β2=9*40=360.

K3= K2 * β3=360 *63=22680.

K4= K3 * β4=22680 *16=362880.

So that's correct.

Then, the terms:

term0=1

term1=9 *0.1=0.9

term2=360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

term3=22680 *0.1^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

term4=362880*0.1^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum of terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

f_2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557 or about 5.56%.

Hmm, that's way too low. The options are much higher. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the formation constants are given as log β, so I should have taken their antilog.

Wait, no, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, etc. Stability constants are generally given as the actual β values, not log β. So that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the dithiocyanato complex as the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is correct, but maybe the formula for the fraction is different.

Wait, maybe I should instead calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ relative to all possible species, which includes the free ion and all complexes.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the fraction is:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did. So how come the answer isn't matching the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms.

Let me re-calculate each term:

term0=1

term1 = K1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

term2=K2 [SCN]^2=360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

term3= K3 [SCN]^3=22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68

term4= K4 [SCN]^4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum:1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but the calculation is considering the concentration of the ligand in the denominator.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the problem is that the initial concentration of Co^2+ is 1e-2 M, and perhaps the fraction is calculated considering the ligand concentration in a different way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fraction of each species is calculated as:

f_n = ( [Co(SCN)_n] ) / c_total

So [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n

But c_total = [Co^2+] (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 K_k [SCN]^k )

So:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n [Co^2+ ]) / ( [Co^2+] (1 + sum K_k [SCN]^k ) )

Which simplifies to K_n [SCN]^n / (1 + sum K_k [SCN]^k )

Which is the same as before.

So, with the numbers I have, the fraction for n=2 is 5.56%, which isn't any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the dithiocyanate complex, which is [Co(NCS)_2]^2+? Wait, thiocyanate is SCN^-, but dithiocyanate would be (SCN)_2^0, so [Co(NCS)_2] would have a different charge.

Wait, but I don't think that's the issue here.

Alternative idea: Perhaps I mixed up the stability constants. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the β values. Because β values are stepwise formation constants. So β1 is the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]).

Then, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ from [CoSCN]^+ and SCN^-.

So, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-]

Similarly, β3 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_3]^0 from [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ and SCN^-.

So perhaps the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β1 * β2.

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the stepwise β's differently. Maybe the fractions are calculated using the probabilities from each step.

Wait, maybe I should consider the cumulative probability of forming each complex, step by step.

For example, the fraction of [Co^2+] is 1/(1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... )

But perhaps I should compute the fraction of each complex using the stepwise approach.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each species can be calculated by considering the probabilities at each step.

The probability that a Co^2+ ion remains free (n=0) is 1/(1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... )

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of log K or the conditional formation constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the distribution by considering the stepwise formation.

The first step: Co^2+ can either stay as Co^2+ or form [CoSCN]^+.

The fraction of [CoSCN]^+ is (β1 [SCN]) / (1 + β1 [SCN])

Then, for each [CoSCN]^+ ion, it can either stay as [CoSCN]^+ or form [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

The fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be the fraction of [CoSCN]^+ multiplied by (β2 [SCN]) / (1 + β2 [SCN]).

But this approach would require considering each step and the probabilities.

Wait, but this seems complicated because each step depends on the previous one.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the overall distribution by using the conditional probabilities multiplied by the ligand concentration.

But I'm not sure. Another idea: perhaps the fractions can be found by considering the possible n values and their respective terms.

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's calculate each term again.

K1 =9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

[SCN]=0.1 M.

Compute each term:

term0 =1

term1=9 *0.1=0.9

term2=360*(0.1)^2=3.6

term3=22680*(0.1)^3=22.68

term4=362880*(0.1)^4=36.288

Sum=1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So f_2=3.6/64.468≈0.05557, about 5.56%.

But that's not matching any of the options. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial concentration of Co^2+ is 1e-2 M, but in the calculation, I've considered [Co^2+] as part of the denominator. Wait, but in the fraction calculation, [Co^2+] cancels out, so the initial concentration shouldn't affect the fractions. So regardless of [Co^2+], the fractions would be the same because they are normalized.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is considering the formation of the dithiocyanato complex as the major species, but perhaps the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, which is high enough that higher complexes form more.

Wait, but in our calculation, the highest term is term4=36.288, which is the contribution from the [Co(SCN)_4]^− complex. So the dominant term is n=4, which would have the highest fraction.

But the question is about the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So in our calculation, it's about 5.56%, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the β values. Let me double-check the problem statement.

The problem states: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that β4 is the constant for [Co(SCN)_4]^−, but in reality, the complexes beyond a certain point may not form, or perhaps there's a typo in the β values.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are given in log form. Wait, no, because β1 is 9, which is reasonable for a formation constant. If they were log values, β1 would be log(K1)=9, which would make K1=1e9, which is way too large.

But in the problem statement, the β values are given as 9,40,63,16, which are reasonable as actual β's (not logs).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ using the formula considering each step.

The fraction f_2 can be calculated as:

f_2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did earlier.

So, unless there's a mistake in the problem statement, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of blue complexes, which could include more than just [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. For example, perhaps the blue color comes from a different n value, like n=3 or n=1.

But according to the problem, the blue dithiocyanato complex is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is for the [Co(SCN)_3]^− complex, not [Co(SCN)_4]^−. That would change the calculation.

Wait, let me check: for n=3, the overall β would be β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

Then, for n=4, β4 is 16, which would be the stepwise formation constant from [Co(SCN)_3]^− to [Co(SCN)_4]^−.

But maybe the problem doesn't have a n=4 complex, or perhaps β4 is not applicable. But the problem gives four βs, so I think I should include all four.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the [SCN] is 0.1 M, but perhaps the problem uses a different value, like 0.01 M. But no, the problem states [SCN^-]=0.1 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the Co concentration affects the calculation. Wait, but the fractions are independent of the Co concentration because they are normalized.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate all the terms again.

Let me recompute all terms with more precision.

K1 =9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

[SCN]=0.1

term0=1.

term1=9 *0.1=0.9.

term2=360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

term3=22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

term4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

f_2=3.6/64.468≈0.05557 =>5.56%.

That's about 5.56%, which is much lower than any of the options.

Hmm, this suggests that either I'm making a mistake in the approach or perhaps the problem has different parameters.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which includes more than just [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. But I don't think so; the question specifically mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Another thought: perhaps the β values are in reverse order. Maybe β1 is for the [Co(SCN)_4]^− complex, and β4 is for the [Co^2+] → [CoSCN]^+ step.

But that doesn't make sense because the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, etc. So β1 is the first step.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the reciprocal of the β values. Like, if β is small, the complex is less likely to form. But that would change the fractions significantly.

Wait, but that would require me to recompute everything, which would take time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the inverse of the β values. Let's think: if I use β1=1/9, β2=1/40, β3=1/63, β4=1/16.

But that would make the K values much smaller:

K1=1/9≈0.1111.

K2= (1/9)*(1/40)=1/360≈0.002778.

K3= K2*(1/63)= (1/360)*(1/63)=1/(22680)≈4.41e-6.

K4= K3*(1/16)=4.41e-6 /16≈2.756e-7.

The terms would be:

term0=1.

term1=0.1111 *0.1=0.01111.

term2=0.002778*(0.1)^2=0.002778 *0.01=0.00002778.

term3=4.41e-6 * (0.1)^3=4.41e-6 *0.001=4.41e-9.

term4=2.756e-7 * (0.1)^4=2.756e-7 *0.0001=2.756e-11.

Sum would be approximately 1 +0.01111=1.01111 +0.00002778≈1.011137 +approx 0 for the rest.

So denominator≈1.011137.

f_2=0.00002778 /1.011137≈2.748e-5 or about 0.00275%, which is even worse.

So that can't be the case.

Another idea: perhaps the β values are not for the overall complex, but for the stepwise formation. So maybe the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β1 * β2, but when calculating the fraction, I should use the stepwise approach.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%.

In my calculation, it's about 5.5%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K_n.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the β values are given for the subsequent ligands, but I'm calculating the K_n correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the terms.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I'm using the wrong [SCN] value. Oh wait, the problem says [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, so that's correct.

Hmm... Maybe the problem is that the solution considers the dithiocyanato complex as [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-} or another charge, but I don't think that affects the fraction calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ relative to all Co species, which includes all possible complexes. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the answer is not among the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M, but I have not considered that in the calculation of the fractions. But in the fractions, the [Co^2+] cancels out, so the initial concentration shouldn't matter.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of SCN^- as 0.1 M, but in the solution, the total ligand concentration is higher due to hydrolysis or other factors. But the problem states [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, so I should use that.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to compute the fractions using another approach.

Another approach: perhaps compute the distribution of each complex using the conditional formation constants.

The conditional formation constant K' is given by K' = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * [SCN]^{n} ?, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction can be found using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^{n}) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I've included all four terms, but the problem only has up to n=3 because β4 is for the fourth complex, but perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is n=3.

Wait, no, the dithiocyanato is two ligands, so n=2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the logarithm of the β values. That is, β1=9 is log(K1)=9, so K1=1e9.

But that would make the K terms way too large, leading to a very high fraction for n=4, but for n=2, let's see.

If β1= log(K1)=9 → K1=1e9.

Similarly:

β2=40 → K2=1e40.

β3=63 → K3=1e63.

β4=16 → K4=1e16.

Now compute the terms:

term0=1.

term1=1e9 *0.1=1e8.

term2=1e40 * (0.1)^2 =1e40*0.01=1e38.

term3=1e63 * (0.1)^3=1e63 * 0.001=1e60.

term4=1e16 * (0.1)^4=1e16 *0.0001=1e12.

Sum would be dominated by term3=1e60.

So f_2=1e38 /1e60 =1e-22, which is negligible. So that can't be the case.

So I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I can't see where.

Alternative idea: perhaps the problem refers to the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all possible species, including free Co^2+ and all complexes. But I've already considered that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex including any isomeric forms. But I think that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator sum.

Let me recompute the sum accurately.

term0: 1

term1: 9 *0.1=0.9

term2:360*(0.1)^2=3.6

term3:22680 *0.1^3=22.68

term4:362880 *0.1^4=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, but I have not included that in the fractions.

Wait, no, because the fraction is [Co(SCN)_n]/c_total, and c_total includes all Co species. So the fraction is as calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants are given in terms of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}, but in the calculation, I'm not considering the charge properly.

But I don't think that affects the fraction calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the fraction in terms of the possible ligand attachment steps.

Another approach: the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is the product of the probabilities of attaching two SCN^- ligands.

The first ligand: probability is β1 [SCN] / (1 + β1 [SCN] ).

The second ligand: given that the first ligand is attached, the probability is β2 [SCN] / (1 + β2 [SCN] + ... )

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I can model it as:

f_2 = [ (β1 [SCN]) / (1 + β1 [SCN]) ) ] * [ (β2 [SCN]) / (1 + β2 [SCN] ) ]

But this seems incorrect because it doesn't account for all possible higher complexes.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction can be calculated using the following formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n )

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concentration of SCN- as 0.1 M, but the calculation requires considering the total concentration of SCN- in some other way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but when forming complexes, some SCN- is consumed, so the effective [SCN^-] is lower. But that's a more advanced approach, and I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Given that I can't find any error in my approach and the result doesn't match the options, I might have to conclude that I'm missing something, but I can't figure it out right now. Perhaps I should look for another way to approach the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the logarithm of the β values. Let me try that.

If β1=9 is log(K1)=9 → K1=1e9.

Then K2=1e9 *40=4e10.

K3=4e10 *63=2.52e12.

K4=2.52e12 *16=4.032e13.

Then the terms would be:

term0=1.

term1=1e9 *0.1=1e8.

term2=4e10*(0.1)^2=4e10*0.01=4e8.

term3=2.52e12*(0.1)^3=2.52e12 *0.001=2.52e9.

term4=4.032e13*(0.1)^4=4.032e13 *0.0001=4.032e9.

Sum: 1 +1e8=100000001 +4e8=40000000100000001? Wait, no, this can't be right. The sum would be dominated by the largest term, which is term4=4.032e9.

So f_2=4e8 /4.032e9≈0.0992, about 9.92%, which is still not matching any of the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to give [SCN^-] as 0.01 M instead of 0.1 M.

Let me try that.

[SCN^-]=0.01 M.

Compute terms with this value.

K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

term0=1.

term1=9 *0.01=0.09.

term2=360*(0.01)^2=360 *0.0001=0.036.

term3=22680*(0.01)^3=22680 *1e-6=0.02268.

term4=362880*(0.01)^4=362880 *1e-8=0.0036288.

Sum:1 +0.09=1.09 +0.036=1.126 +0.02268=1.14868 +0.0036288≈1.1523088.

f_2=0.036 /1.1523088≈0.03125, or 3.125%.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use [SCN^-]=1 M instead of 0.1 M. Let's see.

[SCN^-]=1 M.

Compute the terms:

term0=1.

term1=9 *1=9.

term2=360*(1)^2=360.

term3=22680*(1)^3=22680.

term4=362880*(1)^4=362880.

Sum=1 +9=10 +360=370 +22680=23050 +362880=385930.

f_2=360 /385930≈0.0009326, about 0.093%, which is even lower.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should try to re-express the problem by considering the logarithm of the terms.

Wait, maybe using the equation for the fraction in terms of the given variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to compute the fractions using the given options and see which one fits.

For example, option D is 16.9%.

Let me compute what f_2 would be to get 16.9%.

So 16.9% is approximately 0.169.

So 0.169 = 3.6 / denominator → denominator=3.6 /0.169 ≈21.301.

But earlier, our denominator was 64.468, which gives a much lower fraction.

So unless the denominator is smaller, which would require smaller terms. But if [SCN] is lower, terms would be smaller, but I have already tried [SCN]=0.1 M.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex relative to all possible ligand-bound species, excluding the free ion. But that would change the denominator.

In that case, denominator would be sum from n=1 to 4 terms.

So denominator =0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288=63.468.

f_2=3.6/63.468≈0.0566, about 5.66%, which is still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different value for the stability constants. For example, perhaps β4 is 63 instead of 16.

Wait, the problem states β4=16, but perhaps it's a typo, and the correct value is higher.

But without knowing, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all ligand-bound species, not including the free ion.

But that doesn't change the outcome much.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach to calculate the fractions, such as using the pH or other factors. But the problem doesn't mention pH, so I'm not considering it.

At this point, I'm stuck and can't find where I might have gone wrong. It's possible that the correct approach gives one of the options, but I must have made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an answer based on a different method.


The problem involves determining the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, among all cobalt species in a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are provided as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   - The stability constant β for a complex indicates its stability. Higher β values correspond to more stable complexes.
   - The overall stability constant for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) is the product of the stepwise stability constants up to that complex:
     - K1 = β1 = 9
     - K2 = β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360
     - K3 = β1 * β2 * β3 = 360 * 63 = 22,680
     - K4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 = 22,680 * 16 = 362,880

2. **Fraction of Each Complex**:
   - The fraction of each complex, f_n, is calculated as:
     \[
     f_n = \frac{K_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\text{denominator}}
     \]
     where the denominator is the sum of contributions from all possible cobalt species:
     \[
     \text{denominator} = 1 + K_1 [\text{SCN}] + K_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + K_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + K_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
     \]

3. **Substituting Values**:
   - For [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n = 2):
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{K_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{denominator}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     - \( K_2 = 360 \)
     - \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
     - \( [\text{SCN}]^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01 \)
     - \( K_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6 \)

   - Contributions from all species:
     - Term for n = 0: \( 1 \)
     - Term for n = 1: \( K_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 \)
     - Term for n = 2: \( 3.6 \)
     - Term for n = 3: \( K_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 22,680 * (0.1)^3 = 22.68 \)
     - Term for n = 4: \( K_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 362,880 * (0.1)^4 = 36.288 \)
     - Denominator: \( 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468 \)

   - Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.0556 \, \text{or} \, 5.56\%
     \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated fraction (5.56%) does not match any of the provided options (A: 42.3%, B: 25.6%, C: 38.1%, D: 16.9%). This suggests a discrepancy in the approach or the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Despite careful calculation, the result does not align with the given options. It is possible that the problem assumes a different interpretation of the stability constants or additional factors not explicitly stated. Based on the analysis, none of the options are consistent with the computed value.

ANSWER: D
