Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm. Let me think about it. Alright, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. So the basic idea is that the probability of a nucleus decaying doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh right, it's memoryless. Wait, how does that work?

The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, if I have the atom, there's a 32% chance it'll decay in the first 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have already passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. So what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, wait. So the first 100 minutes is the initial time frame. But 50 minutes have passed, so there's 50 left in that 100-minute window. But the question is about the next 150 minutes after those 50. Hmm, maybe I should clarify the time frames.

So, the initial setup is that the atom's decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's our initial half-life or something? Wait, not exactly. Because the half-life is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay. But 32% isn't half, so maybe it's a different time frame.

Alternatively, the decay constant λ can be calculated from the given probability. The formula for the probability of decay in a time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). So,
