Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly but are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. 

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm. So the initial situation is that at a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third reach the walls. We need to find the new Lorentz factor where two-thirds reach.

Wait, I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is related to time dilation and length contraction. Since these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is longer than their proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame). 

So the particles' decay depends on their lifetime as seen by the detector. If a particle's lifetime is longer, they can travel a longer distance before decaying, which would mean more of them reach the detector's inner walls.

The key here is probably the relation between the proper lifetime (tau) and the dilated lifetime (gamma * tau). The distance a particle travels before decaying is its velocity multiplied by the time it lives, so in the lab frame, that's v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but these particles are produced at the center of the detector. So the maximum distance they can travel before reaching the inner wall is the radius, which is 30 meters. 

So, the probability of a particle reaching the wall depends on whether it decays before traveling 30 meters. If a particle's lifetime is longer, it's more likely to reach the wall.

So the fraction of particles that reach the wall is probably related to the ratio of the distance they can travel (v * gamma * tau) compared to the radius of the detector.

Wait, but I think the key formula here is the proper decay length. The proper lifetime is tau, and the decay length in the lab frame is L = gamma * v
