Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So, I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical approximation.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, and the sum of the fragments' rest masses is 0.99 * M. But wait, M is the initial mass. So M_initial = M. The sum is 0.99 M, so the rest mass energy after is less than before. That suggests that some mass has been converted into kinetic energy or other forms, like binding energy or radiation, but the problem says nothing else is produced—so maybe the rest mass energy is less, and the rest is kinetic energy.

Wait, but in reality, mass can't just disappear. Oh, wait, in nuclear reactions, the rest mass of the products can be less than the initial because some mass is converted into kinetic energy. Because the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

The more massive fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say the less massive one has mass m, so the other has mass 2m. The total rest mass after is m + 2m = 3m. But the problem says that sum is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M. Therefore, m = (0.99/3) M, which is 0.33 M? Wait, wait, no, if M is the initial mass, then 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3 ≈ 0.33 M.

Wait, but wait, the initial rest mass is 300 Ge
