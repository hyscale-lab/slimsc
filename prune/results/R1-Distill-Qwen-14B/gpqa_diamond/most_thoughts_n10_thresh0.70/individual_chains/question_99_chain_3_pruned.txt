Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the FTIR part. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. And there's a strong peak at 1700 cm-1, which is a carbonyl group. So that's probably a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, the broad peak at 3000 might suggest it's a carboxylic acid because their O-H is usually broader. If it were an ester or ketone, the peak at 1700 would be around that area but not as broad. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data: no vinyl hydrogens. So there's no double bonds in the structure. That's good to know. So all the carbons are probably single-bonded.

The 1H NMR has several signals. One of them is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, that's a complex splitting. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Maybe this comes from some neighboring groups with multiple protons. Let me think about possible structures.

The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, all these are carboxylic acids since they end with COOH. So the IR makes sense.

Now looking at the structures. Each has a central structure, maybe a geminal di-substitution. Let's see:

Option D: It's (CH3CH2) groups attached to a CH that is connected to another CH with CH3 groups, and ends with COOH. So structure would be like CH2CH2CH2... Wait, maybe I should draw them.

Wait, let me try to visualize each option.

Option A:
The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.
So the central part is two CH groups each attached to ethyl groups and a CH2COOH. So the structure is symmetrical perhaps? So each CH is attached to two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH. Wait, maybe not. Maybe it's a geminal diethyl and a CH2COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the central part is a CH connected to ethyl, another CH connected to ethyl, and the COOH. So maybe each CH is
