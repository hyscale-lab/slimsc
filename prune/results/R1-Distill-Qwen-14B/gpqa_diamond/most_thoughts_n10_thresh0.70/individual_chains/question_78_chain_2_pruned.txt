Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time due to a moving charge. The setup is that there's a point charge q moving along some trajectory s(t), and we're considering the electromagnetic fields at a later time t, where t is greater than the time tr when the field was generated.

Wait, right. So the charge is moving, and we're looking at the potentials at a later time. I remember that the scalar and vector potentials are based on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. So the fields at time t depend on the charge's state at time tr, which is earlier.

The problem gives me options for V and A. Let's recall what the potentials are.

The scalar potential V is usually (for a static charge) given by Coulomb's law: V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But since the charge is moving, I think there's a correction factor involving the velocity. Oh wait, yes, when the charge is moving, the potentials aren't just static anymore. They depend on the motion of the charge, which affects how the potentials are calculated.

The vector potential A is more complicated. I remember that in the case of a moving charge, the vector potential can be expressed in terms of the velocity and the scalar potential. There's this equation where A is proportional to (v/c²) times V, maybe? Or something like that.

Wait, I think the general expression for the potentials when the charge is moving is derived from the retarded potentials. Retarded potentials because the effect of the charge's motion isn't instantaneous—it takes time for the changes to propagate at the speed of light.

So the potentials at a point r and time t are determined by the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is (t - r/c), where r is the distance from the charge to the observation point. Or wait, no, the exact expression for tr is that the light travel time from the charge's position at tr to the observation point is (t - tr), so tr = t - (r - d)/c, where d is the displacement? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, considering that
