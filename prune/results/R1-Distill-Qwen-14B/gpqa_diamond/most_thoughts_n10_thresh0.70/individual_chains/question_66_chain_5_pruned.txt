Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, wait. What do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. Oh right, the Standard Model has certain symmetries, so SMEFT must incorporate operators that respect those.

But wait, which symmetries are these? The Standard Model is based on the gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), and it respects Lorentz symmetry. So the operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. That makes sense because all terms in the Lagrangian must respect the symmetries of the theory to maintain consistency.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh, but wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's defined in a Lorentz-invariant way but typically it's formulated in a way that doesn't require the full Poincare symmetry because effective theories are built around a specific energy scale. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Because the Standard Model itself is Poincare symmetric, so any effective theory derived from it should also respect that. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps
