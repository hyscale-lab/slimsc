Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. These reactions involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. I think the most common ones are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. The question has three parts, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the reactions given. Then, I have to match them with the options provided.

Let's take it step by step.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to give product A.

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... the structure is like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Wait, but wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So, the structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CHOH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? Wait, no. Let me draw it. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2-OH on carbon 2, with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but has four carbons. So, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Let me think. The correct structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2... no, wait, butenol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or is it CH2CH2(OH)CH=CH2? No, that's but-2-en-2-ol. Wait, maybe I should write it properly.

But-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the OH is on C2.

So, it's CH2-CH2-
