Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question is about which planet, Planet_1 or Planet_2, is more likely to transit. They have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host star properties.

So, let me go through the given info again. Both planets are Earth-like, detected via the RV method. So their minimum masses are known. 

Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. But since the mass of the host star is different, I might need to calculate the actual semi-major axes.

The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have same radii. Wait, that's interesting. So same radius but different masses. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same size as Planet_2's star.

Transit probability is given by R_planet / R_star, but wait, no, that's the fractional dip. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is proportional to R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the probability is (R_star / a), assuming edge-on alignment. Because the planet's orbital plane needs to be aligned with our line of sight. The probability of that is roughly (R_star / a), because the star's disk has an angular size, and the planet's orbit must cross our line of sight.

So the probability P is (R_*) / a, where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

So to find which planet has a higher probability, we need to compute (R_*) / a for each.

Given that both stars have the same radius (R_1 = R_2), the probability depends on 1/a. So a smaller a (closer orbit) would mean higher probability. Because 1/a is larger when a is smaller.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximated as R_*/a. So yeah, if a is smaller, the probability is higher.

Now, let's calculate a for each planet.

Using Kepler's third law: (P^2) * (M_star + M_planet) = (4π²/G) * a^3. But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So, a^3 = [G * M_star * P^2] / (4π²)

So a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait, I should remember that Kepler's law in this form is a^3 = (G(M_star) P^2) / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).

So for each planet, let's compute a1 and a2.

Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2 (host star mass is twice that of Planet_2's host)

P1 = P2 / 3, since Planet_1's period is three times shorter.

So a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ (M2) * (P2)^2 ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 * (P2²/9)) / (M2 * P2²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify numerator inside: 2 M2 (P2²/9) = (2/9) M2 P2²

Denominator inside: M2 P2²

So the ratio is (2/9) / 1 = 2/9. So (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

Let me calculate (2/9)^(1/3). Well, 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of that is approximately 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216. So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's compute it exactly.

Cube of 0.6 is 0.216. 2/9 ≈ 0.222. So cube root is about 0.607 perhaps? Let me compute 0.6^3=0.216; 0.61^3=0.61*0.61=0.3721 *0.61≈0.227. Oh, so 0.61^3 ≈ 0.227, which is slightly above 0.222. So 0.61 cube is about 0.227. So cube root of 0.222 is about ~0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So (R_*/a1) = R*/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.648 (R*/a2)

Because (R*/a) for Planet_1 is R*/a1 = R*/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) (R*/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R*/a2)

But R*/a2 is the probability for Planet_2, so Planet_1's probability is about 1.648 times higher.

Wait, but wait. The probability is R*/a. So for Planet_1, (R*/a1) = (R*/ (0.606 a2)) ) = (1/0.606) * (R*/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R*/a2). Since R*/a2 is the probability for Planet_2, that means Planet_1 has a probability about 1.648 times higher.

Wait, wait, that's the opposite. Because transit probability is higher when a is smaller. Since a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1's transit probability is higher.

Wait, the initial analysis was correct. So the ratio is (R*/a1)/(R*/a2) = a2/a1.

Because (R*/a1)/(R*/a2) = (a2)/(a1) = 1/(0.606) ≈1.648.

So Planet_1's probability is about 1.648 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, that can't be right, because Planet_1's period is shorter, so it's closer in, which would mean higher probability. So higher probability for Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the a calculation.

a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1^2 )^(1/3 )

M1 is 2 M2, P1 is P2/3. So M1 * P1^2 = 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 = 2 M2 * P2² /9 = (2/9) M2 P2².

a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2^2)^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2/9) M2 P2² / ( M2 P2² ) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3 ) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is 0.606 a2. So a1 is smaller than a2. So R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2. So Planet_1's probability is higher.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

Wait, because R*/a1 = R*/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R*/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R*/a2). So (R*/a1) is about 1.65 times (R*/a2). So Planet_1's probability is higher. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait, but let me think again: Did I get the a1/a2 ratio correctly?

Wait, a1 is for Planet_1, a2 for Planet_2.

a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

M1 is 2 M2, P1 is (1/3) P2, so P1^2 = (1/9) P2^2.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2) * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

Which is a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

So (R*/a1) = R*/( a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ) = (R*/a2) * (9/2)^(1/3 )

Because 1/(2/9)^(1/3) is (9/2)^(1/3 )

What is (9/2)^(1/3 )? 9/2=4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is about 1.6506.

So (R*/a1) ≈ (1.65) (R*/a2 )

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred, with ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but earlier I thought that a1 is smaller, so higher probability. So, yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) (closer orbit) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axes for both planets:

1. **Planet_1**:  
   - Host star mass \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \) (twice the mass of Planet_2's host star).  
   - Orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet_2's orbital period).  
   - \( a_1^3 \propto (2M_{*,2}) \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} M_{*,2} P_2^2 \).

2. **Planet_2**:  
   - Host star mass \( M_{*,2} \).  
   - Orbital period \( P_2 \).  
   - \( a_2^3 \propto M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2 \).

Taking the ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \):  
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\frac{2}{9} M_{*,2} P_2^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]  
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]  
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:  
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]  
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

From the options, the correct choice is **C**, as it states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
