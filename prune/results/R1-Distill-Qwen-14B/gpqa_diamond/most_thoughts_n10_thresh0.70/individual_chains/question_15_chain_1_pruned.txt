Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm supposed to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the scenario is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one more likely to transit, because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, both have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 orbits its star much faster.

Also, both have circular orbits. That's important because eccentricity affects the transit probability, but since they're both circular, maybe that's not a factor here.

The host stars: The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius? Wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radii. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star. The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a_planet)^2, but since the planet radius is much smaller than the star, maybe it's approximated as R_star^2 / a_planet^2. Wait, but wait, the actual formula I recall is more about the impact parameter and the size of the orbit. The transit probability for a circular orbit is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (something else?), maybe multiplied by some factor. Let me think.

Wait, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view) is given by:

P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (m_planet/(M_star))^(1/3))) )

Wait, no, that's more about whether the planet is detectable via RV. Oh wait, no, I think the transit probability is actually simply the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis (if the orbit is edge-on), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric probability: the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned within the cone of our line of sight.

The formula I remember is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since
