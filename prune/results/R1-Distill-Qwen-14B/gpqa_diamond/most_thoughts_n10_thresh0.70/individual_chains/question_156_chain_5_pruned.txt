Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question involves a chemist performing two reactions with different starting materials—(E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene—and then analyzing the combined products using HPLC. I need to determine what the chromatograms would show on standard and chiral columns.

First, I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, when a diene reacts with mCPBA, it typically forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh right, that's the ring-opening of the epoxide. So the initial epoxide formation is followed by acid hydrolysis.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene with one equivalent of mCPBA. The diene is trans. When mCPBA adds to a double bond, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide. For (E) configuration, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. So when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen atoms would be on opposite sides? Or same? Wait, I think for mCPBA addition, it's a concerted process. So for a trans double bond, the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms on the same face or opposite?

Hmm, maybe I should draw it out. The (E)-oct-4-ene has the two substituents (CH2CH3 groups on each end) on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms from the peracid would add across the double bond in a syn addition. So for a trans double bond, adding two oxygen atoms in a syn fashion would lead to an epoxide where the two oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. Wait, no. Wait, when you have a trans double bond, the substituents are opposite. Syn addition would place the two oxygen atoms on the same face as each other, but since the substituents are trans, that might lead to a cis epoxide or trans epoxide? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the result. When you have a trans double bond and do epoxidation, the epoxide formed is a trans epoxide. For example, if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry of the starting alkene leads to the cis or trans epoxide. Let me think of cis and trans alkenes.

Another approach: suppose the double bond is E (trans). When mCPBA adds, it's a peracid, which adds across the double bond in a concerted way, leading to an epoxide. The addition is stereospecific. So, for a trans double bond, the epoxide would form with the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides, making it a trans epoxide. But wait, epoxides are cyclic ethers, so the configuration is about the ring. For the epoxide to be formed from a trans double bond, the oxygen atoms would be on the same face because the peracid adds in a way that the oxygen atoms are added on the same side. Wait, no. Wait, when a peracid adds to a double bond, it's an electrocyclic-like addition where the peracid's oxygen attacks the same face. So maybe the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that mCPBA adds to the less substituted face of the double bond, but that's another point. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of a specific example. Take (E)-2-pentene. When treated with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide would depend on the geometry of the starting alkene. For (E), the substituents are opposite, so adding the oxygen atoms on the same face would create a trans epoxide. Or maybe the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the outcome of the epoxide and the subsequent acid treatment. Once the epoxide is formed, treating it with aqueous acid leads to ring-opening. For an epoxide, the acid catalyzes the opening via a protonation step. The ring opens with the attack of a nucleophile (like water) on the more substituted carbon in a way that the more substituted carbocation is formed (since it's more stable).

Wait, but in this problem,
