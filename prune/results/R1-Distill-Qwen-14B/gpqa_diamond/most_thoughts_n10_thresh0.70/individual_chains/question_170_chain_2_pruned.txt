Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin of an electron along the y-direction. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve calculating the average value you'd expect to measure. The state given is (3i, 4), which I think is a column vector. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors for spin-½ particles like electrons.

The Pauli matrices come into play here, right? The σy matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the spin operator Sy is (ħ/2) multiplied by σy. Oh wait, because the Pauli matrices are for the spin-½ system, and the actual spin operator is (ħ/2)σ.

The expectation value of Sy is the bra-ket product of the state with Sy. So I need to compute <ψ| Sy |ψ>.

Let me write down the steps:

1. The state vector ψ is (3i, 4). So in component form, ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

2. Sy is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So Sy = (ħ/2)σy.

Wait, no, maybe I should compute it properly. Let's represent everything correctly.

The expectation value is <S_y> = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

So let's compute S_y first:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So, to compute this, I'll first write out the matrix:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [
[0, -i],
[i, 0]
]

Now, the expectation value is:

⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = [ (3i)*, 4* ] * (ħ/2) * [
[0, -i],
[i, 0]
] * [3i; 4]

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the order is important. So first, I'll compute S_y acting on |ψ>, then take the
