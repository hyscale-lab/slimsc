Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and a precipitate. So when you add a strong acid to it, the acid should react with the base to form a salt and water. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions, right?

So the problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how much 0.1 M HCl is needed to dissolve this, and then find the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I'll find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 has 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Next, moles of Fe(OH)3: mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check the calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 mol.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, specifically a hydroxide. When it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, the reaction should be:
Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. So for 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)3, moles of HCl needed are 0.000936 * 3 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The HCl solution is 0.1 M, which means moles per liter. To find the volume needed, V = moles / concentration. So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³. Close enough, probably due to rounding differences.

But wait, the question mentions 100 cm³ as the total volume. Does that affect the calculation? Oh, right, when you add the HCl to the solution, the total volume might change, but the question is asking for the volume of acid needed, not the final volume after mixing. So I think the 100 cm³ is just the final volume, but the amount of acid needed is separate.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says "the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution." Oh, so the total solution volume after adding acid is 100 cm³. So that might require a bit more HCl because the final concentration could be influenced by the total volume. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, no. The total volume is 100 cm³, but the acid volume is separate. Let me clarify. The problem says the solution after dissolving has a total volume of 100 cm³. So the acid volume plus the initial volume (probably the Fe(OH)3 in some solvent) equals 100 cm³. But maybe the initial solution is not specified, so perhaps the only component we're adding is the acid, but the total volume is fixed. Hmm, this is
