Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. So, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, since this is relativistic, I can't use simple classical formulas anymore. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

The setup is a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c.

In the classical case, the maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m). So that's option C. But since this is a relativistic problem, option C can't be the right answer because it's the non-relativistic solution.

In relativity, the energy considerations change. The total energy in special relativity isn't just kinetic plus potential, but also includes rest mass energy. Oh wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy usually is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, maybe the potential energy is treated differently? Or perhaps the expression for kinetic energy is modified.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx² in the classical case. But when considering relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy can't be (γ-1)mc², right? Or wait, maybe for small speeds, the classical approximation holds, but here we have to consider when the speed is a significant fraction of c.

So, perhaps the approach is to set the total energy as the sum of rest energy and the maximum potential energy. Wait, no, because the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. But in relativistic terms, the energy equation has to account for relativistic effects on the kinetic part.

Wait, maybe I should think about energy conservation. At maximum displacement, the potential energy is at maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. So, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which should be equal to the rest energy plus the kinetic energy at other points. Wait, no, because in special relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But wait, I might be mixing things up. Or perhaps the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the total mechanical energy in the classical sense? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should model the situation more carefully. The total energy of the oscillator in the relativistic case would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential). But wait,
