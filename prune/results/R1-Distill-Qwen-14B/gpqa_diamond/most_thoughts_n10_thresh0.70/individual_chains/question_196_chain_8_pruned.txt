Okay, I'm sitting here looking at this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my mechanics classes that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. But wait, this one's relativistic, which means I can't just use the classical equations—I have to consider how special relativity affects the motion.

The question gives me a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. They're asking for the maximum speed, v_max.

In the classical case (non-relativistic), the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)k A² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is about the relativistic case, so I don't think option C is the correct answer here. Relativity probably plays a role in the energy equations.

In relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x². But in relativity, when the mass is moving, its kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²—it's (gamma - 1)mc². Oh right, because the total energy is gamma mc², so the kinetic energy is the total minus rest energy, which is (gamma -1) mc².

So, when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude (x = A), all its energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, and kinetic is maximum.

Wait, but wait a minute. Actually, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes and zero at the center. So, when x is maximum (A), the potential is maximum, and kinetic is zero. At x=0, the potential is zero, and kinetic is maximum. So, the setup is that the system's total energy is a sum of kinetic and potential.

So, in the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)k A², because at x=A, that's the maximum potential.

Wait, but in relativity, the potential energy is treated as part of the total energy. So, the total energy
