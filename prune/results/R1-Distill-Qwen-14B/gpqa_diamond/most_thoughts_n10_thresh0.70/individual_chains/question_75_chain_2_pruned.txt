Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a problem with a transgenic mouse model where the researcher is trying to overexpress GADD45G but isn't succeeding. They've done some genetic engineering, introduced a HA tag, and when they check the construct, the plus strand sequence is given. So, the problem must be somewhere in that sequence.

The options given are A to D. Let me think about each one.

First, the researcher introduced an HA tag at the N-terminus. HA tags are usually used for detection and purification. So, maybe the HA sequence is causing an issue.

Looking at the sequence provided, I should check if the reading frame is correct. The HA tag is a small peptide, right? So, it's added to the beginning of the GADD45G coding sequence. The construct is probably in a vector that allows for inducible expression.

Now, the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Let's think about possible reasons. One possibility is a frameshift mutation, which would mess up the reading frame, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, maybe there's a stop codon introduced.

Wait, I remember that the HA tag is often added in frame. So, if the HA sequence has a premature stop codon, that could cause the ribosome to terminate early. Let me check the HA tag's codon usage.

The HA tag is from the influenza virus and is typically 11 amino acids long. So, the coding sequence would be about 33 nucleotides. Let me look at the beginning of the sequence provided.

The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Hmm, wait. ATG is the start codon, methionine. Then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again, GAT is aspartic acid, G is glycine. Wait, that doesn't sound right for HA. Because HA is a specific sequence, perhaps the construct didn't incorporate it correctly.

Wait, maybe the HA tag wasn't added properly. Alternatively, perhaps a mutation occurred during cloning, such as a point mutation leading to a stop codon. Or perhaps the addition of the HA tag introduced a stop codon earlier in the sequence.

Looking at the sequence again: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, the HA tag sequence would be right after ATG. If the HA coding sequence has a stop codon, that would cause translation to terminate early.

Alternatively, perhaps in the HA tag's coding sequence, a stop codon (like TAA, TAG, or TGA) is present. Let me check the first few codons.

The first few codons are ATG (Met), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), G (Gly). Hmm, wait, that's six codons, so 18 nucleotides. The HA tag is longer than that. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding.
