Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². And it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So, the field is directed outward or inward along the radius. The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, right, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. Oh, that might come in handy here.

The divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the field through the surface enclosing that volume. So, ∫(∇·f) dV = ∫f · n dA, where n is the outward normal vector to the surface.

But wait, in this problem, we're asked to compute the volume integral of the divergence, not the surface integral. But perhaps using the divergence theorem can simplify things because the surface integral might be easier to compute.

So, let's think about the field f(r). It has only a radial component and falls off as 1/r². Let me write that in mathematical terms. In spherical coordinates, the vector field can be expressed as f(r) = (F_r) r̂, where F_r is the magnitude (1/r²) and r̂ is the unit radial vector.

But wait, sometimes when you have a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r, you can express it as f(r) = F(r) r̂. In that case, the divergence is given by a specific formula in spherical coordinates. I think the divergence in spherical coordinates for such a field is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)) ) multiplied by r² sinθ dθ dφ or something... Wait, no, the divergence formula for a radial vector field F(r) r̂ is ∇·f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)).

Yes, that's right. So, for f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, F(r) is 1/r². So pl
