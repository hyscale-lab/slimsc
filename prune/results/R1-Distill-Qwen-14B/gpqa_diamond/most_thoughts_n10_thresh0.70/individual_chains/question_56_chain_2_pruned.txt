Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

The question is about the decay of the state |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options give different paths and probabilities. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in hydrogen, electrons transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions are the most common, so I should recall the selection rules for dipole transitions.

The selection rules for dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom are usually:
- Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but often the main transitions are Δn = ±1 for single-photon emission.
Wait, no, wait. Wait, when considering multi-photon transitions—like two-photon transitions—because this is a decay via two dipole transitions, maybe Δn can be more. But wait, the question says it's two dipole transitions, so each transition is a dipole. So each transition would have the usual selection rules.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and it decays via two transitions to |1,0,0⟩. So that's a two-step process. Each transition is a dipole transition, so each must obey the selection rules for dipole transitions.

For a dipole transition, the selection rules are:
- Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum by one)
- Δm = 0, ±
