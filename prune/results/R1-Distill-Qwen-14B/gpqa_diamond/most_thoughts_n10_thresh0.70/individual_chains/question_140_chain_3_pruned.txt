Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions and elements. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W, forming precipitate G, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce something with two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and the isotopes involved affect the atomic masses.

Hmm. Let me start by figuring out what each part refers to.

First, the reaction of X with Y. Violently reacting, probably a strong reaction. The gas W has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, that means the molecule is something like H2O or CO2? Wait, no. Let's think: a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, deuterium would have 1 proton and 1 neutron, but that's just a single atom. Wait, wait. The gas W's molecule must have the same number of neutrons and protons in each atom? Or the total? The wording says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total neutrons equal the total protons.

Wait, no. The wording is: "a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So for each molecule, the sum of all neutrons equals the sum of all protons across all atoms in the molecule. Let's think. Common gases: H2, O2, N2, CO2, H2O, etc.

Wait, H2 would have 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming protium). So total protons: 2, neutrons: 0. Not equal. O2: Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that's equal. So O2 is a possibility. Or maybe CO2? Wait, CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons?), O (8 each). Wait, C has 6 protons, and in its most common isotope, 6 neutrons (carbon-12). So CO2 would have 6+8*2=22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2= 22. So that's equal. So CO2 is another possibility.

Wait, but also, maybe another gas. Let's think about H2O. Each H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So for H2O: 2*(1) + 8=10 protons; 2*0 +8=8 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another thought: NH3? No, wait, that's not a gas in all conditions. Maybe CH4? No, same thing. Wait, maybe O3? Ozone. Each O has 8 protons. So three O atoms: 24 protons and 24 neutrons. So that's a possibility. Alternatively, H2O2? Each O is 8, H is 1. For H2O2, 2 H (2 protons) and 2 O (16 protons, 16 neutrons each?), but that would sum to 2+16=18 protons, 2*8=16*2=32? Wait, wait, that's getting confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like D2O, but that's a liquid, not a gas. Or maybe a diatomic molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. So O2 would fit because each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons in the molecule. So that's a possibility.

So gas W could be O2. Then, what about the reaction? When X reacts with Y, it releases O2. Hmm.

Now, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me think
