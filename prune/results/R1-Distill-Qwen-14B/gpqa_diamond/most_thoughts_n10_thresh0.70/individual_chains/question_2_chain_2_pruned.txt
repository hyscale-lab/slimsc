Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring connected to a propenal group. Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is the (E) isomer, right? So the structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. So the aldehyde is at one end of the double bond, and the benzene is at the other.

The first step is treating this with methylmagnesium bromide, which forms product 1. I think this is a Grignard reagent addition. Grignard reagents add to carbonyl groups. So trans-cinnamaldehyde has a carbonyl group, so the Grignard would add to that. Let me draw it out.

Cinnamaldehyde is:
Ph-CH₂-CHO (wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, wait. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait no. The correct structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but wait, that's not right. No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? Hmm, no. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Oh, right! So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No. Wait, the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe it's Ph-CH₂-CHO. No, that's benzaldehyde. Oh wait, no. Let me get this right.

Cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is benzene connected to a CH₂ group, but wait, no. Wait, propenal is CH₂=CH-CHO. But cinnamaldehyde is benzal with a double bond. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No. Wait, the correct
