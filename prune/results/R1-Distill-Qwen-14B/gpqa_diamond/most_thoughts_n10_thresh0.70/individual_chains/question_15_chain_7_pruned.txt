Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, given some parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the question says that both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, and both have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So if I remember right, the orbital period relates to the distance from the star, via Kepler's third law. A shorter period means the planet is closer in.

The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would that be? Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. I think evolved stars might expand, but in this case, maybe they're both similar in size, despite the mass difference. So the star for Planet_2 is possibly a bit larger, but in this case, their radii are the same.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula I recall is that the probability is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (a / (a * sin i))... Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the geometry. The chance that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight is higher for closer planets, because the orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on. But wait, no, I think the probability is actually (R_planet / R_star) squared multiplied by the probability that the inclination is right. Or maybe it's just proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 times (1 / (a)), or something like that.

Wait, more accurately, the probability of a transit is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s + R_p) / a ), but that might not be right. Wait, another approach: the transit probability depends on how likely the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a * sin i)), but I might be mixing up terms.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms
