Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable when using it with an 8m VLT telescope. The question gives six star options, a to f, and I have to figure out how many meet the S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure.

First, I need to understand what ESPRESSO is capable of. From the link I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method. Its high efficiency and resolving power are key. But what's its detection limit?

The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is a critical factor. The higher the S/N, the easier it is to detect a star. The question states that a S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel is needed. So I need to figure out for each star whether they can reach this S/N in an hour.

Each star has different characteristics. Let's look at each option:

a) Canopus: It's a bright star. I think Canopus is a prominent star in the southern sky. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7, which is quite bright. Bright stars should be easily detectable because they produce a strong signal.

b) Polaris: The North Star. It's not as bright as Canopus. Polaris has an apparent magnitude of around 1.97. So a bit dimmer than Canopus but still relatively bright. It should be detectable.

c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0 (which is the same as the celestial pole, but wait, no, RA 0h 0m is the same as the point (celestial equator, right ascension 0h). But wait, DEC 0 is on the celestial equator. So regardless, the star's distance and absolute magnitude are key.

Wait, option c: Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15, located at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude would be Mv + distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log (d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So for 10 pc:

Distance modulus = 5 * log(10/10) = 5 * 0 = 0. So apparent magnitude (mv) is 15 + 0 = 15. That's very dim.

But wait, how does the apparent magnitude relate to the S/N?

ESPRESSO's sensitivity: I think for a given exposure time, the S/N depends on the star's brightness (apparent magnitude). The fainter the star (higher magnitude), the lower the S/N.

So the question is, what is the faintest star (highest apparent magnitude) that ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of 10 per pixel in one hour.

I need to find the faintest star for which S/N >=10.

ESPRESSO's S/N per pixel is determined by the star's flux. The formula relating S/N and magnitude is something like S/N = 10^(-0.4*(mv - mv0)), where mv0 is the magnitude for a S/N of 10. But I don't remember the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: The number of photons received per second is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * mv). The S/N for a certain exposure time is sqrt(N_photons), because S/N scales with the square root of the number of photons.

Wait, more accurately, the S/N ratio is proportional to sqrt(t * 10^(-0.4 * mv)), where t is the exposure time in seconds.

So to get S/N >=10, we can set up the equation:

sqrt(t
