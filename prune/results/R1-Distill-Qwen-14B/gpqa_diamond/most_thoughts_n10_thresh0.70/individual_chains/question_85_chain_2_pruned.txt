Alright, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is calculated using the formula derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Oh wait, albedo is the same for both planets here, so that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

The star's parameters are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii, but the question is about temperature ratio, so I don't think mass affects this directly. Maybe the radius of the planet affects the transit method, but for temperature, it's the star's characteristics and the planet's distance from the star that matter.

Wait, but how do I find the distance of each planet from the star? Oh, right! The radial velocity method gives us the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (distance). The transit method gives the radius. But in this question, we have some data about the Doppler shifts.

The star's [OI] line at 6300 Å has shifts due to each planet. The RV shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV shift (delta lambda) is (v/c) * lambda_0, where v is the velocity, lambda_0 is the rest wavelength, and c is the speed of light. So for each planet, delta lambda is given, and from that, we can find their velocities, and then their distances using Kepler's third law.

Let me jot down the given data:

Star: M = 1.5 Msun, R = 1.2 Rsun, Teff = 6300 K.

Planet1: M =7 Earth masses, R =1.7 Earth radii. RV shift: 0.03 Å.

Planet2: M=5 Earth masses, R=1.3 Earth radii. RV shift:0.04 Å.

Both shifts are in [OI] line at 6300 Å. So for each planet, delta lambda is given.

The RV formula: delta lambda / lambda_0 = (v_star) / c.

So v_star = (delta lambda / lambda_0) * c.

Wait, let me compute v for each planet.

For Planet1, delta lambda is 0.03 Å. The line is at 6300 Å, so 6300 Angstroms.

So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c.

Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04 /6300)*c.

But wait, in reality, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ), but that's probably more complicated. Alternatively, since both planets are orbiting the same star, and we can assume their semi-major axes are different, but their velocities relate inversely with the square root of the semi-major axis (since v = sqrt(G M_star / a), assuming a circular orbit).

Wait, let me think again. The semi-amplitude K (the maximum RV shift) is given by the formula:

K = (v_star) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/ ) ) * something. Maybe I'm getting mixed up here.

Alternatively, K is approximately ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) )^(1/ ) ) * (1/(a (1 - e^2) ) ). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between velocity and semi-major axis.

Given that for circular orbits (e=0), the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ ) * (1 / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5) )

But since e=0, and sin i is assumed to be 1 (edge-on orbit for transit), then this simplifies.

Wait, but another approach: For a star and planet system, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v_star) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps I can find a simpler relation. Let me recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital velocity of the star, which is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the distance.

Wait, the star's velocity v_star is related to the planet's velocity v_planet by the mass ratio. Because the planet and star orbit their common center of mass, so M_star * a_star = M_planet * a_planet. So a_star = (M_planet / M_star) * a_planet.

Since the star's velocity is v_star = (2 pi a_star) / P, and the planet's velocity is v_planet = (2 pi a_planet) / P. So v
