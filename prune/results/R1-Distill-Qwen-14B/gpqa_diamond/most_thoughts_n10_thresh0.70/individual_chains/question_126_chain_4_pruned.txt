Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again.

Alright, the problem describes two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks the chemist will observe in each type of chromatogram.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction does. Let's break them down one by one.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. So, I'm thinking that the ketone in hexan-3-one will be reduced. Wait, hexan-3-one is a ketone at position 3. LAH usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the product after reduction would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration of the new stereocenter depends on the starting material. Wait, no, the starting material is a secondary alcohol? No, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the ketone is at C3.

So hexan-3-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, wait. Let me structure it. Hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2 groups on either side. But wait, the substituents would be... Let me draw it. 

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: The main chain is six carbons, with a ketone at C3. So, positions: 1, 2, 3 (carbonyl), 4, 5, 6. At C5, there's a methoxy group. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Or wait, wait. Wait, no, because hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(
