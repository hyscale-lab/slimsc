Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, that notation might be a bit confusing. Oh right, I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors. So (3i, 4) would be a column vector with the first component 3i and the second 4. So the state vector χ is:

χ = [3i; 4].

Wait, but wait a second. Spin states are typically normalized, right? So the first thing I should do is check if this vector is normalized. To normalize, I calculate the inner product of the vector with itself. The inner product is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) because χ† would be the conjugate transpose. Wait, no, wait. The inner product is χ† times χ. So for the given vector, the conjugate transpose would be [ -3i, 4 ] because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 is real.

So the inner product is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [3i;4]. Let me calculate that. The first term is (-3i)(3i) = (-9i²) = (-9)(-1) =9. The second term is 4*4=16. Adding them, 9+16=25. So the norm is 25. So the state isn't normalized yet. Oh, but wait, the problem might just give the state as (3i,4), and we might have to use it as is without normalization. Hmm, because the question is about the expectation value, which involves the state as given.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, expectation values are calculated using the formula <S> = χ† S χ. But for expectation values, we usually use the
