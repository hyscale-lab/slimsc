Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy it provides to a nucleus. The question states that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I need to find the energy of the RHIC such that this speed is achieved. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different GeV values.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6, because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

Now, I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a moving object is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So the formula is E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I'll plug that in.

Let me calculate gamma first. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2/(c²) = 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that would be sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.96 * 0.96. Let me do that: 96 * 96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216. Yes. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is exactly 100/28, which simplifies to 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. Lithium-6 has a mass number A=6, so it's made of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest mass energy can be calculated using the mass of a proton and neutron.

Wait, but wait: the mass of a nucleus isn't exactly the sum of protons and neutrons because of binding energy, but in particle physics, when calculating things like this, I think we usually take the rest mass as the sum of individual particles. Or wait, no, maybe the actual rest mass is better taken from a table.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-
