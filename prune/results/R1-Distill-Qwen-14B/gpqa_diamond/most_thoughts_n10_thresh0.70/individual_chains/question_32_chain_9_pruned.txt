Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking me to find the energy of RHIC such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably start by understanding what the nucleus X is. Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium usually has an atomic number of 3, so the number of protons is 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the total number of nucleons is 3 + 3 = 6. Oh wait, that's carbon? No, no, wait. Lithium-6. Because Li normally has 3 protons and typically around 4 neutrons (like Li-7), but here it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which is a beryllium isotope? No, wait, no. Li-6 is a stable isotope of lithium with 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Right.

So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. Since the speed v is 0.96c, that's pretty high, so relativistic effects are significant. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0 c². But wait, what's gamma? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So I need to calculate gamma for v=0.96c. Let me compute that. Let me calculate v squared over c squared: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, more accurately: 0.28 times 3.5714 is 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1, so yes, that's correct. So gamma is about 3.5714 or more accurately, perhaps, let's compute 0.96 squared exactly. 0.96 *0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Wait, 0.28 squared is 0
