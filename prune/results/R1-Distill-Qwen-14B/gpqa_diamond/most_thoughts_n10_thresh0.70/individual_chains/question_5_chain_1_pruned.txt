Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, specifically for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

First, let's unpack the information given. The operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

The problem gives me the matrices for each component:

- P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- P_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- P_z is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

I remember that the operator P is a vector operator, so it can be expressed as P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z, where n is a unit vector. In this case, n lies in the x-z plane, which means the y-component of n (n_y) is zero. So, the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

Wait, but n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. That means n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Alternatively, sometimes θ is measured from the x-axis, but I think in this context it's more likely polar coordinates with θ from the z-axis. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe that's a detail I'll have to come back to.

But wait, the eigenvector is for P along n, so the operator we need is P·n. So, I should construct the matrix for P·n. Let me write that out.

P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting the matrices, that would be:

P·n = (n_x * ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * ħ/2 [[1,0],[0,-1]])

Let me compute that. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x],
              [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, wait, let me double-check that matrix multiplication. So,

n_x P_x = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, n_x (ħ/2)], [n_x (ħ/2), 0]]
n_z P_z = n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[n_z (ħ/2), 0], [0, -n_z (ħ/2)]]

Adding these together:

First row: [n_z (ħ/2), n_x (ħ/2)]
Second row: [n_x (ħ/2), -n_z (ħ/2)]

So, the matrix is (ħ/2) times [[n_z,
