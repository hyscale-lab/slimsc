Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. The problem gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and asks about the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. All have an albedo of 0.3, same as Earth.

Hmm, TTV stands for transit timing variations, but I don't think that's directly relevant here. The key info is about equilibrium temperatures and masses. Wait, equilibrium temperature relates to the planet's distance from its star, right? And the orbital period would depend on that distance as well, according to Kepler's laws.

So, let's get the given data:

Equilibrium temperature ratios:
- Planet1 to Planet2 (T1/T2) = 1.4
- Planet2 to Planet3 (T2/T3) = 2.3

Mass ratios:
- Planet1 to Planet2 (M1/M2) = 1.15
- Planet2 to Planet3 (M2/M3) = 1.35

We need to find the ratio of orbital periods P3/P1.

First, I think equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

Te = ( ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D^2) )^(1/4)

Wait, but actually, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So when you rearrange, T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). But since L (the star's luminosity) and albedo (a) are the same for all three planets, the ratio of temperatures only depends on the distance D.

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 ) ?

Wait, no. Let me think
