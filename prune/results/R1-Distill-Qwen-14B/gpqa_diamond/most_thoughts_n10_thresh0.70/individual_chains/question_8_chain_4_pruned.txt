Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine plants to find genes that contribute to resistance against a fungal disease called anthracnose. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They created knock-out mutants for each of these (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The key point they mention is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. So, knowing that, the arrangement of these genes in a pathway could be important.

They tested these mutants for resistance to the pathogen. The results are as follows:
- g1: 75% resistance (so, 25% less than control)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half the control)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm, wait. Let me think about what these results could mean. 

First, looking at the single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So the plant is less resistant but still has some resistance. So knocking out G1 doesn't completely lose resistance.
- g2 is 0%, so no resistance. So plants without G2 are completely susceptible. That suggests that G2 might be a critical gene for resistance, perhaps a transcription factor that's essential for activating other defense genes.
- g3: 50% resistance. So knocking out G3 cuts the resistance in half.

Now, the double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% resistance. So even worse than either single mutant (g1 at 75, g3 at 50). It's much lower. So combining g1 and g3 mutations makes things much worse.
- g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2. So when g2 is knocked out, adding g3 doesn't change the resistance—it's still zero. That makes sense if G2 is upstream of G3. Because if G2 isn't working, then G3's function isn't needed anymore because the pathway is already blocked. So the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant (g2 here, which is 0%).
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2. So again, when G2 is not working, the other gene's state doesn't matter. The resistance is gone.

So from this, it seems like G2 is a critical gene, possibly a transcription factor that's upstream of G1 and G3. Let's think about the epistatic relationships here. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. 

In this case, the g2 mutants are completely susceptible. When you have the double mutants involving g2, like g2g3 or g2g1, the resistance is the same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because no matter what happens to G1 or G3, if G2 isn't working, the resistance isn't there. So G2 is acting upstream.

So G2 is a transcription factor. It's acting upstream of G1 and G3. So G2's product is required for the function of G1 and G3. Or, more accurately, G2 is necessary for the expression of these downstream genes.

Now, looking at the other mutants: g1 and g3. 

When G1 is knocked out (g1), resistance is 75%, so it's still somewhat resistant. When G3 is knocked out (g3), resistance is 50%. So both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, but G1 has a bigger impact (since 75% is higher than 50%). But not as much as G2, which brings it down to zero.

The double mutant g1g3 has resistance at 10%, which is lower than either single. So the effects are additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways or contribute to the same pathway in a non-overlapping way. Alternatively, they might be in separate branches of a pathway that both contribute to resistance.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but I thought G2 was the transcription factor. Option A says G1 is a TF. But the data suggests that G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, which is more severe than G1's. So perhaps G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (pleiotropy?), G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, but I don't know if that's the case. Alternatively, if they're in the same pathway, but the data doesn't directly show that.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure if that's what's happening here. The data shows that G1 and G3 each affect resistance, but how?

Wait, the double mutant g1g3 gives resistance of 10%, which is much lower than either single. So their effects are additive, which suggests they function in parallel pathways. If they were in the same pathway, their double mutant might not be more severe than each single.

So, if G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways (each contributing to resistance), then knocking both out would have an additive effect. So that's more about redundancy or parallel pathways, not necessarily pleiotropy.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either single, which suggests that they don't compensate—
