Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. The field f(r) falls off as 1/r² and is radial, so only the radial component is non-zero. The volume is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, what's the divergence of a vector field? Oh right, divergence measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. For a vector field F = F_r r̂ + F_θ θ̂ + F_φ φ̂, the divergence is (1/r²)(d/dr (r² F_r) ) + (1/(r sinθ))(d/dθ (F_θ sinθ)) ) + (1/(r sinθ))(d/dφ (F_φ) )/(1)). But in this case, since the field only has a radial component and it's spherically symmetric, the other terms (θ and φ) should be zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

Wait, but F_r is given as 1/r². So substituting that in, let's compute it. The divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ].

Wait, r squared times 1 over r squared is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence of F is zero? That would mean the volume integral is zero. But wait, wait, that
