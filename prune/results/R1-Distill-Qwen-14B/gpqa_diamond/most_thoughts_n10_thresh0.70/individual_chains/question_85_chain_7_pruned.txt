Okay, so I have this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, like the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the albedo is the same for both planets here, so I can probably ignore that part.

The question gives me data on the star and the two planets. Let me jot down the key points:

Star:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses
- Radius: 1.2 solar radii
- Effective temperature (Teff): 6300 K

Planets:
Planet1:
- Mass: 7 Earth masses
- Radius: 1.7 Earth radii
- Induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å.

Planet2:
- Mass: 5 Earth masses
- Radius: 1.3 Earth radii
- Induces a shift of 0.04 Å in the same line.

Wait, the shifts are from the transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method measures the change in brightness as the planet passes in front of the star, while the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to move. 

But wait, the question says that both planets have been detected using both methods. So, the RV method gives the mass of the planet, and the transit gives the radius, I think. But how does the shift relate to the planet's orbital period and distance from the star?

Wait, the problem mentions the shifts in the same forbidden line. The RV method's shift is due to the Doppler effect. The formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta_lambda / lambda = (v/c), where v is the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.
