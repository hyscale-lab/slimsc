Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, meaning there are two substituents attached to the benzene. The benzene has 6 carbons, and the molecule as a whole has 8 carbons. So the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, no, actually, the substituents could be more complex. Let me think: benzene (6 C) plus substituents. Di-substituted, so two groups attached.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is Br, Cl, I, etc.). So the substituents are likely a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, wait. The carbonyl could be part of another group, like an ester or ketone.

Wait, the carbonyl could be in a carbonyl group attached to the benzene. So substituents could be, say, a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Let me think about possible structures.

If the benzene ring has two substituents, one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, etc.) and another is a halogen. But wait, that would add two substituents, making the total carbons from substituents as (1 for the carbonyl group) plus (probably 1 for the halogen, but halogens don't add carbons). Wait, but the total carbons in the compound are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents must account for 2 more carbons. So each substituent must contribute one carbon. Wait, but a carbonyl group like a ketone would be a substituent like R-C=O. Wait, a ketone group attached to the ring would be a single carbon (like a methyl ketone: Ar-C(O)-CH3? No, that would add more than one carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an acyl
