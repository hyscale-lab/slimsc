Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

The options are A to D, each with a different value in GeV. I need to calculate the energy the RHIC must provide so that the nucleus moves at 0.96c. 

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Given v is 0.96c, so let me plug that in. v² is (0.96c)^2, which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, since 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714... approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the total energy. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m c²).

So I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Wait, I think the exact values might be slightly different, but for this problem, perhaps I can approximate. Let me think: how many protons and neutrons are in Li-6?

Li has atomic number 3, which is the number of protons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons, as given. So total nucleons are 6.

So the rest mass energy would be (3 * proton mass) + (3 * neutron mass). But wait, I think the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy, but when calculating rest mass for relativistic energies, I think we just sum the individual masses. Or wait, no—wait, the rest mass of the nucleus is actually the sum of the masses minus the binding energy (which is why the actual mass is slightly less than the sum). But this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use the total mass as the sum of individual protons and neutrons.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value for the mass of Li-6 is known. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Because each u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so the rest mass energy would be 6.014 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let me calculate that.

6.014 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.014 * 931.5 ≈ Let me compute that.

6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.014 * 931.5 is about 13.041. So total is 5589 + 13.041 = 5602.041 MeV, which is about 5.602 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. Actually, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01410175 u. So let me compute that more accurately.

6.01410175 * 931.5 MeV:

Let me break it down:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.01410175 * 931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315
0.00410175 *931.5 ≈ let's compute 0.004 *931.5=3.726, and 0.00010175 *931.5≈0.0947. So total is 3.726 +0.0947≈3.8207.

So adding up 9.315 + 3.8207 ≈13.1357 MeV.

So total is 5589 +13.1357 ≈5602.1357 MeV, which is 5.6021 GeV approximately.

So the rest mass energy is about 5.6021 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by this rest mass energy. So gamma is about 3.5714, so 3.5714 *5.6021 GeV.

Let me calculate that.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857, and 3.5714 *0.6021 ≈ Let me compute 3.5714 *0.6 =2.14284. 3.5714 *0.0021 ≈0.0075. So total is approx 2.14284 +0.0075≈2.1503. So total E is 17.857 +2.1503≈19.007 GeV.

Wait, but that would be around 19 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher, and option D is 21.419, which is even higher. Option A is 18.475, which is a bit lower than my initial estimate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the rest mass energy more accurately. Let me find the exact value for the mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact rest mass. Wait, I'm just a student, so I don't have exact data. But I can perhaps find the approximate value.

Wait, another approach: The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but that can't be right because the actual mass of Li-6 is less than that due to binding energy, right? So the actual rest mass is the sum minus the binding energy. But perhaps in this problem, we're supposed to use the sum of the individual masses. Hmm, that's a point of confusion. Because if you use the exact mass of the nucleus, it's less than the sum of the individual nucleons.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the mass of the nucleus as (number of nucleons) * average mass, but perhaps I should just proceed with the sum.

Wait, but wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually about 6.0141 u. Each u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.0141 *931.5 = Let me compute that accurately.

Let me compute 6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.0141 *931.5 = Let me compute it as 0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.0041 *931.5=3.81915. So total for 0.0141 is 9.315 +3.81915=13.13415.

So total is 5589 +13.13415=5602.13415 MeV, which is 5.60213 GeV.

So the rest mass is about 5.6021 GeV.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 ≈3.5714.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.6021 ≈ let's compute that.

3.5714 *5.6021 = ?

Let me compute 3.5 *5.6021 = 19.60735.

Then 0.0714 *5.6021 ≈ 0.0714*5=0.357, 0.0714*.6021≈0.043. So total ≈0.357+0.043=0.400.

So sum is 19.60735 +0.400=20.007 GeV.

Wait, 3.5714 multiplied by 5.6021:

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

3.5714 *5.6021.

Let me break it down:

5.6021 *3 = 16.8063

5.6021 *0.5 =2.80105

5.6021 *0.07 =0.392147

5.6021 *0.0014≈0.00784294

Adding them up: 16.8063 +2.80105=19.60735.

Then 19.60735 +0.392147=19.999497.

Then 19.999497 +0.00784294≈20.00734 GeV.

So approximately 20.0073 GeV.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made some approximation errors in the calculations. Let me check gamma again.

Wait, v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - (v²/c²) )= 1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, since 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So more accurately, 3.57142857 *5.602134 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.602134.

Let me do it step by step.

3 *5.602134 =16.806402.

0.5*5.602134=2.801067.

0.07142857 *5.602134 ≈0.07142857 *5.602134.

Wait, 0.07 *5.602134=0.39214938.

0.00142857 *5.602134≈0.007999999.

So 0.39214938 +0.007999999≈0.40014938.

Now, adding all parts:

16.806402 +2.801067=19.607469.

19.607469 +0.40014938=20.007618 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.124 GeV higher than my calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise value for the mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01410175 u. Let me compute 6.01410175 *931.5 MeV/u.

6.01410175 *931.5:

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01410175 *931.5.

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.00410175 *931.5: Let me compute that.

0.004 *931.5=3.726 MeV.

0.00010175 *931.5=0.0944 MeV (approx).

So 3.726 +0.0944=3.8204 MeV.

So total for 0.01410175 is 9.315 +3.8204=13.1354 MeV.

Wait, wait, no: 0.01410175 is 0.01 + 0.00410175. So 0.01 *931.5=9.315, and 0.00410175 *931.5=3.8204. So total is 9.315 +3.8204=13.1354 MeV.

Adding to 5589, total is 5589 +13.1354=5602.1354 MeV=5.6021354 GeV.

So rest mass energy is 5.6021354 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.6021354.

Let me compute that more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6021354.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6021354 = ?

Well, 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0021354= let's compute that.

0.0021354 *3.57142857 ≈0.007646.

So 2.142857142 +0.007646 ≈2.150503.

Now, adding the two parts: 17.85714285 +2.150503 ≈20.0076458 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but I'm getting about 20.0076 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Another thought: the rest mass could be calculated using the actual atomic mass, which includes electrons, but for a nucleus, perhaps I should not include the electrons. Wait, no, wait: the nucleus doesn't include electrons. So the mass of Li-6 is 6.01410175 u, which is the mass of the nucleus, so the rest mass energy is correct.

Wait another thought: maybe the mass is being treated as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, without considering binding energy. Let me check that.

Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron about 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272=2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total:2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Then gamma is 3.57142857, so E =5.633511 *3.57142857.

Compute that:

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.633511 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857≈0.11929.

So 2.142857142 +0.11929≈2.262147.

Adding to 17.85714285: 17.85714285 +2.262147≈20.1192898 GeV.

So approximately 20.1193 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the intended approach is to sum the individual masses of the nucleons without considering binding energy.

So with that, the energy would be approximately 20.1193 GeV, which rounds to about 20.119 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the mass used is for the entire Li atom, including electrons, but that's unlikely because the nucleus is considered. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the rest mass to be calculated as (mass number) * average mass of nucleon.

The mass number A is 6, and if each nucleon is about 938 MeV/c², then 6 *938=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So with gamma 3.5714, E=3.5714 *5.628≈20.08 GeV. Hmm, that's still a bit under 20.132.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation with more precise values would get closer to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

v =0.96c.

beta = v/c =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28.

But 0.28^2=0.0784 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So perhaps it's better to use more precise rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual mass is 5.6021 GeV, leading to around 20.0076 GeV, but the closest option is C, 20.132 GeV. But that's a bit off. Wait, maybe I should check if I made a calculation mistake elsewhere.

Another approach: perhaps the energy isn't just gamma * m c². Wait, no, for a particle moving at speed v, the total energy is indeed gamma m c².

Wait, wait, perhaps I should consider the rest mass in terms of actual atomic masses, but without the electrons. Let me get back to that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the precise mass of Li-6, which is 6.01410175 u. So let me compute 6.01410175 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6.01410175 × 931.5:

I can compute this as:

6 × 931.5 =5589.

0.01410175 ×931.5.

Let me compute 0.01 ×931.5=9.315.

0.00410175 ×931.5: let me compute that.

0.00410175 = 4101.75e-6.

So 4101.75e-6 *931.5 = ?

Wait, alternatively, 0.004 *931.5=3.726.

0.00010175 *931.5= approx 0.0944 (since 0.0001 *931.5=0.09315, so 0.00010175 is a bit more, say 0.0944).

So 3.726 +0.0944=3.8204.

So 0.01410175 ×931.5 =9.315 +3.8204=13.1354 MeV.

So total is 5589 +13.1354=5602.1354 MeV=5.6021354 GeV.

So back to E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6021354 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.57142857 ×5.6021354.

Let me write this as:

3.57142857 ×5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6021354.

Compute each part:

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.0021354.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.002 = 0.007142857.

3.57142857 ×0.0001354=0.0004835.

So 0.007142857 +0.0004835≈0.007626357.

So the 0.6021354 part is 2.142857142 +0.007626357 ≈2.1504835.

Adding to the initial 17.85714285:

17.85714285 +2.1504835 ≈20.00762635 GeV.

So approximately 20.0076 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. My calculation is about 20.0076, which is very close to 20 GeV. But option C is a bit higher. Why the discrepancy?

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the rest mass. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the problem might be considering the mass of the entire Li atom, including electrons. Let me see.

Lithium has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So 3 electrons contribute 3 *0.511 =1.533 MeV, which is negligible compared to the nucleus mass. So including them probably doesn't make a significant difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, without considering the binding energy. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV.

Wait, no, that would be 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV =5.6335 GeV.

So E=3.5714 *5.6335.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6335 = let's compute:

3.5714 *0.6=2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0335= approx 0.1196.

So 2.14284 +0.1196 ≈2.2624.

So total E≈17.857 +2.2624=20.1194 GeV.

That's about 20.119 GeV. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, not the actual atomic mass.

So the correct energy would be approximately 20.119 GeV, which is closest to option C (20.132 GeV). Perhaps due to rounding, it's 20.132.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using approximate values for the proton and neutron masses (\( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m_{\text{Li-6}} = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_{\text{Li-6}} \approx 5.6335 \, \text{GeV} \) into the energy equation:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6335 \approx 2.262
\]

\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.262 = 20.119 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.119 \, \text{GeV} \), which is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or slight differences in the assumed masses of the nucleons.

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC required to accelerate the Li-6 nucleus to \( 0.96c \) is best matched by option C.

**Answer: C**
