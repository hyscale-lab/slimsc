Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that Gaussian states are states that have a Wigner function which is Gaussian, like coherent states or squeezed states. Non-Gaussian states are those that don't fit into that category, and they're important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can demonstrate some interesting phenomena that Gaussian states can't.

The problem gives me the state |psi> as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I think |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. And N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)).

The non-Gaussianity is being measured using relative entropy, which is given by del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Oh wait, I remember that the relative entropy between two states is also known as the quantum Kullback-Leibler divergence. But wait, the formula here seems a bit off. Usually, relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho - rho ln tau). So if rho is the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state, then del_b is exactly this expression.

But wait, the way the question is phrased, del_b is given as the difference of their entropy terms. So the non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using this relative entropy.

Now, the task is to compute the nG for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Hmm, but wait, the options include D) 0. How could that be? Well, if the state is Gaussian, then nG would be zero. But the state given is a superposition of two coherent states, which is a non-Gaussian state. So unless under some circumstances, it's Gaussian.

Wait, but wait a second. For specific values of phi and alpha, could this state become Gaussian? Let me think.
