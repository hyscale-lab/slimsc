Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a certain nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So, lithium typically has 3 protons, right? If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. But wait, actually, lithium usually has isotopes. Li-6 is a common isotope, I think.

So the nucleus in question is Li-6. I need to calculate the energy of RHIC so that the nucleus reaches a speed of 0.96 times the speed of light. The options are given in GeV, so I'll need to calculate the total energy and then choose the correct option.

First, I remember that relativistic energy is given by the equation E = gamma * m_0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Given v is 0.96c. Let me compute gamma first. So v squared is (0.96c)^2, which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.0784, sqrt of that. Hmm, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Yes, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is approximately 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Since Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 pro
