Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can sometimes be written in terms of coordinates, and the form might resemble something from geometry or relativity.

So, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I think a pseudosphere is a type of surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, what's a pseudosphere's area? I remember that for a regular sphere, the area is 4πr², but a pseudosphere is different because of its negative curvature.

Let me think about the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So, the denominator would be zero when x² + y² = 4, which is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the coordinates x and y must satisfy x² + y² < 4, I guess. So the domain is like a disk of radius 2.

Wait, but the metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So this is a two-dimensional metric. The line element depends on position, so it's a curved space.

Wait, how do you compute the area in such a space? I think the area element would be sqrt(determinant of the metric tensor) times dx dy. The metric
