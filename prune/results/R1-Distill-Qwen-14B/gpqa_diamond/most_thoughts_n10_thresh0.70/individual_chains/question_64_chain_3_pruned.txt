Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200Â°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were passed through three tubes in succession. 

The first tube had anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The second was a Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third had red-hot copper. The results were that tubes 1 and 3 gained 3.60g and 0.80g respectively. Tube 2 didn't change in weight. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let's break this down. So, heating salts A and B in the absence of air probably caused them to decompose. Since the decomposition produced gases, maybe the salts are carbonates or sulfites that release CO2 or SO2, but let's think.

Then, the gases passed through the tubes. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, anhydrous. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent and is used to dry gases. Wait, no. Wait, I think Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb moisture. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up with other drying agents. Alternatively, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant. So, when a gas passes through it, any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed, increasing the tube's weight. So, the weight gain in tube 1 is due to water captured.

So, tube 1 gained 3.60g, which is the mass of water vapor in the gas mixture. So, the total mass of water in the gases is 3.60g.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. When a gas is passed through a solution of Ca(OH)2, it would react if the gas is acidic. But the tube's weight didn't change. So, maybe no reaction took place. That suggests that the gas wasn't CO2 or something that would react with Ca(OH)2. Wait, but if the gas didn't cause any reaction, that might mean the gas is inert or couldn't react under those conditions. Alternatively, perhaps all the acidic gases were already absorbed in the first tube, but I'm not sure.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. The gas passed through it, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80g, with CuO formed. So, this suggests that the gas was something that reacts with copper when heated. Oh, right! CO2 doesn't react with red-hot copper, but maybe CO would. Wait, no, CO would react with copper under certain conditions.
