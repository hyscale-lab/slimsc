Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can figure it out.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, what could that be? C3H6 has the molecular formula which could be propene (propylene), cyclopropane, or maybe something else. But wait, the next reaction is bromination in CCl4, which makes me think about addition reactions. Like, if A is an alkene, bromination would probably be an addition. So propene makes sense because it's an alkene and would add bromine.

So A is propene, which is CH2=CH2CH3. When it undergoes bromination in CCl4, that's a typical dibromination via the bromonium ion mechanism. So adding Br2 across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So this is likely an elimination reaction, E2 mechanism. When vicinal dihalides (like B) react with a strong base, they eliminate to form alkenes. So B would lose two HBr molecules to form an alkene. The structure would be propene again, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When eliminating, the base would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. The possible product would be propene. But wait, which isomer? The base is alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, so it might lead to more substituted alkenes due to Zaitsev's rule.

Wait, but propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when B, 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminates two HBr molecules, it would form propene. So compound C is propene again? Wait, that seems a bit circular. Or maybe I got the structure wrong.

Wait, when 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3) eliminates, it would form 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait: 1,
