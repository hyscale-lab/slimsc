Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position of the particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. Hmm.

Wait, so each particle's wave function is this expression. But wait, the wave function should satisfy the normalization condition, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that down: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5 i. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function. However, the probability density is given by the square of the absolute value of ψ(x), which is ψ*(x) ψ(x), where * denotes the complex conjugate.

Wait, but looking at ψ(x), it's a complex function. Let's compute |ψ(x)|². The absolute square is [ψ*(x)] * [ψ(x)]. So ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the complex conjugate is (a / sqrt(1+x)) plus 0.5i. Multiply them together.

Let me compute that. Let’s denote A = a / sqrt(1+x). Then ψ(x) = A - 0.5i, and ψ*(x) = A + 0.5i. So the product is (A + 0.5i)(A -0.5i) = A² + (0.5i)(-A i) + (0.5i)(A (-i)) + ... Wait, no, wait, it's just (A)^2 + (0.5)^2 because (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². Wait, wait, no. Because (A - i B)(A + i B) = A² + (i B)(-i B) + ... No, wait, (A - i B)(A + i B) = A² + (i B)(-i B) + ... wait, no, actually, it's (A)^2 + (B)^2, because (i B)(-i B) = (i)(-i) B² = (1) B². So yeah, |ψ(x)|² = A² + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

Now, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

Wait, that's because the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function is zero outside of that region. So the integral from 1 to 3 of (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx = 1.

So let's compute that integral. Let me break it into two parts: the integral of a²/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

First integral: a² ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209.

Then a is the square root, so sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849. Hmm, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.7209. The square root of 0.72 is about 0.8485. Since 0.8485^2 = 0.72. So a is approximately 0.8485.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B) 0.85.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculation.

The integral of 1/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2), correct.

The 0.25*2 is 0.5.

So equation: a² * ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209.

sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849, which rounds to 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition in quantum mechanics, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in the allowed region (between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \)) must equal 1. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x)\psi(x) \), where \( \psi^*(x) \) is the complex conjugate of \( \psi(x) \).

### Step 1: Compute \( |\psi(x)|^2 \)
The wave function is \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), and its complex conjugate is \( \psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i \). The absolute square is:
\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

### Step 2: Apply the normalization condition
The normalization condition is:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]
Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \), the integral becomes:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]
This can be split into two parts:
\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

### Step 3: Compute the integrals
1. **First integral**: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \)
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from 1 to 3:
   \[
   \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**: \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \)
   The integral of \( dx \) from 1 to 3 is \( 3 - 1 = 2 \). Thus:
   \[
   0.25 \times 2 = 0.5
   \]

### Step 4: Combine results
Substituting the results into the normalization condition:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]
Simplify:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( a \)
Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7209
\]
\[
a = \sqrt{0.7209} \approx 0.849
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The closest value to \( 0.849 \) among the given options is \( 0.85 \).

**Answer: B**
