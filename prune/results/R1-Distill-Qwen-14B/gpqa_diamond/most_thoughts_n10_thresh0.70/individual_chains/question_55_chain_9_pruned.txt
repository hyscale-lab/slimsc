Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to identify an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are four different esters: Cis and Trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, I should recall what these compounds look like. Propenyl acetate would have an acetyl group (OAc) attached to a propenyl group. The propenyl group is CH2CHCH2, but wait, no, wait. Actually, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terminology. Let me think. Acetate esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R', right? Wait, no, the structure is the acetyl group attached to an oxygen, and the rest is the R group. So for propenyl acetate, it's CH3COOCH2CHCH2? No, wait. Let me get that right. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, the propenyl group would have a double bond. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing butenyl and propenyl. Let me clarify:

Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, but attached as the ester. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? Wait, no, because propenyl is three carbons with a double bond. So the structure would be CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-; so the acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? But that would be 1-propenyl acetate, I think. Wait, but sometimes the numbering might be different, but perhaps that's the structure.

But then, for butenyl, it's four carbons with a double bond. So butenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CHCH2? No, wait, but where's the double bond? It depends on whether it's cis or trans.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the NMR data given. The data is: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

Let me analyze each part.

Looking at the peaks:

At 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant. 16 Hz suggests perhaps a double bond coupling, maybe between two vinyl protons. Wait, but 16 Hz is a bit high, but possible for a trans coupling in a di-substituted double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is another proton, a doublet of quartets (dq
