Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure out the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Hmm, let's think through this.

First, from what I remember, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Wait, is that right? So each atom has a certain probability per unit time of decaying, and the fact that it hasn't decayed before doesn't change its future probability. Oh wait, that sounds like the memoryless property of the exponential distribution.

So the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. I think that 32% is probably the cumulative probability over that 100 minutes, meaning P(decay in 100 minutes) = 0.32. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terminology here. So the decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes would translate to the probability that the atom decays at some point within that time.

The formula for the survival probability (the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t) is S(t) = e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant and t is time. So the decay probability over a time t is 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-位t).

We can use the given data to find 位. Given that P(100) =
