Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused because I don't remember all the formulas. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm, it's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Oh boy, that's a long one. I need to figure out the enthalpy of formation, and they've given some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon.

Wait, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The standard states are usually diatomic for H2, O2, etc. But here, the problem gives bond energies. So I think the approach here is to use the bond energies to calculate the enthalpy change.

I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula: ΔHf° = Σ (bonds broken) - Σ (bonds formed). Or wait, wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Because when you form bonds, you release energy (exothermic), so the bonds formed contribute negatively. Let me think: the total enthalpy change is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (bonds broken) minus the sum of the bond energies of the products (bonds formed). So ΔH = (sum of bonds broken) - (sum of bonds formed).

But wait, in this case, I'm not sure if it's the formation from elements. Because the given data is for bond energies, maybe I should calculate the enthalpy of the molecule by considering all the bonds in it.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the enthalpy of the molecule as if it's being formed from carbon and hydrogen atoms. So the process would involve breaking bonds in the elements (like C-C in graphite or something, but wait, the question gives enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, maybe I should use that.

Wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to produce atoms. For carbon, the bond energy is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C-C bond requires 1000 kJ to break, meaning that the bond energy is 1000 kJ per mole. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the bond energy is the energy released when
