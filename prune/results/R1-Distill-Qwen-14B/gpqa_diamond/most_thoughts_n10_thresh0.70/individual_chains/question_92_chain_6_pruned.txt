Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let's see, I think it's a diene or something with multiple double bonds. Wait, actually, looking closer, I count two double bonds. The structure has two C=C groups. So each double bond contributes to the structure.

The question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an atom into separate atoms. So, for carbon, it's 1000 kJ/mol. 

Wait, no, wait. Actually, bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. So, the bond energies given are for each type of bond. So, for example, each H-H bond is 100 kJ/mol, each C-C is 200, etc.

The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, which is an alkene, I think I can approach this using the bond energy method.

The formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) can be calculated by subtracting the sum of all bond energies in the reactants (the elements) from the sum of the bond energies in the products (the compound). But wait, wait. No, actually, I think it's the other way around. Or is it the sum of the bond energies broken minus the sum formed. Or maybe I should think in terms of the heat of formation being the sum of the energies of the bonds broken minus the bonds formed.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think of the formation as the sum of the energies of the bonds in the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bonds in the product. Or wait, maybe it's the reverse. Let me get this straight.

When a compound is formed, bonds are broken in the reactants (which are elements like C and H2) and new bonds are formed in the product. So, the enthalpy change (ΔH) would be [sum of bond energies broken in reactants] minus [sum of bond energies formed in product].

So, for the molecule here, which is an alkene, let's consider the formation reaction. The reaction would be:

Elements (C and H2) → Compound.

So, the bonds broken are C-C (but wait, in pure carbon, maybe graphite or diamond, but the question says enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm. Wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break a C-C bond into two C atoms. So that would be 1000 kJ per mole of C-C bonds. But wait, no, the atomization of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, wait, maybe the bond energy for C-C is given as 200 kJ/mol, so the bond energy is 200, but each C-C bond requires that much energy.

Wait, the problem states: Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, wait, that might be the energy required to break a mole of C-C bonds in solid carbon (like graphite) into gaseous carbon atoms. So each C-C bond has an energy of 1000 kJ/mol. But wait, no, that can't be right because in graphite each C is bonded to three others, so the bond energy is lower. Hmm, maybe the given 1000 is the atomization energy, which is the energy per mole to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon. So, for graphite, each C has three C-C bonds, so the atomization energy would be (3/2)*n*(bond energy). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy needed to split a mole of carbon into individual atoms. Since each mole of carbon has, say, in graphite, each C is bonded to three others. So the bond energy per C-C bond would be 1000 kJ per mole divided by the number of bonds. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

But perhaps I should proceed with the given data. The bond energies are given as:

C-C: 200 kJ/mol
C=C: 300 kJ/mol
C-H: 400 kJ/mol
H-H: 100 kJ/mol

Wait, but the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm. So maybe for C, the atomization is 1000 kJ per mole of
