Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. So, that means the number of stars isn't clumped together in any particular way; they're spread out evenly. But wait, how does that affect the number of stars per unit range of parallax?

Parallax, right. Parallax is a measure of distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Because parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/distance. So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, 2 parsecs is 0.5, etc.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with parallax. So, if I consider a small range of parallax, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

First, I need to think about the distribution in terms of distance. Since the parallax is inversely related to distance, a small change in parallax corresponds to a larger change in distance for larger parallaxes. Wait, no, actually, for a given change in parallax, how does the distance change?

Let me see. If plx is small, say plx = d, then distance is 1/d. So a change in plx of d would correspond to a change in distance of... Hmm, maybe I should approach this from the number density perspective.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed in space, which I think implies uniform in number per unit volume. So the number of stars in a small volume element depends on the size of that element.

But when you're considering a shell at a certain distance r, the volume of the shell (which is a thin spherical shell) is 4π r² dr. So as r increases, the volume of the shell increases with r squared.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. Parallax is 1/r, so r = 1/plx. So if I consider a small change in plx, dplx, then what is the corresponding change in r?

Let me compute that. r = 1/plx, so dr = (1/plx²) * dplx. Wait, no, derivative dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So if plx increases by d
