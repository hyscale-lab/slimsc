Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by understanding what's given.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, formula is C8H9NO. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plugging in, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let me compute that. 2*8 is 16, +2 is 18. 18 minus 9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. Divide by 2, that's 5 degrees of unsaturation. So that's five rings or double bonds or triple bonds. Each ring or double bond counts as one, each triple as two. So 5 could be a combination, maybe a benzene ring (three double bonds, but that's three degrees) plus a double bond or ring elsewhere, and maybe an ester or amide group? Not sure yet.

The NMR data is given. Let me try to parse that. The peaks are:

9.72 (t, 1H) – a triplet integrating to 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, as aldehydes are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons.

6.98 (d, 2H) – doublet, 2H. Maybe aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene, as para substituents would give a double doublet or something. Or perhaps part of a vinyl group.

6.51 (d, 2H) – another doublet, 2H. Could be another set of aromatic protons, maybe para substituted as well, or perhaps part of a conjugated system.

6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Broad usually implies exchange, like -OH protons, but here it's 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's protons adjacent to an electronegative atom or in a conjugated system, like an enol.

3.66 (d, 2H) – doublet, 2H. This could be a CH2 group connected to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. Maybe an ether, ester, or amine group.

So putting this together, perhaps the molecule has two aromatic rings. Let's think: the two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two para-substituted aromatic rings. The 6.27 could be an enol proton or something else, but the broadness is confusing. The 3.66 could be a CH2 connected to something, maybe O.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons. Let's think about possible structures. The NMR suggests possible conjugated systems.

Looking at the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl – that's typically a nitrous acid condition, used for diazotization, especially of aromatic amines. So maybe the starting compound has an aromatic amine group.

2. H2O – perhaps hydrolysis.

3. Aq KOH and heat – maybe elimination or saponification, or some kind of condensation.

Wait, but the reaction sequence is NaNO2/HCl, then H2O, then KOH and heat. Common reactions with diazonium salts: maybe coupling, or forming a hydroxylamine, or elimination.

Wait, but another possibility: the starting material has an amino group. So if we have an aromatic amine, it would get converted into a diazonium salt (with HNO2 and HCl, typically at low temps). Then, what happens when that is treated with H2O? Well, diazonium salts in aqueous conditions can undergo hydrolysis. If it's a para-substituted benzene, the diazonium group might undergo hydrolysis to form a hydroxyl group. For example, in a benzene ring with an amino group, it becomes a diazonium, and then in aqueous acid, it becomes a phenol.

But wait, in step 3, after H2O, we treat with aqueous KOH and heat. That's often used for elimination reactions, maybe to form a carbonyl group. Alternatively, in the presence of a diazonium salt and heat, sometimes elimination occurs, like forming a ketone from an amine.

Wait, let me think: the starting molecule has an amino group and a benzene ring. After diazotization, when heated, perhaps the amino group is replaced by a carbonyl group. For example, if the structure is a benzylamine with substituents, then the diazonium would form, and upon heating, lose N2 and form a carbonyl.

Wait, but the initial structure might not have
