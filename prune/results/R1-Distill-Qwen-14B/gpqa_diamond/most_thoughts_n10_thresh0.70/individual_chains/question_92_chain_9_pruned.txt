Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Right, so I need to figure out the structure of the compound given, then break it down into its constituent elements and calculate the energy changes.

Wait, the compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me draw its structure to visualize. So, it's a molecule with two double bonds. Each double bond is between carbons. The formula would be something like C12H20? Let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

Looking at each part: (CH3)2C is a propyl group with a double bondâ€”so that's 3 carbons. Then C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3) adds more. Wait, maybe it's easier to count all the carbons. Let's see: (CH3)2C is 3 carbons, then another C in the double bond, so next is CH2, then CH(CH3), then CH2, then another CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, wait, maybe the formula is C12H22? Or maybe I should count each part:

Each (CH3)2C group: that's 3 carbons (from the two CH3 groups and the central C).

Then C=CH-: that's two more carbons, but wait, the double bond is between the first and second C in that part. So, maybe the chain is longer.

Wait, maybe I should sketch it out mentally. The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: this is (CH2CH2CH2?), no. Wait, (CH3)2C=CH- is a group where the carbon chain is (CH2)2C=CH-. So that's four carbons (the two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is double-bonded to another C). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each part:

Actually, let me try to figure out the molecular formula. Each (CH3) group is CH3, so two of them attached to a C: so that's 2*(3 H) + 1 C (from the central C) = a group of 3 C and 6 H? Wait, no, because (CH3)2C=CH- would be:

The structure: C(CH3)2=CH- . So each CH3 is 3 H, so two of them contribute 6 H, and the central C is connected to the C in the double bond. So the group is C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula of the compound can be determined. Let's count the number of carbons and hydrogens in each segment.

Starting with (CH3)2C=CH-: that's 3 carbons (two CH3 and one central C) plus one more C in
