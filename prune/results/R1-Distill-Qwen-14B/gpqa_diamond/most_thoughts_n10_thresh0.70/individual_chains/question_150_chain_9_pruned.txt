Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and there are three reagents used in a reaction sequence. My task is to identify the final product from the given options.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR is given in ppm with the following signals:

- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

I need to interpret this to determine the structure of the starting compound. Then, I'll follow the reaction steps to find out what the product is.

Starting with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2). Wait, wait, for each degree, it's (2n + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Let me plug in the numbers.

C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds, or maybe multiple rings or triple bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:

The first peak is at 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, that's a triplet. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets. But maybe it's near some other protons. Or perhaps it's an enol form or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton. Wait, 9.72 could also be a conjugated aldehyde, like in a benzaldehyde derivative. 

Another thought: if it's an aldehyde, the triplet suggests that the aldehyde proton is split by two neighboring protons. But aldehyde protons are typically at the end, so how could they have neighboring protons? Maybe it's a formyl group attached to a CH2 or something. Like RCH2CHO? No, wait, that would make the aldehyde a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond, like an enal. So the structure might be something like CH2=CH-CHO... but I'm not sure yet.

The next peak is 6.98 ppm, a doublet (d, 2H). That's typical for aromatic protons. The doublet suggests each of these two protons is next to one other proton in the aromatic ring. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring, but wait, a para substitution would give a singlet for each equivalent proton. Alternatively
