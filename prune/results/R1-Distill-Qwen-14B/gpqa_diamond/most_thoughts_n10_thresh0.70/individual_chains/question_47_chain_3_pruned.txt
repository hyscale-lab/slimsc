Okay, so I've got this question about identifying a compound based on its spectral data. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of what functional groups might be present. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So, (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. That’s 5 degrees. So that could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3, since benzene is three double bonds or a ring plus three double bonds) plus maybe an ester or amide group, something like that.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. Amides have N-H stretches in that region, which are usually broad. O-H in carboxylic acids are also broad, but maybe in this case, since the intensity is medium to strong, maybe it's an amide or something else with N-H. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. That could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Since the molecule has O2, maybe ester or amide.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, maybe an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so like an ethyl group attached to something else, maybe an oxygen.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet might be an NH2 group, but wait, the IR suggested N-H. But if the integration is 2H, maybe it's a NH group or maybe some kind of OCH2... Hmm.

Wait, the singlet suggests no neighboring Hs. So maybe it's an NH2 group, but that would typically be a broad peak, but usually a singlet would mean no adjacent H's. Alternatively, an OCH2 group where the two Hs are deshielded but not split. Or perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative group but with symmetry.

Wait, another thought: if it's an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet for the CH2 near the oxygen and a triplet for the CH3. But in the NMR, the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, so that could be the CH3 of an ethyl group. Let's see, the next peak is 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Maybe this is an OCH2 group, but why is it a singlet? Or perhaps it's an NH group, but if it's a singlet, maybe it's a secondary amine. Wait, the formula has one N, so perhaps an amide.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzene with an ethoxy group at position 3 and a benzamide group (CONH2) at position... Wait, no, benzamide is a benzene ring with a CONH2 group. So the substituents would be ethoxy and CONH2.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONR2. So this would be OHC-N attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 at para position, and the formamide would be OHC-N-Ph-OCH2CH3.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Which would be a benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) at para (position 4), and a propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? Or maybe it's a CH2CH2COO- as the ester. Hmm, need to think about that.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So structure is benzoate ester: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) and an NH2 at position 4.

So, the NMR shows:

- 1.20 (t, 3H) → likely CH2CH3. So an ethyl group somewhere.

- 4.0 (bs, 2H) → maybe OCH2?

Wait, in an ethyl ester, the O
