Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). And the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, first, I need to understand what this Lagrangian represents. Oh right, in particle interactions, the Lagrangian tells us how particles interact. So here, the boson X is interacting with fermions. The term (υ + X(y)) suggests that this is part of Yukawa coupling, which is a type of interaction between fermions and bosons, like in the Higgs mechanism.

The general form of a Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ̄ ϕ ψ, where ϕ is a scalar (the boson here, X) and ψ is a fermion field. So in this case, the interaction term would lead to processes where the boson X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair.

So the possible decay channels of X would depend on which fermions it couples to. The problem is giving me the interaction, so I can figure out which fermions are involved.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it's written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the index f here probably stands for the fermion flavor. So for each fermion species f, there's an interaction term. So the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion has mass m_f less than or equal to half the mass of X, because in decay processes, the energy available must be at least twice the mass of the decay products (since energy and momentum must be conserved; each product must have at least their rest mass energy).

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Each fermion has a mass, so for a pair, each fermion's mass is m, so the pair's total rest mass is 2m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to list all fermions (quarks and leptons) with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Let me list the known fermion masses:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV (negligible)
- Muon (μ): ~0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos: even lighter, so their masses are negligible.

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV (current quark mass)
- Down (d): ~0.0045 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait. The current quark masses are the masses of the free particles, but in bound states, like in protons, they might have higher effective masses. But for decay purposes, what matters is the rest mass. So when a fermion is produced in a decay, they must have enough energy to create their rest mass.

So the question is, which fermion-antifermion pairs can the X boson decay into, considering their masses.

So the possible fermion pairs are those where each fermion has m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Let's go through each possible fermion:

Electron (e): m=0.0005 GeV → definitely allowed. So e+ e- is a possible decay.

Muon (μ): m=0.1057 GeV → allowed. So μ+ μ- is possible.

Tau (τ): m=1.777 GeV → 1.777 * 2 = 3.554 GeV. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the X has a mass of 6 GeV. So each fermion in the pair must have m ≤ 6/2 =3 GeV. Because, for a pair, you need 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Tau is about 1.777 GeV, which is less than 3, so allowed.

But wait, the tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 2*m_tau is about 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV (the X mass). So tau pair is allowed. So X → τ+ τ- is possible.

What about the other quarks:

Up quark: m ~ 0.003 GeV → allowed.

Down quark: ~0.0045 GeV → allowed.

Strange quark: ~0.095 GeV → allowed.

Charm quark: m ~1.5 GeV → 2*1.5 = 3 GeV, which is exactly m_X/2. So allowed.

Bottom quark: m ~4.5 GeV → 2m_b =9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Top quark: way too heavy, so no.

So the possible fermions are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the charged leptons versus the neutrinos? In the interaction term, does the fermion include neutrinos? The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which typically includes both particles and antiparticles. But in this case, the term is ψ̄_f (y) X ψ_f(y), suggesting that X can couple to each fermion species f. So for leptons, it could be e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

But for neutrinos, their masses are negligible, so they might not be considered here. However, in the Standard Model, the Yukawa coupling for neutrinos is usually very small, so maybe the interaction is negligible. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that the X can decay into any of the available fermions.

Wait, but the problem states "the interaction is given by" that Lagrangian. So the fermions that are present in the Lagrangian are the ones that X can decay into. So if in the Lagrangian, the interaction term is with ψ_f, which includes all possible fermions, then X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass is allowed.

So, in the decay, what pairs are possible?

Let me list all possible fermion-antifermion pairs that satisfy m_f ≤ 3 GeV:

Leptons:
- e+ e-
- μ+ μ-
- τ+ τ-

Quarks:
- u ubar
- d dbar
- s sbar
- c cbar

So, possible decay channels are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ubar, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar.

Looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the bottom quark has m=4.5 GeV, so 2m is 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A is incorrect because it includes b bbar.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

So this includes all the possible fermions except for the b quark. So this seems correct.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, t tbar would require 2*173 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV. So that's impossible. So option C is wrong.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Again, including b bbar, which is impossible. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is option B, which includes all the allowed fermion pairs except for the bottom quark and top quark, and neutrinos (but neutrinos have negligible mass, and the problem doesn't list them as options, so perhaps they're not considered here).

Wait, but another thought: in the Standard Model, the charged leptons (e, μ, τ) have mass terms, but are the neutrinos included in the interaction? The given Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). So for each fermion f, whether lepton or quark, there's an interaction. So the X can decay into any of the charged lepton pairs, as well as quark pairs.

But wait, in the problem statement, the options include only charged leptons and quarks, not neutrinos. So the possible decays are into charged lepton pairs and quark pairs where the mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the correct allowed decays are:

Charged leptons: e, μ, τ.

Quarks: u, d, s, c.

So the options should include all of these pairs.

Looking back at the options:

Option B lists c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-. So that's all the allowed ones. Therefore, option B is correct.


The interaction between the bosonic field \( X \) and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

where \( X \) is a boson with a mass of 6 GeV. The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) depend on the fermion masses, as the total rest mass of the decay products must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition becomes \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Neutrinos: Their masses are negligible, so they are not considered here.

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.0045 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

Thus, the allowed decay channels of \( X \) are into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
\[
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u\bar{u}, \, d\bar{d}, \, s\bar{s}, \, c\bar{c}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists all allowed decays (\( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\e^- \)) and excludes \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
