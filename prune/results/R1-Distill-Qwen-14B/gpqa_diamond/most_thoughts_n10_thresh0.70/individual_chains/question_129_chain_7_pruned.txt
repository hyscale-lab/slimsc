Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can get tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's see what each step does and what information we have.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. So, A to B is an addition of HCN. I remember that HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups, maybe forming a cyanohydrin. So maybe A is a ketone or aldehyde.

2. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. H2 and Pd are hydrogenation catalysts, so perhaps a double bond is being hydrogenated. If B is a ketone with an adjacent nitrile or something, maybe the reduction affects that.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. HCN adds to a carbonyl, so A must be a ketone or aldehyde. Let's say A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Then B would be a cyanohydrinâ€”so a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Then, when B is hydrogenated (H2, Pd), maybe the nitrile group (CN) is reduced. Nitriles reduce to amines with LiAlH4 or other strong reducing agents, but H2 and Pd might not reduce nitriles. Wait, I'm a bit confused. What's the typical outcome of H2 and Pd on nitriles? Oh wait, I think under hydrogenation, nitriles can be reduced to amines, but maybe with a different catalyst. Or perhaps the double bond in B is hydrogenated.

Wait, maybe B has a double bond. Let me think: if A is a cyclic ketone, then adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which would have an -OH and -CN group. But that doesn't necessarily create a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Could A be an aldehyde instead? Then HCN addition would form a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group adjacent.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a cyclic ketone, and when HCN is added, it forms a five-membered ring with a new oxygen and nitrile group.

Wait, maybe I should look at the hints. The hints might shed some light.

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, phosphorous ylide reactions are typically for Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So, if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, the ylide must have a propan-2-ylidene group (like a methylene group attached to a propyl group). Wait, no: the product has a propan-2-ylidene substituent. So the ylide would have a CH2-C(CH3)2 group perhaps.

Wait, the structure is 4-(propan-2-
