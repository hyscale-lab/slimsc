Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The compound is an organic one, and based on the options, it's either a propenyl or butenyl acetate, and whether it's cis or trans.

The NMR data given is: 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d). Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that acetates typically have an ester group. The structure is usually OAc-O-CR2, where R can vary. So for propenyl acetate, the propenyl group is CH2CHCH2 or maybe CH2=CHCH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but then as an ester, it's acetate, so the structure would be something like CH3COO-CH2CHCH2? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, propenyl as an ester would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, that's propanol. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be O-acetyl connected to the propenyl group.

But wait, the question is about cis or trans. So these compounds are either E or Z. For example, propenyl acetate would have a double bond, and the substituents (like the ester group and the other part) can be cis or trans.

Looking at the NMR, the peaks are key. So the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a big coupling constant, which suggests a trans coupling. Because in a trans double bond, the coupling between the two protons would be larger. Wait, wait, in allylic systems, the coupling can be around 10-18 Hz. A doublet at 7 ppm might be a proton that's coupled to another through a double bond. So let's think about the structure.

In propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait
