Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of steps. I need to determine which option correctly outlines the synthesis pathway.

First, I should probably sketch out the target molecule. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me number the benzene ring positions. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement, I think. Wait, no, let me visualize the benzene ring with three substituents.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let's number the positions:

1: ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)
2: tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)
3: nitro group (-NO2)

So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. That makes them adjacent in a meta arrangement? No, wait: Position 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a way that 1 is next to 2 and 3, and 2 is next to 3. Hmm, maybe it's more like a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which is a meta arrangement for the substituents. Or perhaps it's a particular order in the numbering.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the substituents are arranged. Let me imagine the benzene ring: substituents at 1, 2, and 3. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent. So they're all in a row, making a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But that might not be possible because benzene is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta arrangement where the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5, but no, the question says 1, 2, 3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the structure. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So positions 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are on carbons 1, 2, and 3. So the ring is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So, when you look at the ring, the ethoxy is at position 1, and the substituents at 2 and 3 are next to it. Hmm.

Now, I need to figure out the order of reactions to introduce these substituents. Benzene is the starting material. So the reactions involve electrophilic substitution reactions, likely.

Let me think about the directing effects of each substituent. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para directing group). The tert-butyl group is a strong activating, alkyl group (ortho/para). Nitro is a deactivating, meta directing group.

But wait, nitro groups are meta directors. So the order in which these groups are introduced affects where the next group will attach.

So the plan is to introduce substituents in such a way that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. Let me see how to introduce them.

Optionally, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last because it's a deactivating group. If you introduce activating groups first, you can better control where the deactivating group goes.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So perhaps it's best to introduce it after the activating groups, so that the directing effects are in place.

Alternatively, maybe not. Let me think. The order of substitution matters because each new group will direct the next substitution.

Let me outline possible steps.

Option 1: Introduce tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But wait, benzene first is attacked by an electrophile. Let me think about the first substitution.

Optionally, the first substituent is the tert-butyl group. Using AlCl3 as a catalyst, benzene reacts with tert-butyl chloride. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.

Then, the next substituent could be ethoxy. But wait, how would that be introduced? Because ethoxy is usually introduced via an etherification reaction, such as using a Williamson-type synthesis, but that's typically for alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's generally tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using an alkyl halide and AlCl3, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: Friedel-Crafts alkylation for ethoxy? No, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, which introduces alkyl groups. But ethoxy is an ether group, so perhaps it's introduced via an SN2 reaction on a benzene ring with a good leaving group, but that's not common without activating groups.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups to make the ring reactive enough. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an etherification after the ring has activating groups.

Wait, let's think again. Let me outline the possible order of substituents:

One approach is to introduce the groups in the correct positions considering their directing effects.

The target has substituents at positions 1,2,3. So perhaps I should arrange them so that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last, since it's a meta director, which might help in positioning.

Wait, but let's outline the possible steps.

Let me think about the desired substituents in order:

I think the order of addition is important. Let's say the first substituent is the tert-butyl. Then, the next substituent is the ethoxy. Then, the nitro group is added. Or perhaps another order.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, so when adding it, it would go into the positions relative to the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. But nitro is a strong deactivating group, which would deactivate the ring, making subsequent substitutions difficult. So probably, it's better to add the activating groups first.

So let's consider adding tert-butyl and ethoxy first, then adding the nitro group.

But wait, another thing: The nitro group is a meta director, so if I add it after, it will direct the next substitution, but if I have already added other substituents, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via an nitration reaction, which is an electrophilic substitution. So, if we have an activating group, the nitration can occur at the activated positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence should be: introduce nitro first, then the activating groups. But as I said, nitro is deactivating, which makes subsequent substitutions difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, such as a substitution reaction after something else. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group can be introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylating to give arylalkyl ethers? Or is that done via a different method?

Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically introduces an alkyl group, but for introducing an ether group, maybe we can use a two-step process: first, introduce a halogen (like Cl) via electrophilic substitution, then perform a nucleophilic substitution with an alcohol (like using NaOH and ethyl bromide, but that's for elimination... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually difficult unless the ring is activated.

Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group approach. Let me think: If I first have the tert-butyl group on benzene, which is strongly activating (ortho/para), then I could introduce the ethoxy group in the para position relative to the tert-butyl. Then, after that, introduce the nitro group in the meta position relative to one of the substituents.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each possible option.

Looking at the options, each starts with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. So the first step in all options seems to be introducing the tert-butyl group.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; then HNO3/H2SO4 (ii), then SO3/H2SO4 (iii), etc. Wait, but I need to think about the steps.

Wait, let me think about what each reagent does. HNO3 with H2SO4 is nitrating mixture, which introduces a nitro group. Fe/HCl is usually a catalyst for some reactions; I think it might be used for the nitration, but wait, no, the nitration is done with HNO3 and H2SO4, while Fe/HCl is used for something else, perhaps the diazotization step.

Wait, another common reagent combination: H2SO4 and HNO3 is for nitration. Fe and HCl is for making FeCl3, but perhaps for a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the nitration is done with a nitrating mixture, which is H2SO4 and HNO3. Then, the Fe/HCl might be for a subsequent step, perhaps hydrolysis or another substitution.

Wait, but let's think about the steps involved in the target molecule.

The target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So, perhaps the steps involve introducing each substituent in the correct order.

Another approach: Let's think about the order of the substituents.

Since the nitro group is a deactivating meta director, perhaps it's introduced last, after the activating groups are in place.

But wait, the ethoxy group is also an activating group, so perhaps adding it before the nitro group would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via alkylation after the nitro is in place. But no, because the nitro is deactivating, it would be harder to add another substituent.

So, perhaps the best approach is to add the activating groups first, then the deactivating group.

So the order would be: tert-butyl (activating), then ethoxy (activating), then nitro (deactivating).

But wait, the tert-butyl and ethoxy are both activating, so adding them first would allow the next substitution (nitration) to occur in the correct position.

Wait, but the nitro group is introduced via electrophilic substitution, which requires the ring to be activated. Once the nitro is added, the ring becomes deactivating, making further substitutions difficult, but in our case, all substituents are already added, so that's not an issue.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro group is at position 3. So perhaps after adding tert-butyl and ethoxy, the nitro group is added in the meta position relative to one of them.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce tert-butyl (using AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride) → benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

2. Introduce ethoxy group. How? Since the ring is already activated by tert-butyl, perhaps Friedel-Crafts alkylation can't be used for ethoxy because ethoxy is an ether. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylating to produce arylalkanes, but ethoxy is an ether, so perhaps that's done via a different method, like a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but benzene isn't very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. So perhaps I need to activate the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a SN2-type reaction on a benzene ring with a good leaving group. But that's tricky. Alternatively, maybe using a directing group approach.

Wait, another approach: The ethoxy group can be introduced via a substitution after the ring has been nitrated. But nitro is a deactivator, so perhaps it's better to introduce it after the activating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires strong activating groups. So if I have a nitro group and a tert-butyl group, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a two-step process, such as first introducing a nitro group, then substituting it with ethoxy. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option step by step.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

But wait, introducing nitro first would deactive the ring, making further substitution difficult. So after nitration, adding tert-butyl via AlCl3 might not be feasible because the ring is deactivating. So option D's first step is nitration, which might not be the best approach.

So let me evaluate each option.

Option A:

Steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → introduce tert-butyl group on benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → where would the nitro group go? Since tert-butyl is an activating group (ortho/para), the nitration would occur at ortho or para to the tert-butyl group.

But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). Hmm, perhaps the nitration occurs at position 3.

Wait, but let me visualize: tert-butyl is at position 2. So the ring has a substituent at 2. The nitration would occur at either ortho (position 1 or 3) or para (position 6), relative to the tert-butyl.

Hmm, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So the nitration must occur at position 3 (meta to the ethoxy?), but wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about when the ethoxy is introduced.

Looking at option A's steps: after nitration, step iii is SO3/H2SO4. What's that reagent? That's sulfonation, which introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). So that's adding another substituent. But in the target, we don't have a sulfonic acid group. So option A may not be correct.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → nitro group at ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Then iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps a catalyst for something else, like a diazotization step, but after nitration, what comes next? Maybe a substitution.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? That doesn't make sense because the target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, option B seems to have another nitration step. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Wait, let me recheck option B. The steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) nitration → introduces nitro group.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps for a reduction or for making a diazonium salt. Oh, wait, maybe it's for a subsequent nitration? No, after nitration, HNO3 again doesn't make sense.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. So now, the ring has tert-butyl and sulfonic acid groups.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

But as I thought earlier, introducing nitro first makes the ring deactivating, making subsequent electrophilic substitutions difficult. So next step is iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → but with a deactivating group, would the AlCl3 even activate the ring enough for Friedel-Crafts? I think Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group, so if the ring is deactivated by nitro, perhaps the AlCl3 won't help. So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Hmm, so the only option that makes sense is option A or B or C.

Wait, let me reconsider option A. After introducing tert-butyl, the second step is nitration, which would add nitro in ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let me imagine the structure after nitration: tert-butyl at position 2, nitro at position 3 (assuming it's ortho to tert-butyl).

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So that's correct.

Then, step iii in option A is SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, which would add a sulfonic acid group somewhere. But the target doesn't have that. So step iii would add another substituent, which is not present in the target. So option A is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again about the steps.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing ethoxy in a later step, not via direct substitution but via some other method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been nitrated, but that's challenging because the ring is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a different route, such as a hydroxyl group being present and then being converted to ethoxy.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the nitro group is introduced via a nitration after the ethoxy group is in place. Let me think.

If I first introduce tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but the problem is how to introduce the ethoxy group. Friedel-Crafts alkylation generally adds alkyl groups, not ethers. So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a good leaving group.

Wait, but benzene doesn't have a good leaving group. So perhaps the steps involve adding a nitro group first, then making a leaving group, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been sulfonated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a two-step process: first, introduce a nitro group, then reduce it to an amine, then convert to a leaving group, but that's a bit involved.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first introduce tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has been activated by the tert-butyl group.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl bromide, but that would introduce an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an etherification after introducing a nitro group, but that seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce tert-butyl group → using AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride.

2. Introduce ethoxy group → but how? Maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the ring is activated by the tert-butyl group, and a good leaving group is present. For example, if we had a nitro group at a position, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the tert-butyl group is in place, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a SN2 reaction on a benzyl chloride, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps for another reaction, but I'm not sure.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → trying to alkylate nitrobenzene, which is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts would not work.

Hmm, no, that's probably not feasible.

So perhaps the correct option is not D.

Looking again at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) nitration → nitro group at ortho or para to tert-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe for a substitution reaction, like turning a nitro group into an amine, but that's via reduction. Hmm, Fe/HCl is often used for making HCl and FeCl3, but I'm not sure.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? That would add another nitro group, but target has only one. So option B's step iv seems incorrect.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation → adds a sulfonic acid group.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

But target doesn't have sulfonic acid, so option C is incorrect.

So perhaps the only option left is option A, but I'm not sure about the steps.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) nitration → adds nitro group.

iii) SO3 → sulfonation → adds another substituent.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O, Heat → hydrolysis? Maybe a substitution.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 reaction, like Williamson ether synthesis.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation again.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

Hmm, but the target doesn't have sulfonic acid groups, so steps iii and viii in option A add sulfonic acid. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. So all three substituents are present. So any option that adds more substituents than that is incorrect.

So perhaps I need to look for an option that after introducing the three substituents, doesn't add any more.

Looking at option D again:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine? Fe and HCl in presence of benzene rings: perhaps for a substitution, but I'm not sure.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → trying to alkylate nitrobenzene. Since nitro is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So perhaps this step fails, making option D incorrect.

Hmm, maybe the correct sequence is:

tert-butyl first, then ethoxy via some method, then nitro.

But the question is, how to introduce ethoxy. Another approach: Maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a coupling reaction or via a substitution after a nitro group is introduced.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires strong activating groups, like amino groups. So perhaps you first nitrate, then reduce the nitro to an amine, then substitute the amine with ethoxy.

Wait, let's think about that.

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduction of nitro group to amine → aniline.

3. Then, substitute the amine with ethoxy group. But amine is a strong activating group, so perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic substitution. For example, using an alkyl halide with a good leaving group, in the presence of a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using an ethyl bromide in basic conditions, but I'm not sure.

But that's getting complicated. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a nitro group is present. For example, if the nitro group is at position 3, then the ethoxy could be introduced at position 1 via some substitution. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's only for alkyl groups, not ethers.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an etherification after a nitro group is in place, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a step involving a nitro group being converted to a nitroso group, then to an amine, then to a leaving group. But that's a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution where the nitro group is converted into a better leaving group. For example, if the nitro group is reduced to an amine, which is then treated with a chlorinating agent to introduce a chlorine, which can then be substituted with ethoxy.

But that involves multiple steps, and I'm not sure if any of the options include such steps.

Hmm, maybe it's better to approach this by considering the order of substituents.

The target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the order in which these are introduced would determine their positions.

Let me imagine the benzene ring and the substituents:

- Position 1: ethoxy
- Position 2: tert-butyl
- Position 3: nitro

So, the substituents are arranged such that each is at a specific position relative to the others.

Perhaps the first substituent is the tert-butyl group at position 2. Then, the ethoxy is introduced at position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl), and the nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl).

But how would that happen?

Let me think about the steps again.

1. Introduce tert-butyl group (activating, para/ortho director).

2. Introduce ethoxy group (activating, para/ortho director) in such a way that it's in the correct position relative to the tert-butyl.

3. Then, introduce nitro group (deactivating, meta director) in the correct position.

But the order of steps matters. Let me outline a possible sequence:

a. Introduce tert-butyl group → para and ortho positions are activated.

b. Introduce ethoxy group → perhaps in the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl (position 3?), but wait, the target has ethoxy at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced para to the tert-butyl, but then the nitro group would have to be introduced meta to the ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy, which would direct it to a meta position relative to the ethoxy.

Wait, let me think in terms of the steps in the options.

Looking again at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration → nitro group added ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Assuming it's added at position 3 (ortho), then the nitro is at 3, tert-butyl at 2.

But where is the ethoxy? It must be at position 1. So perhaps the next step is to introduce ethoxy.

But how? Option B's step iii is Fe/HCl. Hmm, perhaps that's for a substitution reaction. But I'm not sure how that would introduce ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, another substituent is added.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. For that, the ring would need a good leaving group. So perhaps the nitro group at position 3 is converted into a nitroso, then to a hydroxylamine, then to a hydroxyl group, which can then be substituted with ethoxy. But that's a series of steps not outlined in any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is in place, but that's challenging.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of each option's steps in terms of the target.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → possibly reduction of nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride → trying to alkylate, but aniline's ring is activated (since amine is a strong activating group), so perhaps tert-butyl can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation. Aniline is strongly activating, so Friedel-Crafts could introduce a tert-butyl group. So after nitration (step i), you have nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine, giving aniline. Step iii: AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → aniline becomes N-tert-butylaniline? Or perhaps the tert-butyl is introduced at a specific position.

Wait, but aniline has the amino group, which is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So when we alkylate aniline, the tert-butyl would go into the ortho or para position relative to the amino group (which is at position 1). So the tert-butyl would be at position 2 or 4.

Wait, but in the target, the tert-butyl is at position 2, and the ethoxy is at position 1. Hmm.

Wait, after reducing nitro to amine, we have aniline. Then, alkylation adds tert-butyl at ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to the amino group.

If it's added at position 2, then the structure is NH2 (position 1), tert-butyl (position 2). Then, perhaps the next step is to introduce the ethoxy group, but how?

Wait, after that, step iv in option D is another nitration, which would add another nitro group, which is not desired. So option D's step iv is adding another nitro group, which the target doesn't have. So that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps after introducing tert-butyl, the next step is to introduce the ethoxy. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the amino group is converted into a leaving group. For example, converting the amino group into a nitro group (which is not helpful), or into a halide.

Wait, perhaps the amino group is converted into a good leaving group. For example, using a diazotization reaction: treating aniline with NaNO2 and HCl to form a diazonium salt, which can then be decomposed to form a halide under certain conditions.

So, after alkylation (step iii in option D), we have NH2 at 1 and t-Bu at 2. Then, step iv is HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration, which doesn't fit. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about the steps in option B again.

Option B steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride → benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → nitro at ortho or para to t-Bu.

Assuming nitro at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu at 2).

Then, step iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine.

Then, step iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again, which would add another nitro group, which target doesn't have.

So option B is incorrect because of step iv.

Option A: Let's re-examine.

Option A steps:

i) t-Bu chloride → benzene → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitration → nitro at 3.

iii) SO3 → sulfonation → adds -SO3H at position 4, perhaps.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → but of what? If the ring has nitro and t-Bu, perhaps the amine is formed from nitro reduction.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about each step in option A.

Step iii is SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. So after nitration, the ring has t-Bu (2), nitro (3). Then sulfonation would add a sulfonic acid group, perhaps at position 4 or 5 or 6. But the target doesn't have that, so option A is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is none of the above? But that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the order of the steps.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is introduced. For example, introducing a nitro group, then substituting it with something else, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a coupling reaction after the ring has been activated by other groups.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D:

The steps are:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine (aniline).

iii) AlCl3 and t-Bu chloride → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → would add t-Bu to the ring.

But since the ring is activated by the amine group, the t-Bu would go into ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

So, if amine is at position 1, the t-Bu would be at position 2 or 4.

Then, step iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration → but that would add another nitro group, which we don't want. So option D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to introduce ethoxy via a substitution after the ring has two substituents. But I'm not sure how to achieve that.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution using a directing group. For example, if the ring has a nitro group and a tert-butyl group, perhaps the ethoxy can be introduced in a position activated by both.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution of a nitro group. For example, converting nitro to a good leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been nitrated, but that would require activating the ring, which is difficult.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Alkylation → introduce tert-butyl (Friedel-Crafts on aniline).

4. Introduce ethoxy via substitution of the amino group.

But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the amino group is formed. For example, converting the amino group into a leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy.

But how? Diazonium salt formation perhaps.

Wait, if you have aniline (after nitration and reduction), then form the diazonium salt with NaNO2 and HCl. Then, perhaps decompose the diazonium salt to form a chloride, which can then be substituted with ethoxy via an SN2 reaction.

So, steps could be:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitro.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Alkylation → introduce t-Bu.

iv) Diazotization → form diazonium salt.

v) Hydrolyze diazonium salt → form chloride.

vi) Substitute chloride with ethoxy group using NaOH and ethyl bromide.

But I'm not sure if any of the options include this.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option B's steps are:

i) t-Bu → benzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe to reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → which is not desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, despite the nitration step because the order is different.

Wait, perhaps in option D, after introducing nitro, then tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts, and then ethoxy via another method.

But I'm not seeing it.

Another approach: Let me think about each substituent's position relative to each other.

The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the arrangement is such that each substituent is adjacent to at least one other.

Perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce tert-butyl at position 2.

2. Introduce nitro at position 3 (meta to position 1, which is ethoxy but not present yet).

Wait, no, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But ethoxy is a strong activating group, so nitro would be introduced in the meta position relative to ethoxy.

Wait, let's try that.

1. Introduce ethoxy → benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Introduce tert-butyl → para/ortho to ethoxy.

Assuming tert-butyl is introduced ortho to ethoxy (position 2), then the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2.

3. Then, introduce nitro group → meta to ethoxy (position 3) or meta to tert-butyl (position 4? Or 5? Or 6?).

Wait, if ethoxy is at 1, nitro would be introduced at position 3 (meta to ethoxy), which is adjacent to tert-butyl at 2.

So that would give the substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro), which matches the target.

So the order would be:

- Ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy via electrophilic substitution? Because ethoxy is an ether group, which isn't typically introduced via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a good leaving group. So, perhaps:

1. Introduce a nitro group at position 3 (meta to where ethoxy would be).

Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a leaving group, such as a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

a. Introduce nitro group → nitrobenzene.

b. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

c. Introduce ethoxy via substitution of the amine group.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the amino group is converted into a better leaving group, such as a diazonium salt.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not confident. Let me look at option B's steps:

i) t-Bu chloride → benzene → t-Bu benzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro added, say at position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps converting nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → which would add another nitro, which is not desired.

So option B is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy via a substitution.

But I don't see any option that includes that.

Wait, perhaps option A introduces the SO3 group and others, but that's not helpful.

I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should think about the relative positions of substituents.

In the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

So, looking from the ethoxy group, the nitro is at meta (position 3), and the tert-butyl is at ortho (position 2).

So, if ethoxy is introduced first, the nitro group would be introduced at meta to ethoxy (position 3), and tert-butyl at ortho (position 2) or para (position 6).

But how to introduce ethoxy first? Friedel-Crafts can't introduce ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced as a leaving group after the ring has other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group. For example:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Introduce ethoxy via substitution of the amine group.

But how? If the amine is replaced by ethoxy, that would require something like a coupling reaction or a substitution where amine is a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the amine is converted into a nitro group again, but that's not helpful.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iii) t-Bu chloride/AlCl3 → AlCl3 is a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts; but since the ring is now activated by the amine, t-Bu can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adding at ortho or para to the amine.

So, if amine is at 1, t-Bu could be at 2 or 4.

Then, step iv) HNO3 → another nitration, which would add a nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy via substitution.

But how to introduce ethoxy? Maybe using a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group is present.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a nitroso, then into a hydroxyl group, then into ethoxy. But that involves several steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is converted into a good leaving group, then substituted with ethoxy.

But I'm not seeing any option that includes such steps.

Perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Let me think about the order in which these are introduced based on their directing effects.

- tert-butyl is activating, para/ortho.

- ethoxy is activating, para/ortho.

- nitro is deactivating, meta.

So, the nitro should be introduced last, as it's deactivating and would direct meta.

So, the correct order is:

1. Introduce tert-butyl.

2. Introduce ethoxy.

3. Introduce nitro.

Now, how to introduce ethoxy after tert-butyl.

Perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's difficult unless the ring is highly activated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the tert-butyl is in place, using a directing group.

Wait, perhaps using a benzyne intermediate. But that's a bit advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a coupling reaction, such as using a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a leaving group, like a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

- Introduce tert-butyl.

- Introduce nitro.

- Then, substitute the nitro group with ethoxy.

But nitro is a meta director, so substitution wouldn't occur in the desired position.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should look for an option where the nitro group is introduced last.

Looking back, option A introduces nitro group second, then sulfonates, etc. Option B introduces nitro second, then another nitro. Option C sulfonates first. Option D nitrates first.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-Bu via AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts introduces t-Bu at ortho or para to the amine (position 2 or 4).

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again → adds another nitro group, which is not desired.

So option D is incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not sure. Let me think again about option B.

Option B steps:

i) t-Bu chloride → benzene → t-Bu benzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro at position 3 (ortho to t-Bu).

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → which would add another nitro group.

But target only has one nitro group. So option B is incorrect.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should think about the steps in option A.

Option A steps:

i) t-Bu → benzene → t-Bu benzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 3.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate at 4.

iv) NaNO2 → form diazonium salt.

v) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → perhaps decomposition.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → SN2 substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate again.

ix) dilute H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps step vii is introducing ethoxy via SN2 substitution.

Let me think:

After step iii, the ring has t-Bu (2), nitro (3), and sulfonic acid (4).

Then, in step iv, NaNO2/HCl → perhaps diazotization, but where is the amine?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of each step in order.

Option A:

1. t-Bu chloride → benzene → t-Bu benzene.

2. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro at position 3.

3. SO3 → sulfonate → adds SO3H at position 4.

4. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → but the ring has nitro at 3 and sulfonic acid at 4; where is the amine?

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to amine in a previous step, but I don't see that in option A. So step iv in option A is adding NaNO2/HCl to a ring with nitro and sulfonic acid groups. That seems unclear.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've exhausted my options and perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is added.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is converted to a nitroso group, then to an amine, then to a leaving group, then substituted with ethoxy.

But none of the options seem to include such steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it.

Another thought: The target molecule has three substituents, and the options involve multiple steps. Perhaps the correct sequence is introducing tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy after tert-butyl?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring is sulfonated.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce tert-butyl.

2. Sulfonate to introduce a good leaving group.

3. Substitute sulfonic acid with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group, but that's difficult.

Hmm.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the order of substituents and the options again.

The target has ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy, ortho to t-Bu).

So, perhaps the order is:

- Ethoxy first → directs nitro to meta (position 3).

- Then, introduce t-Bu at ortho to ethoxy (position 2).

But how to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Each substituent must be added in a position that allows the next substituent to be added correctly.

So, ethoxy is introduced first, then nitro (meta to ethoxy), then tert-butyl (ortho to ethoxy).

But how to introduce ethoxy.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the correct option is option D, but I'm not confident.

After all this thinking, I'm going to make a guess and say the answer is option D.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully introduce the substituents in the correct order to achieve the desired positions. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The directing effects of these groups and the reactivity of the benzene ring must be considered.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step i: Introduces the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
   - Step ii: Nitrates the ring, adding the nitro group at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl).
   - Step iii: Sulfonates the ring, introducing a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - This option introduces an extra substituent (sulfonic acid) that is not desired, making it incorrect.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step i: Introduces the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
   - Step ii: Nitrates the ring, adding the nitro group at position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl).
   - Step iii: Uses Fe/HCl, likely to reduce the nitro group to an amine.
   - Step iv: Nitrates the ring again, adding another nitro group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - This option introduces an additional nitro group, making it incorrect.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step i: Introduces the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
   - Step ii: Sulfonates the ring, introducing a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - Step iii: Nitrates the ring, adding the nitro group.
   - This option introduces an extra substituent (sulfonic acid) that is not desired, making it incorrect.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step i: Nitrates benzene, introducing the nitro group.
   - Step ii: Uses Fe/HCl to reduce the nitro group to an amine.
   - Step iii: Introduces the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which would occur at the ortho or para position relative to the amine.
   - Step iv: Nitrates the ring again, adding another nitro group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - This option introduces an additional nitro group, making it incorrect.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences provided correctly achieve the target molecule without introducing unwanted substituents or additional nitro groups. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** was considered the most plausible due to its sequence of nitration, reduction, and alkylation steps, even though it ultimately introduces an extra nitro group.
