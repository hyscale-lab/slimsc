Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, let me think.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit unusual. So, this is a two-dimensional metric because it only has dx and dy terms, right? But the question is about a pseudosphere, which I remember is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry. Oh wait, pseudosphere is like a tractricoid, which is the surface of constant negative curvature.

Wait, but the metric here doesn't look like the standard metric for a pseudosphere. Let me recall. The standard metric for a pseudosphere (tractricoid) in polar coordinates usually has terms like dr² and r² dθ², but this one is in Cartesian coordinates. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe this is a conformally flat metric because it's written as a function multiplying (dx² + dy²), which is like a conformal factor.

Conformal metrics have the form ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is some function of x and y. In this case, E is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So, the metric is conformally flat, which would make sense for a surface that can be embedded in Euclidean space, but wait, pseudospheres are usually embedded in 3D. Hmm, maybe this is a different approach.

Wait, I'm supposed to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh! Right, the area of a pseudosphere with radius r is
