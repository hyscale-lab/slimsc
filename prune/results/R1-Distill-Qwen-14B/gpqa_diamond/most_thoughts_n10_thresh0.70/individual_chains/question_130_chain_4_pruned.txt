Okay, I have this question about astronomy, specifically about redshift and detecting objects with neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs certain wavelengths, like the Lyman alpha line. The Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which I think is in the ultraviolet range.

Wait, but the question is about optical ground-based telescopes. Oh right, optical telescopes observe visible light, which is longer wavelength than UV. So if the Lyman alpha absorption is in the UV, and the ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere blocks it, how can they detect it?

Ah, right! When the quasar's light is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe, the wavelength of the Lyman alpha line stretches. So if the cloud is at a high enough redshift, the 1216 Angstrom line might shift into the visible spectrum, which optical telescopes can see.

So the key is to find the minimum redshift where this happens. Let me think about the formula. The observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

We want the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. The optical range is roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So let's pick the lower end of the optical range, say 400 nm, to find the minimum z. Because if it's at 400 nm, that's the smallest z needed for the absorption to be visible. If the cloud has a higher redshift, the wavelength would be longer, still in optical.

Wait, wait. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. Oh, wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, right? So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. That's in the UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see it unless it's redshifted into the visible.

So let's compute the redshift z when lambda_obs is 400 nm (which is 4000 Angstroms).

Using lambda_obs = (1 + z) * lambda_rest.

So 4000 Angstroms = (1 + z) * 1216 Angstroms.

Solving for z: (4000 / 1216) - 1 = z.

Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 * 3 is 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216 * 3.29 would be... 1216 *3 is 3648, 0.29 *1216 is about 353, so total 3999. So approximately 3.29. So 3.29 - 1 = 2.29. So z is about 2.29.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly that. Let's check the options again. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.29 is close to option C)2.4. But wait, maybe I should think about the maximum redshift where the Lyman alpha is just visible. Because if the object has a higher redshift, it's further away, but the absorption line would be in the optical. Wait, when would the Lyman alpha line just enter the optical? That's when the observed wavelength is 400 nm. So the redshift z would be (400 / 121.6) -1. Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, I think I messed up the units. Let me double-check.

The Lyman alpha rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. The optical range starts at about 400 nm (violet). So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

Wait no, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So the calculation is correct as before.

So z = (4000 / 1216) -1 = let's compute 4000/1216.

Divide 4000 by 1216.

1216 *3 = 3648, as before. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216 = 0.289 approx. So 3.289, so z is approximately 2.289. So about 2.29.
