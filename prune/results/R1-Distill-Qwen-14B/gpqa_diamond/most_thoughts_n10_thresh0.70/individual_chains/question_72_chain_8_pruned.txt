Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The starting compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I think bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane. So the structure is a norbornene with two double bonds at 2 and 5 positions. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So the structure is like norbornene with an oxygen attached to a tert-butyl group.

Next, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Wait, sodium iodide and dibromidesâ€”maybe some kind of elimination or substitution reaction? Oh, wait, dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. I think this might be a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a diene, the norbornene. The other reactant is a dienophile? Or maybe the other way around. No, wait, the diene is the conjugated diene, which would be the bicyclo compound. The other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups attached to a cyclohexadiene. Hmm, cyclohexa-1,3-diene has conjugated double bonds. So perhaps each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group.

So when the diene (norbornene) reacts with the dienophile, which would be the cyclohexadiene with substituents. But wait, in Diels-Alder, the diene and dienophile combine. So in this case, maybe the dienophile is the cyclohexa-1,3-diene part, and the substituents are the dibromomethyl groups. Or wait, perhaps each of those substituents is a leaving group, so maybe it's not a Diels-Alder but a substitution.

Wait, but the reactant has two equivalents of that cyclohexa-diene. Maybe it's a diels-alder reaction where the norbornene is the dienophile? Or perhaps the norbornene is the diene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an alkyne addition, but more likely Diels-Alder. Let me think: norbornene is a cyclic diene. The other compound has two substituents that might be leaving groups.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. The norbornene has an oxygen with a tert-butyl group. Maybe the tert-butoxy group is acting as a leaving group? No, tert-butoxy is a poor leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the sodium iodide is causing some substitution.

Wait, another approach: the starting material has a bicyclo structure with an ether substituent. When combined with a dienophile and a base, perhaps a Diels-Alder occurs, adding two rings?

Wait, the other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group attached.
