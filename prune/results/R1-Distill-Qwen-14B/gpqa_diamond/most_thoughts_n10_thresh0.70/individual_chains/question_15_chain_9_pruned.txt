Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, Planet 1 or Planet 2. I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit.

Wait, right, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. But how do we calculate the probability?

I think the formula for the probability of a transit is roughly (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another thought: I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2. Or is it (R_p / R_star) times something else?

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a) squared, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I recall that the geometric probability is given by (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly (R_star / a)^2.

Wait, actually, the geometric probability P is given by the formula P = (R_star / a)Â². But wait, no, I think that's the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth
