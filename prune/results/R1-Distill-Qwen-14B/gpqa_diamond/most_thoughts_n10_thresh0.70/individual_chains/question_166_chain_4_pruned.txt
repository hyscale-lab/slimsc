Okay, so I've got this physics question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, I remember that pseudo-Goldstone bosons come into play when there's a spontaneous symmetry breaking, right? Because then you get massless particles from the broken generators, but sometimes they can get a small mass from quantum corrections.

Looking at the Lagrangian given, let me try to parse it. The terms I see are the Dirac term for N_R, a kinetic term for the scalar phi, a covariant derivative term for S, and then some interaction terms. The fields involved are N_iR which are singlets, S which is a scalar doublet, and phi another singlet. 

The potential V(φ, S, H) is probably the important part for mass generation. Wait, the Higgs mechanism. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², with ⟨φ⟩ =x and ⟨h⟩=v. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, phi's VEV is x, and h's VEV is v? Or is h another field here? Wait, the potential includes H, so maybe H is another scalar field? Or maybe in this model, the H is part of the scalar sector. Hmm.

The question is about the mass of H2, which is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. In the Standard Model, the Higgs is the Goldstone boson that gets a mass (the Higgs mechanism). But when you have multiple Higgs fields, you can get multiple Goldstone bosons, some of which might become massive due to various interactions.

Pseudo-Goldstone bosons, like the axions, come from when a symmetry is broken but not completely, maybe an approximate symmetry. But in this case, since it's an extension of the Standard Model, the pseudo-Goldstone is probably related to the breaking of some global symmetry.

Wait, the model has singlet fermions NR. Their presence might affect the masses through loops. The scalar S is a doublet, so it's likely similar to the Standard Model Higgs, but maybe the phi is another scalar. The
