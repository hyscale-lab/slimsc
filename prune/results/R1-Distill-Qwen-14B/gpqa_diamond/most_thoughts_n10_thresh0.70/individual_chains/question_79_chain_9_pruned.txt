Okay, so I've got this problem about an organic chemistry reaction and identifying a compound based on NMR data. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what X is from the options. 

Wait, what's that reaction? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane sounds familiar. Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Hofmann elimination reaction. Hofmann elimination typically involves treating amines with this reagent to eliminate an amine and form an epoxide. Oh wait, no, Hofmann is more about breaking amines into alcohols or something? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with another reaction.

Wait, no, Hofmann elimination is when a quaternary ammonium salt is treated with a strong base like this, leading to elimination to form an alkene. Oh, but in this case, the product's NMR shows some specific signals, so maybe the reaction forms an epoxide.

Wait, alternative thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as a crown ether, but more importantly, it's a base used in elimination reactions. So if X is an epoxide, reacting with this base might cause ring-opening, but that doesn't seem to fit because the product's NMR is the result after reaction. Hmm, maybe X is an epoxide, and the reaction with the base is something else? Or perhaps X is a different compound that reacts to form an epoxide.

Wait, the product's NMR has signals that might indicate an epoxide. Let me look at the 1H NMR data. The signals are: Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.
