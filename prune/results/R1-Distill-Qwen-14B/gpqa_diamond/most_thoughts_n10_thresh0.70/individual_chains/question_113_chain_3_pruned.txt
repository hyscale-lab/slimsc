Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy stuff. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in that region are usually from alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the problem says it's a very broad peak. Carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because they're usually more acidic and can form strong hydrogen bonds. But alcohol O-H is also broad, but maybe less so. Hmm, not sure yet. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for carbonyl groups. So maybe a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl group, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic C=C stretch. Wait, no, the aromatic C=C is usually around 1600. Alternatively, maybe an ester group. Ester carbonyls are around 1740-1700, but conjugation can lower that. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone in an aromatic ring?

Wait, but the 1700 and 1650 could be two different carbonyl groups. But that seems less likely because having two carbonyls in such a small molecule might be a stretch. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (maybe a substituted benzene) with some conjugation. Like maybe an aromatic ring with substituents that lower the wavenumber. Or perhaps an unsaturated system like an alkene. Wait, wait, the 1H NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are on a double bond, so that's an alkene. So there's an alkene in the molecule.

So combining all this, the molecule has an O-H group (the broad peak), a carbonyl group (170
