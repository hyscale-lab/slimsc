Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, forms a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is similar.

Hmm, I remember that in some reactions, metals like sodium or potassium react violently with water or other liquids. Let me think about that. For example, potassium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas, which is gas W here.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hydrogen's molecular form is H2. Each hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't match. Oh wait, maybe it's another gas. What else? Helium? No, because He is a noble gas and doesn't have a reaction like this. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility is that W is ammonia (NH3), but that doesn't fit. Or maybe CO2? No, wait. Let me think about the neutron and proton counts. The molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in each atom, but wait,
