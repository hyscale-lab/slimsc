Okay, so I have this question about a biology experiment and which method won't help determine the mitochondrial role of a new drug. Hmm, let's break this down.

The question is about a drug's effect on mitochondria. The setup involves experiments on HEK293 cells, and I have four options to consider. I need to figure out which experiment isn't useful for discovering the mitochondrial role.

First, let me understand each option:

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria followed by a glucose uptake assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is used to isolate organelles. If you extract mitochondria, then you can test their function. The glucose assay measures glucose uptake, which relates to insulin function. But wait, if the mitochondria are extracted, how does glucose uptake happen? Because glucose is taken up by the cell, not the mitochondria. So maybe this assay isn't the right approach if the drug affects mitochondrial function directly. Alternatively, if the drug affects the cell's ability to take up glucose, maybe the assay would show that, but that doesn't directly relate to mitochondria. So maybe this option is not helpful for mitochondrial function.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. Wait, luciferase is an enzyme used in bioluminescence assays. If the cells are transformed with luciferase, perhaps it's a reporter gene. But wait, luciferase is commonly used for measuring cellular ATP levels because the reaction requires ATP. Adding luciferin would cause the cells to emit light proportional to ATP levels. So if the drug affects mitochondrial ATP
