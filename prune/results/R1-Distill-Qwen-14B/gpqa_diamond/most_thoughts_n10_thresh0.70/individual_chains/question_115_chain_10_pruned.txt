Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the setup is that an electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One is moving up-right, the other down-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, so first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Because electron and positron have equal and opposite charges, so when they annihilate, the total momentum and energy must be conserved.

Let me think about the conservation laws here. Since they're annihilating into two photons, both energy and momentum must be conserved.

The electron has a Lorentz factor gamma_e =4. The positron has gamma_p=2. But wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction, right? So their velocities are in opposite directions.

But wait, the Lorentz factor depends on the speed, so each has their own gamma. But for momentum, I think the relativistic momentum is gamma * m * v. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait, the electron has charge -e, the positron +e. So when they annihilate, the total energy is the sum of their rest mass plus kinetic, but because they have Lorentz factors, their energies are higher.

Wait, but the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, but I'm not sure if the actual numbers matter here. Since the problem says both photons have the same energy, so each photon has energy E_photon = (gamma_e * m_e c^2 + gamma_p * m_e c^2) / 2? Or wait, no, because the positron's gamma is 2, but the direction matters for momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of four-vectors. The total four-momentum before annihilation is the sum of the electron's and positron's four-momenta.

The four-momentum of each particle is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). Since they
