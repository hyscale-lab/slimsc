Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about identifying an organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are various propenyl and butenyl acetates in cis and trans configurations.

First, I'll try to parse the NMR data provided. The chemical shifts are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). 

Hmm, acetates typically have an ester group, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, more accurately, it's an ester where an acyl group is attached to an oxygen, which is connected to an alkyl group. So, the general formula is RCOOR', where R is the acyl part and R' is the alkyl.

Looking at the integration, there's a triplet (3H, d) and a singlet (3H, s). The singlet is probably a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So that's likely the acetate's methyl, as in OAc (the O connected to CH3). So the 2.1 ppm peak is probably the OAc methyl, which is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet because it's not split much.

The other 3H as a doublet at 1.6 ppm. That could be a methyl group adjacent to something else, maybe a CH2 or a double bond. Since it's a doublet, perhaps it's attached to a CH that's next to another group.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe it's a doublet with some coupling. Wait, the description says 'dq'â€”maybe it's a doublet of quartets, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet with some additional splitting. I'm not entirely certain about the notation, but let's think about the structure.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling, so it's probably between two protons that are trans to each other, maybe on a double bond. For example, in an E (trans) configuration, the coupling between the two vinyl protons would be around 16 Hz. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in a trans double bond, the coupling between the two protons on adjacent carbons is usually around 12-18 Hz, but cis would be lower? Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think: for a trans double bond, the dihedral angle is 180 degrees, so the coupling is larger. So J=16 Hz would suggest a trans coupling.

Wait, but in the case of a trans double bond, the two protons are on opposite sides, so their coupling would be larger. So the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16. That suggests a proton that's coupled to another proton trans to it, so perhaps in a trans configuration.

Wait, but the
