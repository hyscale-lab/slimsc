Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step. I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime affects how far they travel before decaying, which in turn affects what we can observe in detectors like bubble chambers.

The problem states that X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The goal is to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The setup is in the CERN Bubble Chamber with an energy of 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving at high speeds, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the bubble chamber) will be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, that's gamma times tau_0. And gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the particle's velocity.

The formula for gamma is gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. The total energy E of the particle is given, so E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, since we're using units where c is in natural units, perhaps we can ignore c for the calculation. Because in particle physics, energies and masses are often expressed in GeV and GeV/c², but when calculating gamma, the c² might cancel out.

Wait, given that E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV/c². So gamma would be E/(m c²) but in units where c=1, because in particle physics, E in GeV and m in GeV/c². So E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → but c² is (3e8 m/s)^2. Hmm, but wait, when working in natural units where c=1, the calculations become easier. So perhaps I can proceed by considering c=1 for these calculations.

So gamma would be E/m. So 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV/c². Wait, wait, units
