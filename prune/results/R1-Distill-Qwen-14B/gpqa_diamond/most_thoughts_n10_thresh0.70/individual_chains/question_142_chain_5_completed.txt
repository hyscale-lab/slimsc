Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubits space. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But what does this specific matrix represent?

Wait, let me write it out. The |0⟩⟨0| is a projector onto the state |0⟩, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|. So when I add these two projectors and multiply by 1/2, I'm getting an equal probability for the qubit to be in state |0⟩ or |1⟩, right? Because each term has a coefficient of 1/2. So this must be a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state for a qubit. 

I think the completely mixed state for a qubit is represented by the identity matrix divided by 2. Let's check: the identity matrix for a 2x2 system is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when divided by 2, it becomes [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]]. That matches the given ρ because |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], multiplied by 1/2 gives the same as the identity over 2. Yep, that's right.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this state in qubits space. I remember that qubit states are often represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize all possible states of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector with components (x, y, z). So here, I is the identity matrix, and r·σ is the dot product of r with the Pauli matrices vector.

In this case, our ρ is (I)/2, because |0><0| + |1><1| is I. So that means r·σ must be zero. Therefore, the vector r is (0,0,0). Because if r were anything else, there would be terms from the Pauli matrices adding to the identity.

So the point on the Bloch sphere is at the origin. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, the origin is the center. That corresponds to the completely mixed state, which makes sense because when you're in the center, it's the maximally mixed state with no preference for any direction.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the center. Option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole, corresponding to the state |0⟩. Similarly, the south pole would be |1⟩. But our state is in the middle, so C is the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix being completely mixed implies maximum entropy, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. Yeah, that makes sense. So the geometrical position is at (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a qubit, where the qubit has an equal probability of being in either the state \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). Such a state is maximally mixed and corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the geometrical representation of qubit states.

In general, the density matrix for a qubit can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector that determines the position on the Bloch sphere. For the given \(\rho\), the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) is zero, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin on the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere but not the origin, so it is incorrect.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** This corresponds to the north pole of the Bloch sphere, representing the pure state \(|0\rangle\), so it is incorrect.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** This corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state, so it is correct.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** This corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere but not the origin, so it is incorrect.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
