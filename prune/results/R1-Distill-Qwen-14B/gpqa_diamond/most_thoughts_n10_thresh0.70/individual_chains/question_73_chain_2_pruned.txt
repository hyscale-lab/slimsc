Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, alright, let me think this through step by step.

First, let me read the problem again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed (v_rel) and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds because of the way velocities add in special relativity. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity is different from the classical case. Let me remember how that goes.

The formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same line is: v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, wait, is that correct? Or is it (v2 - v1) divided by something? Let me think. Both are moving in the positive direction, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from astronaut A's frame, what's the speed of astronaut B? Oh, right, because A is the one moving faster, B would appear to be moving at a lower speed relative to A. So v_rel would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Wait, another thought: the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). So let's plug in v1=0.6c and v2=0.5c.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c. So that's approximately 0.14c when rounded. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So I can narrow it down to those two.

Now, the total energy. Hmm, the total energy of the system would be the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m * c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Wait, but each astronaut has a different mass. Oh right, so astronaut A has mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Astronaut B has mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

So let's compute each gamma.

For A: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = (0.6)^2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma for A is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A is gamma * mass * c² = 1.
