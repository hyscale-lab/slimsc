Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, the parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their actual number density in space is uniform. But when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax isn't uniform because of the way parallax relates to distance.

Let me think about the distribution. So, if stars are equally likely to be anywhere in space, their number per volume is uniform. But when we look at them, the number we observe in a given parallax range depends on how the volume relates to distance, which translates into parallax.

Parallax (plx) is 1/distance (d), so d = 1/plx. Now, if we consider a thin shell between d and d + dd, the volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness dd. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, substituting that in, d² is 1/plx², and dd is the change in distance. Let's express everything in terms of plx. Let plx = p, so d = 1/p. Then dd = - (dd p)/p², wait, not sure. Alternatively, considering that when plx increases, the distance decreases. So maybe I should express dd in terms of dp.

Wait, let's see. Since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, rearranging, dd = - d² dp. But d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p². So dd = - (1/p²) dp.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm going about this correctly. Let me think of the number of stars in a certain range of parallax, say from p to p + dp. The corresponding distance range is from d = 1/p to d' = 1/(p+dp), but for small dp, it's approximately from d to d - (dd), where dd is the differential distance. Hmm, maybe it's easier to express the volume in terms of p.

The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π d² dd. So when we change variables from d to p, where p = 1/d, then:

d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So substituting into the volume element:

4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * ( - (1/p²) dp )

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But when considering a small increase in p (dp), the corresponding change in d is negative, but the volume is positive. So I think the absolute value would be:

Volume = 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) dp

Wait, that can't be right. Let me correct. The volume is 4π d² dd. Substitute d = 1/p, so d² is 1/p², and dd is ( -1/p² ) dp. But when considering a small positive dp (increase in p), the corresponding dd is negative (since d decreases). But the volume depends on the absolute value, so the volume element becomes 4π (1/p²) (1/p²) dp. Wait, that would be 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-examine:

d = 1/p → p = 1/d.

dd = derivative of d with respect to p. So dd = - (1/p^2) dp.

So volume element is 4π d^2 dd = 4π (1/p^2) (-1/p^2) dp) = -4π (1/p^4) dp.

But since we're considering a small positive increase in p, dp is positive, and the volume is positive, so we take the absolute value. So the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that can't be right because when p increases, the number of stars should decrease, but I'm trying to find the number per unit p. Wait, the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to the volume, since the density is uniform.

So the number of stars per unit volume is N, so the number in the shell is N * Volume.

So the number per unit p is N * (4π / p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, that's the number in a thin shell, but the question is about the number per unit range of p. So for a given p, the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)" so that would be stars per (unit plx). So the count is (number of stars) / (dp). So, from the above, the number in dp is N * 4π / p^4 * dp. So the number per unit dp is N * 4π / p^4.

So that's how the number of stars per unit plx changes with plx: it's proportional to 1/p^4. So looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that the number might fall off as 1/p^2. Let me think again. Alternatively, if the number of stars is uniform in space, the number per volume is constant. So the number in a shell at radius d with thickness dd is
