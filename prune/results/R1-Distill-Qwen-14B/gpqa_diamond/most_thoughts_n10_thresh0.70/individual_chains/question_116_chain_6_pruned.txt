Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to think through it step by step. Let's break it down.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure. So, a triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests two neighboring protons because a triplet usually arises from coupling with two equivalent protons. The integration of 6H indicates that this is probably a CH2CH3 group, maybe a diethyl group or something similar. Wait, but for a triplet, maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm with 4Hâ€”quartet means three neighboring protons. So each of those protons is next to a group with three Hs. Wait, 4H as a quartet, so maybe it's (CH2)2, like two adjacent -CH2- groups, each with two Hs. So for example, if we have an ethyl group next to another ethyl group, or perhaps a propyl group. Alternatively, think about the splitting. Let me think: a quartet (n+1=4, so n=3) implies coupling with three equivalent protons. So perhaps the 4H are in a -CH2CH2- arrangement, each of the CH2 groups coupling with the other. Wait, but in that case, each would be a quartet. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2CH2- group where each CH2 is attached to another CH2, but perhaps more likely, a -CH2CH2- attached to a CH3.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) suggests two CH3 groups, each with 3H, and they're next to a CH2 group. Because a triplet for CH3 would mean each H is adjacent to two Hs (
