Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I guess that means |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, up to a normalization factor. Then, it asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by Aij being hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states.

Wait, wait. Let's clarify. The operator's matrix has A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 when i=j. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Is that right? Because when i and j are different, it's hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Interesting.

The first part is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Then, find the average value of that operator.

I think the eigenstates of the operator A correspond to its eigenvectors. So, I should probably find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A first. Because when you have an operator, the eigenstates are the possible states you can measure the system to be in when you measure that operator.

So let's start by finding the eigenvalues of A.

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Let me think about the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0.

So (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0 → λ² = (hbar²)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found, but maybe I don't need them right now.

Wait, but the eigenstates are the eigenvectors. So any state can be written as a linear combination of these eigenstates. Our |alpha> is in the basis |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of S_z. But the operator A is S_x perhaps? Because for spin-1/2 particles, S_x has off-diagonal elements. Let me check: for S_x, the matrix is (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]]. So yes, this operator A is the same as S_x multiplied by something. Wait, looking at matrix A: each off-diagonal element is ħ/2, which matches S_x's matrix multiplied by 1. So A is actually the spin-x operator, since S_x = ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]]. So perhaps the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of S_x, which are the spin-left and spin-right states, or something like that. But maybe I don't need to get into that right now.

Wait, but the first part of the problem is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So that would involve expressing |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, then the coefficients' squared magnitudes give the probabilities.

So first, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

But to do that, I should find the eigenstates of A. Let me compute them.

The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] v = 0.

So the equations are:
(-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector can be any scalar multiple of [1,1]. But since we're working in an orthonormal basis, probably the eigenvectors are normalized. So the eigenvector v1 is (1,1)/sqrt(2). Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

The equations are (ħ/2) v1 - (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, actually, I think I've got that right because for S_x, the eigenstates are these combinations.

So the first step is to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

But wait, |alpha> is given in the |up> and |down> basis. So maybe I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> and find the coefficients. Then the probabilities would be the squares of the magnitudes of those coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product between |alpha> and each eigenstate.

But let's first normalize |alpha>. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor. The norm is |1+i|² + |2 -i|².

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2.

|2 -i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4+1=5.

So the norm is 2 +5 =7. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We have:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So let me write |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

Expressing in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

But |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so let me see:

Let me express |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Express |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

So,

alpha = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

Comparing to |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So,

(a + b)/sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
(a - b)/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as equations:

Equation 1: a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Equation 2: a - b = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Let me add and subtract these equations to solve for a and b.

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So a= (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) ).

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (1+i -2 +i ) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So b = (-1 +2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1+i -2 +i = (-1 + 2i) yes.

So,

a = (3) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

b = ( (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7) )

Then, the coefficients c1 and c2 in the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> are a and b, respectively.

So the probabilities would be |a|² and |b|².

Compute |a|²:

a = [3 sqrt(2)] / [2 sqrt(7) ]

So |a|² = (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7 ) ) = (18) / 28 = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Similarly, compute |b|².

b = [ (-1 +2i) sqrt(2) ] / [ 2 sqrt(7) ]

The magnitude squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (2) ] / [ (2^2)(7) ) ].

Wait, |b|² is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * 2 ] / [ (4 *7) ) ]

Because numerator is sqrt(2) multiplied by (-1+2i), so the magnitude squared is ( (1+4) ) * (2) ) / ( (4)(7) ) )

So that's (5 * 2) / 28 = 10/28 =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.64286, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is about 0.36. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So the probabilities would be 9/14 and 5/14. So 9/14 is about 0.6428, which is 0.64 in option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for |b|².

Wait, b is [ (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2) ] / [ 2 * sqrt(7) ]

So |b|² is [ ( (-1 +2i) ) * (sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) ] squared.

Which is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ) * 2 ] / ( (2^2) *7 )

Because |a + ib|² is (a² + b²), and then multiplied by (sqrt(2)/ (2 sqrt(7)))^2.

Wait, the magnitude of (-1 +2i) is sqrt(1 +4) = sqrt(5). So |(-1 +2i)|² is 5.

Then, the term sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) is (2^(1/2)) / (2 7^(1/2)) ) = [ 2^(1/2) ] / [ 2 *7^(1/2) ) ] = same as (1) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

So when you square this, it's 1/( (2)(7) ) = 1/14.

So |b|² is 5 * (1/14) ) =5/14 ≈0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches these approximately.

Wait, but earlier, when I calculated |a|², I think I made a mistake.

Because a is [3 sqrt(2) ] / [2 sqrt(7) ]

So |a|² is (9 * 2 ) / (4 *7 ) = 18 /28 = 9/14 ≈0.6428.

Similarly, |b|² is 5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are about 64% and 36%, which matches option A's first two numbers: 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but the options show A as 0.64, 0.36, and average value hbar/7.

But maybe I should check the average value part.

The average value of the operator A is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, the average would be the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, because if |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>, then <A> = |c1|^2 (hbar/2) + |c2|^2 ( - hbar/2 )

So, |c1|^2 is 9/14, |c2|^2 is 5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)( -hbar/2 ) = [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * hbar/2 ] = (4/14) * hbar/2 = (2/7) * hbar/2 = (2/7)*(hbar/2) = hbar/(7).

So the average value is hbar/7.

Which matches option A's third part.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, and average is hbar/7.

So the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, but let me confirm. Because in the calculation of <A>, we have:

|c1|^2 (lambda1) + |c2|^2 (lambda2).

Which is (9/14)(+hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9-5)/14 ] (hbar/2) = (4/14) (hbar/2) = (2/7) (hbar/2) ) . Wait, 4/14 is 2/7, right. So 2/7 * hbar/2 = (2 * hbar) / (14) )= hbar/7. Yep, that's correct.

So the average value is hbar/7. So option A's third part is correct.

But let me also check the other options in case I made a mistake. For instance, option D is 0.61, 0.29, and 2hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, 0.61 is about 9/14=0.6428, which is closer to 0.64. So option A is matching the calculations.

Wait, but I think that the problem statement says |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so perhaps I should confirm whether I correctly normalized |alpha>.

Yes, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the norm is sqrt( (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) )= sqrt( (1+1) + (4+1) )= sqrt(2+5)=sqrt(7). So |alpha> is 1/sqrt(7) times (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

So, that part is correct.

Now, perhaps an alternative way to compute <A> is to use the matrix representation. Let's try that for practice.

The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. The state |alpha> is (1+i, 2 -i)/sqrt(7) as a column vector.

To compute <A>, which is <alpha| A |alpha>.

So, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, compute A multiplied by |alpha>:

A|alpha> is:

[ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) , (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A |alpha>.

So, |alpha>^dagger is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, the dot product is:

(1-i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7).

Simplify each term:

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) * hbar/(2 *7).

(1-i)(2 -i ) = 2(1) + 1(-i) -i(2) -i^2.

Wait, 1*2=2, 1*(-i)=-i, (-i)*2= -2i, (-i)*(-i)=i² = -1.

So 2 -i -2i + (-1) = (2 -1) + (-3i) )= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) * hbar/(2 *7).

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So combining:

First term: (1-3i) hbar/(14)
Second term: (1+3i) hbar/(14)

Sum: [ (1-3i) + (1+3i) ] hbar/(14) ) = (2) hbar/(14) )= hbar/7.

Which matches the earlier result.

So the average is indeed hbar/7.

So, putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right) \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), yielding \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenvectors are normalized as:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) Basis
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed as:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_1 |+x\rangle + c_2 |-x\rangle.
\]
Substituting \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into the expression for \( |\alpha\rangle \), we solve for \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \):
\[
c_1 = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad c_2 = \frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are given by \( |c_1|^2 \) and \( |c_2|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|c_1|^2 = \left| \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left| \frac{(-1 + 2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]
Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

### Step 4: Average Value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is calculated as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_2|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting \( |c_1|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |c_2|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
