Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem starts by giving a state vector |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means they're the standard spin-up and spin-down states for the z-axis.

The first part asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Then, I also need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So the operator in question is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin states. Let me think about what A looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 or 2. So, the matrix A will have zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, let me write that out. For a 2x2 matrix:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Because when i ≠ j, so (1,2) and (2,1) are ħ/2, and the diagonals (1,1) and (2,2) are 0.

Wait, no, the question says Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j. Oh wait, no, the matrix is defined as A_ij elements. So for a 2x2 matrix, the positions where i ≠ j are (1,2) and (2,1), so those elements are ħ/2. The diagonal elements are zero.

So the matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. 

Now, what does this operator represent? It looks like it's symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable. The eigenstates of this operator are probably something like (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), considering the structure of the matrix.

Wait, let me think about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant of [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]] is λ² - (ħ/2)^2 = 0. So λ² = (ħ²)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The eigenvectors can be found by solving (A - λ I)|v> = 0.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) = [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]]

The equations become (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 1). So the eigenstate is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the eigenvectors satisfy v1 = -v2, so the state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but quantum states are usually normalized, so I should divide by sqrt(2) to make sure they have unit length.

So, the eigenstates of operator A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Now, the first part of the problem is to find the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the initial state is |alpha>. But wait, the initial state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of the z-projection (S_z). However, the operator A is different; its eigenstates are |+> and |->, which are eigenstates of S_x, I think. So, the state |alpha> is given in the basis of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of S_z. To find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (i.e., |+> and |->) and compute the expansion coefficients.

So, let's first normalize |alpha> because the problem states that it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So we need to find the normalization constant.

The state |alpha> is proportional to that vector, so let me calculate its norm (squared magnitude) to find the constant.

The state can be written as (1+i, 2 - i) in the |up>, |down> basis. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i).

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1² - (i)² = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the total norm squared is 2 + 5 = 7. Hence, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->, we can write:

|alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

To find c_+ and c_-, we can express |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ) ] |down>

But this must equal the original expression (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So, equating coefficients:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: ( c_+ + c_- ) = (1+i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )
Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The equations are:

( c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
( c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So, multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

Equation 1: c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
Equation 2: c_+ - c_- = (2 - i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Now, I can add and subtract these equations to find c_+ and c_-.

Adding them:

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3 ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = 3 sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, let me compute that correctly. The numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1 + 2i).

So,

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let's compute the addition:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 +0i, so 3.

So,

c_+ = 3 * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) = (3)/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, the subtraction:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = -1 + 2i.

So,

c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

Wait, perhaps I can factor that as [ (-1 + 2i) ] * (1/ sqrt(14) ), since sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) = 1/sqrt(14).

So, c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)), and c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

So, let's compute |c_+|^2.

c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14). So |c_+|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.643.

Wait, the options have 0.64, 0.54, 0.28, etc. So 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is roughly 0.64.

Then, |c_-|^2 is | (-1 + 2i) |^2 / 14.

The magnitude squared of (-1 + 2i) is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1+4=5. So |c_-|^2 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, checking the options again. Option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which would be 9/14 and 5/14. Because 9/14 is 0.642857, close to 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 in option A. So the probabilities would be 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because |c_+|^2 + |c_-|^2 should sum to 1, as the state is normalized. Let me check.

9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which matches this.

So the first part of the answer seems to be 0.64 and 0.36, which would be option A's first two numbers.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match. Option B is 0.54 and 0.46, which sums to 1, but those numbers don't fit 9/14 and 5/14.

So for the probabilities, the correct values are 9/14 and 5/14, approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the second part is finding the average value of the operator A. The average value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->, and A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, then <A> would be ( |c_+|^2 * (ħ/2) ) + ( |c_-|^2 * (-ħ/2) ).

So,

<A> = (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)( -ħ/2 )

= [ (9)(+1) + (5)(-1) ] * ħ/(2 *14 )

= (9 -5) * ħ/(28 )

= 4 * ħ/(28 ) = ħ/(7 )

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A gives 'hbar/7' as the average value.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So the correct option is option A.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check. Because when I calculated <A>, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, <A> = (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)(-ħ/2 )

So, 9/14 * 1/2 = 9/(28 )

5/14 * (-1/2) = -5/(28 )

So total is (9 -5) / 28 * ħ = 4/28 ħ = 1/7 ħ. So yes, that's correct.

Thus, the answer should be option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average ħ/7.


The problem involves determining the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be calculated.

### Step 1: Matrix Representation of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This matrix is symmetric and Hermitian, making it an observable. Its eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 2: Normalization of \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, calculate the squared norm:
\[
\text{Norm}^2 = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in Terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are expressed as:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]
Substituting these into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we equate coefficients:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle.
\]
Expanding \( |\alpha\rangle \) and matching terms, we solve for \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of Measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
\[
P(|+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(|-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average Value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Since \( A \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the average value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(|+\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(|-\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.
