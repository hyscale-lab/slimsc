Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. There are also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens, and the mass spec has a peak at m/z 45. The options are different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm. Let me break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR. A broad peak around 3000 cm-1 usually indicates O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids? But wait, the presence of another peak at 1700 cm-1 suggests maybe a carbonyl group. 1700 is often a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm-1 peak might be another carbonyl, like an amide or maybe conjugated carbonyl? Or maybe it's a double bond? Wait, alkenes have C=C around 1600-1680. So could it be that?

But wait, another thought: when you have two carbonyl peaks, maybe they're conjugated or part of different functional groups. For example, an ester has a carbonyl around 1700, and an amide has a lower one, but I'm not sure about 1650. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring. Or perhaps one is a ketone and another is an ester.

Wait, but what about the broad peak. Broad peaks in IR are usually O-H, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H is very broad and strong, around 2500-3300. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid? But then, what about the other peaks.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl (C=O) would be
