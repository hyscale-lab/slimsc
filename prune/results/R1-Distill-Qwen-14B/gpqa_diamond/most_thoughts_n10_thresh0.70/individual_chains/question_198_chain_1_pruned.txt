Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, and beta4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with complexation equilibria. Stability constants, beta, tell us how stable a complex is. Higher beta means the complex is more stable because it has a higher tendency to form.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue one is probably the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, because I remember that Co complexes can have different colors based on the number of SCN ligands. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again.

Wait, stability constants usually refer to the formation of complexes. For example, for a metal with ligand L, the formation reaction is M + n L <-> M(L)_n, and the stability constant beta is [ML^n]/([M][L]^n). So in this case, the beta values are for different numbers of SCN- ligands.

Wait, the stability constants are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. I think these correspond to the complexes Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. But sometimes, the order might be different. Wait, sometimes the first beta is for the first ligand, so beta1 is for [CoSCN]^+, beta2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, etc.

But wait, the question mentions dithiocyanato, which I think means two SCN- ligands. So the dithiocyanato complex would be the one where Co is coordinated with two SCN- ions. So
