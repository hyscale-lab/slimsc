Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's read it again. It's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. 

Wait, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, are involved here. The stability constant (β) indicates how strong a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The given stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the complexes form in a stepwise manner, right? Like, Co(SCN)1, then Co(SCN)2, up to Co(SCN)4. But wait, the problem mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is probably the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complex with n=2 or maybe another number. But wait, the question specifically refers to dithiocyanato, which is two thiocyanate ions. So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or maybe it's another complex.

Wait, but wait, cobalt can form different colored complexes. I remember that [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, and [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue. So the question is about the percentage of the blue complex, which is the dithiocyanato, so [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. So we need to find the fraction of this complex compared to all possible Co species.

So the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. 

So the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ for n=0,1,2,3,4. Then, sum all their fractions and find what percentage the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ contributes.

The formula for each complex's concentration is given by the formation constant βn. The general expression for the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+) is βn * [Co^(2+)] * (SCN^-)^n, divided by the sum over all possible species (Σβm [Co]^2+ [SCN]^m ), but I think that's not exactly right.

Wait, the total concentration of all Co species should sum to the initial concentration of Co
