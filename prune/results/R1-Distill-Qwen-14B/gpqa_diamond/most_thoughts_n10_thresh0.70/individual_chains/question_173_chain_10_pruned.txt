Okay, so I have this physics problem about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in energy, so I think I need to use that principle.

The problem says an electron is traveling at v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position is Δx = 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometers are 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

Wait, the question asks for the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. But I remember that the Uncertainty Principle is usually stated in terms of momentum and position. So the formula I know is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, but sometimes people just use Δx Δp ≈ ħ for an estimate, especially when they're looking for a minimum uncertainty.

So first, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Once I have that, I can find the uncertainty in energy because energy is related to momentum via the kinetic energy formula. Since the electron is moving at a high speed, but not relativistic speeds (I think 2e8 m/s is less than the speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s. So non-relativistic, so kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

Wait, but wait: momentum p is mass times velocity. So p = m*v. So Δp would be m*Δv, or maybe Δp is m*v multiplied by some uncertainty in velocity? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the electron's speed is given, but the uncertainty is in position. So I can find Δp using the uncertainty principle.

So the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Let me plug in the numbers.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Wait, but sometimes people use h/(2π), which is the same as ħ. So let me calculate that.

Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 1e-10 meters.

Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) = approximately 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but maybe I should be precise. Let me compute it more accurately:

1.0545718e-34 / (2 * 1e-10) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10
