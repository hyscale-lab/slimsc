Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the Pz operator, ΔPz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue. The uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

First, let me parse the given information. The operator Px has a matrix form given. Similarly for Py and Pz. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So, the system is in an eigenstate of Px, specifically the state corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Wait, I should probably write down the matrices for Pz because that's what we need for the uncertainty. The Pz matrix has the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So, it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. That makes sense because diagonal matrices in their eigenbasis are straightforward.

Now, the state is given. Since it's a column vector, I'll denote it as |ψ⟩. The components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check if this state is normalized. The sum of squares should be 1.

Calculating the squares: ( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/√2)^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 +1/4)= 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. Yes, it's normalized. Good.

Next, since we need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩, I can proceed. But wait, since the state is in the basis of Pz, which is the computational basis for this problem, the expectation values might be easier to compute.

Wait, the state |ψ⟩ in the Pz basis. So, each component corresponds to an eigenstate
