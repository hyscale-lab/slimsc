Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, so first, I should recall what I know about electrostatic potential energy. Since the system is isolated and the charges are fixed in certain positions, the energy is purely electrostatic.

Wait, the energy here refers to the potential energy stored in the system due to the arrangement of charges, right? So, I need to calculate the potential energy between all pairs of charges.

But wait, there's a fixed charge at point P and 12 others at 2 meters away. So, the setup is: one charge at the center (fixed), and 12 others each 2m away from it. So, the 12 charges are each 2 meters from P, but how are they arranged? Are they all on the surface of a sphere around P? I suppose so, but maybe their exact arrangement doesn't matter for the potential energy since each charge at 2m would contribute similarly. Or wait, maybe I should model the system as a point charge at P and multiple charges at 2m.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is 2m away from P. So, the charge at P is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e as well. So the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges would be the same.

But also, the 12 charges are each at 2m from P, but are they all at the same position? No, probably arranged in a way that each is 2m from P but can be anywhere on the sphere of radius 2m. But wait, their mutual distances will affect their potential energy as well.

Wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So, their positions are fixed on a spherical shell of radius 2m. But their exact positions relative to each other can vary, but since the problem is about the minimum
