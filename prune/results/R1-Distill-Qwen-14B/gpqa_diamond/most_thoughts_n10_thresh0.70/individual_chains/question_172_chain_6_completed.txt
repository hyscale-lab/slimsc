Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, okay, let me read it carefully.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I remember that in LTE, the behavior of atoms in a star's atmosphere can be described by the Boltzmann distribution.

I think the Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. The formula I recall is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in energy level i, g_i is the degeneracy, E_i is the energy, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So for the same transition, the ratio of excited atoms in star_1 compared to star_2 is 2. Let me denote the excited state as level i and the lower state as j. So n_i (star 1) / n_j (star 1) is proportional to something, and similarly for star 2.

Wait, but the problem says the excitation is twice as high. So maybe the ratio is n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is twice as much in star_1, so the ratio [n_i1 / n_j1] = 2 * [n_i2 / n_j2].

But wait, the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2. So [n_i1 / n_j1] = 2 * [n_i2 / n_j2]. 

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "twice as excited". So if the excitation is higher, then the number of atoms in the higher energy level (n_i) would be higher. So for the same energy levels, the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So ratio_1 = 2 * ratio_2.

Now, using the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let me write the equations.

For star_1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T_1) )

Similarly, for star_2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k_B T_2) )

Assuming that the g factors (degeneracy) are same for both stars in the same energy levels, since they're both iron atoms. So (g_i/g_j) is same for both. So I can write the ratio_1 as (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and ratio_2 as same but with T2.

So taking the ratio ratio_1 / ratio_2 equals [ (exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / (exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ].

Because (g_i/g_j) cancels out. So ratio_1/ratio_2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute this step by step. Let me take the ratio:

ratio_1 / ratio_2 = [ (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] 

The g terms cancel. So it becomes exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

So the ratio ratio_1/ratio_2 = exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But from the problem statement, ratio_1 = 2 * ratio_2. So ratio_1 / ratio_2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but let me rearrange this.

Let me write it as:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So substituting this:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1-T2) / (T1 T2 )

But wait, I have the value of ΔE given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but wait, 1.38e-23 J is actually k_B * T when T is around 0.01 K, but wait, wait, no. Wait, k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, that's exactly k_B. So ΔE = k_B. Interesting.

So substituting ΔE = k_B into the equation:

ln(2) = (k_B/k_B) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Simplify, the k_B terms cancel:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the equation.

Wait, let me recap. The steps were: using the Boltzmann equation for each star, taking the ratio, substituting the given excitation ratios, and with ΔE equal to k_B, the equation simplifies to ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to the Boltzmann constant \( k_B \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the excitation ratio for each star can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{n_{i}}{n_{j}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right),
\]

where \( n_i \) and \( n_j \) are the populations of the excited and lower energy levels, \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are their degeneracies, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of the two excitation ratios:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}}}{\frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

From the problem, the excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2, so:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}}}{\frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}} = 2.
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k_B \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they do not align with the derived relationship between the temperatures.

Answer: D
