Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor (gamma) relates to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, the time it takes for them to reach the detector's walls probably depends on how fast they're going.

Wait, so the key here is probably the speed of the particles. The faster they go, the less time they take to reach the detector walls. But wait, how does that affect the number of particles reaching the walls?

Oh, I think it's about the decay process. These particles are fast-decaying, meaning they have a short lifetime. So, if the particles are moving very fast, from our lab frame, their lifetime is dilated. So they can travel further before decaying. Thus, a higher gamma would allow them to reach further, hence more particles reaching the detector walls.

The initial situation: gamma is 20, and only 1/3 reach the walls. So the goal is to find a gamma where 2/3 reach. That suggests that as gamma increases, more particles reach the walls. So the new gamma must be higher than 20.

Wait, but how do we model the relation between gamma and the number of particles reaching the walls?

I think it's about the proper time of the particles. The particles' lifetime (proper time) is tau. From our lab frame, their lifetime is gamma * tau. The distance they can travel before decaying is their speed multiplied by this dilated time. Since speed v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles, the distance is approximately c * gamma * tau.

The detector has a radius R = 30 meters. So, for a particle to reach the wall, the distance it travels (L) must be greater than R. The probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall depends on the ratio of R to the maximum
