Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of 13C-NMR signals in the final product E. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is propionaldehyde. I remember that propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So, the structure is an aldehyde group with two CH2 groups attached.

The first reaction is with EDT (which I think is ethyl diisopropyl tin) and BF3. Wait, BF3 is a Lewis acid catalyst. EDT is a reagent used in the formation of enol ethers, right? So, propionaldehyde reacting with EDT and BF3 probably forms an enol ether, which is compound A.

Enol ethers are formed by the alkylation of the enolate. So, the aldehyde would deprotonate to form an enolate, which then gets alkylated by EDT. But wait, EDT has three ethyl groups attached to a tin, so maybe it's a source of ethyl groups. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the exact mechanism, but I think the product A would be an enol ether where the aldehyde oxygen is replaced by an OEt group. So, the structure would be CH2CH2OCH2CH3 or something like that. Wait, no, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. When we form the enol ether, the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an ethoxy group. So, the molecule becomes CH2CH2OCH2CH3? Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me think again. The enol form would be CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3? No, wait. The aldehyde is RCHO. The enolate would be RCH- with a negative charge on the alpha carbon. When it reacts with EDT, which is a strong alkylating agent, it would add an ethyl group. So, perhaps A is CH2CH2-OCH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure.

Wait, another approach. Propional
