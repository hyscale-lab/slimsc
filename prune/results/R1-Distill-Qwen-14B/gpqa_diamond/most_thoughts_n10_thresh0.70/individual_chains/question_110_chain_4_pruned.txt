Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. The key is to figure out which stars are bright enough to be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. Let me recall what I know about these instruments.

ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, and from the question, it can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait: the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, no, no. Wait, I think it's the other way around. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V magnitude 17 is fainter than one with, say, 16. So if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with V mag less than 17. Because the scale is inverted. So, the apparent V magnitude has to be less than 17 for ESPRESSO to detect it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V magnitude less than 16.

Wait, actually, I think the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, no, no. Wait, no. Magnitude scale: lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, the apparent V mag must be ≤17. For HIRES, it's ≤16. Because ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So any star that's brighter than (apparent mag ≤) both 17 and 16 would be detectable by both.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me clarify. Let's say a star has apparent magnitude 15. That's bright enough for both. But a star with apparent mag 17 is only detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. Because HIRES can only go up to 16. So for a star to be detected by
