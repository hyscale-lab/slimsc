Okay, let's try to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. So, I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16. So any star that's brighter than 16 in V magnitude can be seen by both, right?

Wait, no. Wait a second. Because the apparent magnitude is what matters here, not absolute. Because absolute magnitude is how bright the star actually is, but apparent is how bright it appears from Earth. So I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star except maybe Star2 and Star5, since some might already have apparent V given.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5 mag, located at 10 pc. Oh wait, absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) at 10 pc. So if it's at 10 pc, then m = M. So m = 15.5. But wait, ESPRESSO can handle up to 17 mag, so 15.5 is brighter than that. So Star1 can be detected by ESPRESSO. What about HIRES? HIRES can go up to 16 mag. 15.5 is brighter than 16? No, wait, lower magnitude means brighter. So 15.5 is less than 16, so it's brighter. So HIRES can see it. Because m less than 16 (since it's 15.5) is brighter than the limit. So Star1 is observable by both.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5 mag, and distance is 5 pc. Wait, but the question is about whether the apparent magnitude is within the spectrograph's limit. Since Star2's apparent magnitude is 16.5. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.5 is okay. HIRES can go up to 16, so 16.5 is higher, so HIRES can't see it. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5 mag, but wait, no, Star3 has an E(B-V) of
