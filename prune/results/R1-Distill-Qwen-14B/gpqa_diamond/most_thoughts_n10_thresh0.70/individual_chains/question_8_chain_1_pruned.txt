Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about plant disease resistance. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is that we have a high-throughput experiment on white lupine looking for genes contributing to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3.

They made knock-out mutants: g1, g2, g3, and double mutants like g1g2, etc. We know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are proteins that help turn on other genes. If a gene is upstream, it's like the first step in a pathway.

The experiment tested these mutants against the pathogen. The resistance levels are given in percentages relative to the control (which is 100%). So, the higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant is.

Looking at the results:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less resistant than wild-type, but not as bad as some others.
- g2: 0% resistance. So, these plants are completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance.
- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's really bad.
- g2g3: 0%.
- g1g2: 0%.

I need to figure out the interaction between these genes based on the resistance levels.

Hmm. Let's think about what each result implies.

First, the wild-type has 100% resistance. So, when any of the mutants have lower resistance, they're worse off.

Looking at the single mutants:

g2 is 0% resistance. That's the lowest. So, knocking out G2 completely abolishes resistance. So G2 might be a key gene, perhaps a transcription factor, because if it's knocked out, everything downstream might not work. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, it could be regulating other genes needed for resistance.

G1 mutant has 75%. So, without G1, the plant is less resistant but not completely susceptible. G3 mutant is at 50%, so worse than G1 but not as bad as g2.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 and g2g3 are both 0%. That suggests that when G2 is knocked out along with another gene, the resistance is gone. But wait, when G2 is already knocked out, maybe the other gene is downstream or not doing much. Hmm.

But wait, what about the double mutants where G2 is not involved? The only one is g1g3, which is at 10%. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even worse than either single mutant.

So, let's think about the hierarchy. If a double mutant has lower resistance than either single mutant, that could mean that the two genes are working in the same pathway. Because if G1 is knocked out, you lose some resistance; if G3 is knocked out, you lose more. But when both are knocked out, the effect is additive or synergistic.

Wait, but in this case, when G1 and G3 are both knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than both single mutants. So, their effects add up.

But what about when G2 is involved? For example, g1g2 is 0%. Since g2 is 0%, adding another knockout doesn't change the result. Same with g2g3.

So maybe G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, it could activate both G1 and G3. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but G1's mutant is at 75%. So, if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then without G2, G1 wouldn't be expressed.
