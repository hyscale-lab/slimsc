Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, let me understand the problem. The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. N is the normalization constant, which they've given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). The parameters here are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

The non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure, del_b. The formula for del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but how does this work? I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because Gaussian states are easier to handle, and non-Gaussian features are often useful for certain quantum computing tasks.

So, the state |psi> here is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, right? Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition can lead to non-Gaussian features. But wait, when is such a state Gaussian? Because if the state is a single coherent state, it's Gaussian. If it's a superposition, it's non-Gaussian, except maybe in some cases.

Wait, the problem is about the non-Gaussianity of this state. So, when would this state be Gaussian? Oh wait, if the superposition is between orthogonal states, perhaps? Or maybe when the superposition coefficients form a Gaussian distribution? Hmm, not sure.

But the question is to compute the non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. The relative entropy between rho and tau, where tau is a Gaussian state.

Wait, but I've heard that the relative entropy between a state and the closest Gaussian state is a measure of its non-Gaussianity. So, to compute del_b, we need to find the density matrix rho of |psi>, then find the reference Gaussian state tau (probably the closest Gaussian state to rho), then compute the relative entropy between them.

But computing that from scratch might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about whether the state is Gaussian or not.

Wait, coherent states are Gaussian. A superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. But wait, are there cases where the superposition is Gaussian? For example, if the superposition coefficients are such that the state ends up being another Gaussian state.

Wait, Gaussian states are closed under certain operations. For example, linear combinations (i.e., adding coherent states and multiplying by scalars) would result in Gaussian states. Wait, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, coherent states are Gaussian. If you have a superposition like a|alpha> + b|beta>, with |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1, is that Gaussian? No, because the Wigner function of a coherent state is Gaussian, but a superposition of two coherent states (unless
