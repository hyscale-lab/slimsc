Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the decay distance. I think that has to do with how far the particle travels before it decays.

The problem gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And the options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, the mean decay distance... I think the formula involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right! The mean decay length (L) is given by the product of the particle's velocity (v) times its lifetime (τ). So L = v * τ.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, the lifetime is related to the decay width Γ. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width Γ. Specifically, τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact relation. Oh wait, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units could be tricky here.

Wait, I think the decay width Γ is given in MeV, and I need to convert that into energy units that work with ħ. Let me think. I remember that ħ
