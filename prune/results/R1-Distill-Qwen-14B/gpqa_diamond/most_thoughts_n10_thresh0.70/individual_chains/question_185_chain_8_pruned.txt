Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Hamiltonian operator and finding its eigenvalues. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and n is a unit vector, so it's some direction in space. And ε is an energy constant.

Wait, eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. I remember that the eigenvalues are the possible energy levels of the system. For a Pauli matrix vector like this, the structure is familiar. Oh, right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and when you take their dot product with a unit vector, you get a matrix proportional to the spin operator.

Wait, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So S · n would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, how does that tie into the Hamiltonian here?

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So that's ε times the dot product of σ and n. Since σ is the Pauli matrices, their eigenvalues are ±1 when multiplied by a unit vector. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1 along their respective axes. So when you take a unit vector n, σ · n would be a matrix that, when diagonalized, has eigenvalues ±1 multiplied by some factors.

Wait, let me think. The general form for a spin-½ system's Hamiltonian is H = ω · S, where ω is some vector (like a magnetic field), and S is the spin operator. In that case, the eigenvalues are ± (ħ ω)/2, right? Because each component of S is (ħ/2) σ_i, so when you have a direction, the eigenvalues would be ± ħ ω/2.

But in this problem, H is ε multiplied by σ · n. So let's break that down. σ · n is a matrix, and since n is a unit vector, this matrix has eigenvalues ±1. Because for any direction n, the eigenvalues of σ · n are +1 and -1. So if we have H = ε (σ · n), then the eigenvalues of H would be ε times those ±1. So that would give eigenvalues ± ε.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is plus ε and minus ε. So that would be the answer. But wait, I thought sometimes the Pauli matrices are scaled with ħ/2, but in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as ε σ · n, not involving ħ. Let me check the units. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless because they are 2x2 matrices with trace 0 and determinant 1, so σ · n is dimensionless. H has dimension energy,
