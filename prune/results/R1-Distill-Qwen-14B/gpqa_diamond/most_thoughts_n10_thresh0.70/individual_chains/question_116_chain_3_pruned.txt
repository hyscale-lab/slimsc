Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully.

Compound A has two signals in proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us about the structure. Let me think about what this could be.

A triplet at 0.9 ppm usually indicates methyl groups (CH3) that are adjacent to another CH2. The quartet at 1.3 ppm suggests another set of protons, maybe another CH2 group next to something else. The integration is 6H for the triplet and 4H for the quartet. So that's 10 hydrogens in total. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted alkane or something.

Common structures with two sets of CH2 groups. Could it be neopentyl group? Neopentyl has a central CH2 connected to two CH(CH3)2 groups. Let me think about the NMR. If the structure was (CH2)2C(CH3)2, but wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethane.

Wait, the triplet for 6H. Let me think about splitting. Each triplet implies two neighboring protons. So each CH3 group is next to a CH2. For example, if there are two CH2 groups each next to a CH3, like (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, wait. Or maybe (CH2CH2) structure. Alternatively, think about 2,2-dimethylpropane derivatives, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests two methyl groups, each with three H, and each coupled to a CH2. So maybe each CH3 is attached to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, that would be a triplet for the CH2 next to two CH3's. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH
