Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a state |psi> which is a Schrödinger cat state. The state is a superposition of two coherent states: cos(phi)|alpha> and sin(phi)|-alpha>, all divided by a normalization constant N. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). Oh, right, because the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha> is exp(-2|alpha|²) since coherent states are over-complete and have these exponential overlaps.

The task is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, and coherent states are Gaussian. So when the state is a superposition of Gaussian states, it's non-Gaussian. But the question is about the non-Gaussianity measure, specifically using relative entropy of entropies.

I remember that for a Gaussian state, the density matrix has a certain form, maybe like a Gaussian distribution in phase space. The relative entropy would compare the state's entropy to that of a Gaussian.

But wait, the problem says the reference state is a Gaussian state. So tau is Gaussian, and rho is the given non-Gaussian state. The non-Gaussianity here would be the relative entropy between rho and tau. But how do we compute this?

Let me think. The relative entropy (also called Kullback-Leibler divergence) is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the given del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Oh, wait, the problem says that del_b is exactly that: the difference between rho's entropy and tau's entropy. So del_b would be the relative entropy of rho with respect to tau, but only if rho and tau are probability distributions, but in quantum terms, I'm not sure.

Wait, no, actually, the relative entropy is usually S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln(rho / tau)) ) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in this case, the problem gives del_b as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Hmm. That's different from the standard relative entropy. Maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity here is being measured in another way. Wait, Gaussian states have a certain structure, and perhaps when the state is Gaussian itself, the nG would be zero. Because if the state is Gaussian, then it's not non-Gaussian, so nG should be zero.

But wait, the given state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>
