Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a particle decays, its mass has to be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into because energy and momentum have to be conserved. Oh right, the rest mass energy has to be enough to create the daughter particles.

The question says the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Wait, I should probably think about what particles this can decay into. The Lagrangian given is about the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The term is something like -λf ψ_f bar ψ_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that's just the Yukawa coupling kind of interaction. So X can interact with fermions via these couplings.

The possible decay products are listed in the options, so I need to check which fermions have masses such that twice their mass is less than 6 GeV. Let me think of the masses of the known fermions.

Starting with the top quark, because I know it's the heaviest. The top quark's mass is around 173 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks. So any option that includes t tbar can be eliminated. Looking at the options, option C includes t tbar, so that's out.

Next, let's think about the bottom quark. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV or so. Wait, the exact mass might vary but I think it's around 4.1 to 4.7 GeV. So 2 times that is around 8-9 GeV. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the X is 6 GeV. So 6 GeV is less than 8 GeV? No, because 6 GeV is 6,000 MeV, and the bottom quark is about 4,700 MeV. Wait, no, wait: mass of the bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV. So twice that would be about 9.4 GeV. Oh, wait no: the decay process would require the boson X to have mass >= 2 * m_fermion. So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, 2*m_fermion must be less than or equal to X's mass.

Wait wait, X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion f, if m_f * 2 ≤ 6 GeV, then f can be a decay product.

So what are the possible fermions?

Let me list the masses of the fermions:

- Up quark: about 2 MeV (so 0.002 GeV), 2m ~ 0.004 GeV. So yes, 6 GeV is way more than enough. Same for down quark, around 4-5 MeV, 2m is about 10 MeV. So X can decay into uū, dđ, etc.

But wait, up and down quarks are light. So their masses are negligible compared to 6 GeV. So X can decay into any of them, as
