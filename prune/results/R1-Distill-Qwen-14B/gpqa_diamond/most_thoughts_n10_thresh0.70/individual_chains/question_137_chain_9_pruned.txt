Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through what I know and what the question is asking.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T≈0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0=π/4 and U0=190 kV.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are numbers, so I need to calculate the number of turns the proton makes during its acceleration.

Hmm, I remember that in cyclotrons and similar devices, the particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The key thing here is that in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage changes as the particle's speed increases. But wait, wait, in this problem, the voltage's frequency is probably related to the particle's motion.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So the frequency ν is a function of α, which I think is the angle of rotation or the step in the phase. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe α refers to the relativistic parameter, like the Lorentz factor? Hmm, protons are being accelerated to high energies, so relativistic effects might come into play. But the problem says the initial KE is negligible, so maybe they're using non-relativistic equations first.

Wait, the kinetic energy increases from 0 to 950 MeV. Wait, wait, 950 MeV is a lot. For a proton, the rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², so at 950 MeV, it's a highly relativistic particle. So relativistic considerations are definitely important here.

I think in a cyclotron, the time between each acceleration is the period of the electric field, which depends on the frequency. But because the proton's velocity is high, the cyclotron frequency might change as the proton gains energy.

Wait, in
