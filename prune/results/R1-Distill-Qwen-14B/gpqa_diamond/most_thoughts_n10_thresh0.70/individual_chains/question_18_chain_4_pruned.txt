Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the elemental abundances in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem carefully.

So, the given data:

- Star_1's mass is 1.5 solar masses.
- Star_2's mass is 1.2 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is higher than the Sun by 0.3.
- [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. So, magnesium to silicon ratio in Star_2 is higher than the Sun by 0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So, the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So, magnesium to hydrogen in Star_2 is same as the Sun.

They also give the Sun's photospheric composition:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 10^-4.5. Which is 3.16e-5.
Wait, wait: no, wait. Let me compute that. 10^-4.5 is the same as sqrt(10^-9) which is about 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So, log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So, nMg/nH =1e-5.

So, the Sun's nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

The question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi1 / nH1) divided by (nSi2 / nH2). Or wait, wait: the ratio is nSi_1 / nSi_2, but in the same H scale? Hmm, no, probably it's (nSi in Star_1) over (nSi in Star_2). Because the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased: 'the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.' So, it's [Si]_1 divided by [Si]_2.

Wait, the notation for elemental abundances is usually [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

But in this problem, they're giving [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2.

So, to find the [Si/H] for each
