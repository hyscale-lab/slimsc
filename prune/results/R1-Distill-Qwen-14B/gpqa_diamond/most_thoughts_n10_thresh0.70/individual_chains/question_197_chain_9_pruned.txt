Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... I remember that's a reaction called the Hittig reaction, which is used to make alkenes. Oh right, so it's a type of Wittig reaction but without a strong base. The Wittig reagent is usually generated from an alkyl halide and triphenylphosphine, then treated with a strong base. But wait, red phosphorus and HI... I think that's the Hittig reaction where it's used to prepare alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. Oh, wait, no, the Hittig reaction typically is used to make alkenes from aldehyde or ketone groups. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group.

Looking at the IR data first. The peaks are: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, 1450, 1450. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 suggests O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl peak, which could be a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm-1). Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but the 1720 might lean towards a carboxylic acid because esters are a bit higher or lower? Wait, no, esters are around 1730-1750. So 1720 might be a carboxylic acid. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions could be aromatic C=C stretching. So possible that the starting material is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's see:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. So that fits with the IR data. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted because they are a doublet. So maybe two protons ortho to substituents.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, probably the other pair of aromatic protons. So the aromatic ring looks para-substituted, like in a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents opposite each other, or maybe a meta substituent but more likely para.
Wait, I think in a para-substituted benzene, the protons could be split into two doublets. Let's think: if the substituent is at position 4, then the two H's ortho would be at positions 2 and 6, which would be a doublet if they're next to substituents. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituent is at position 4, so the adjacent positions (3 and 5?)
