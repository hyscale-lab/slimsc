Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, alright, let me think through this.

First, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Wait, like maybe an ester or an alkyne? Because I think when you have an ester and you treat it with something like HI, it might undergo some kind of substitution or cleavage. Or wait, maybe red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or something else. Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking at the data given, I'll start by analyzing the IR and NMR spectra. The IR shows strong peaks. The big peaks are in the 3400–2500 cm-1 region, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is a good indicator for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions suggest possible conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings. Aromatic rings often have absorption around 1600 cm-1. So maybe this compound has both a carbonyl and an aromatic ring.

Now looking at the NMR. The 10.5 ppm peak as a broad singlet (bs, 1H) is probably an acidic proton, like an aldehyde proton or maybe an -OH group, but wait, at 10.5, that's more aldehyde than alcohol. But wait, if it's an aldehyde, then the IR would have a peak around 2800-2700 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. Oh wait, the IR here goes up to 2500, but the 3400–2500 region might include aldehydes. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH in a carboxylic acid? But their protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but the IR has a 1720 peak, which could be a carboxylic acid's carbonyl. Wait, no, carboxylic acids
