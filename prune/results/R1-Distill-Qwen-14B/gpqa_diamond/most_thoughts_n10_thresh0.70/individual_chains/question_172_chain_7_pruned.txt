Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

So, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is often explained by the Boltzmann distribution. Because the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use that.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—it's close to the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, right! So that's probably not a coincidence. So the energy difference ΔE is equal to the Boltzmann constant (k) multiplied by the temperature difference term. Or wait, no—the energy difference between levels is given, and the Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of those levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T))

Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both levels, which the question doesn't mention, so I think we can ignore that part, or maybe it's a typo. Wait, the question says "twice as excited", so I think it's the ratio of populations.

Wait, the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for each star, we can write the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state). Let me define it more clearly.

Let me denote the excited state as level E_upper and the lower as E_lower. So the energy difference ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

For star 1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = 2. Because it's twice as excited.

For star 2, the ratio is n2_upper / n2_lower = 1, perhaps? Wait, no—the question says star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2 times the ratio for star_2? Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, the question states "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation is higher in star_1. So, the population in the excited state is higher in star_1. So, for star_1, n_upper is higher than in star_2.

Wait, but the ratio of excited to lower state is what's given. So for each star, the ratio is:

For star 1: (n1_upper) / (n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

Wait,
