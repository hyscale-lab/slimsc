Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember something about this from my studies. So, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium.

Wait, LTE means that each small region of the star's photosphere is in thermal equilibrium, so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a system to temperature. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k*T)), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call the excited state as level 1 and the lower state as level 2. So, E_1 is higher than E_2 by delta E. The ratio of excitation is given as n1/n2 = 2 for star_1, and n1/n2 = 1 for star_2? Wait, no, wait. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So probably, the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, it's 1? Or maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2's ratio. Hmm, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read the question again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for the same energy level, the excitation (i.e., the number of atoms in that level) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So for star_1, n1/n2 ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. No, no, it's that the excitation for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for the same transition, star_1's population ratio is 2, star_2's is 1?

Wait, but the question is about the effective temperatures of the stars. So each star has its own temperature, T1 and T2, and we need to relate them using the given excitation ratio.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

For star 1: (n1_1)/(n2_1) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: (n1_2)/(n2_2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T2) )

But wait, the question states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So perhaps (n1_
