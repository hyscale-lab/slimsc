Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. I remember that when dicarboxylic acids lose water, they can form cyclic anhydrides, typically five-membered rings because they're more stable. The dehydration would involve the two carboxylic acid groups.

The anhydride has some specific NMR data. Let's look at that. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. In 1H NMR, 7 ppm is typically where aromatic protons appear. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, the anhydride might form a ring, maybe a five-membered one. But if the alkene is cis, does that relate to the structure of the anhydride?

Wait, the anhydride's 13C spectrum has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about what those carbons could be. 137 ppm is in the range of spÂ² carbons. 165 ppm is high, which is typical for carbonyl carbons, like ketones or esters. So, in an anhydride, the carbonyl carbons would be around 165-180 ppm. So that fits. The 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe part of a double bond or an aromatic ring? But wait, the 1H NMR only has a single peak at 7 ppm, which could be an aromatic proton if there's an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe a vinyl proton if there's a double bond present.

Wait, but the starting material is a cis-alkene. When the acid dehydrates, the anhydride would have a double bond if it's a cyclic structure? Or maybe the dehydration eliminates the double bond. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: Dehydration of a diacid to form an anhydride usually involves losing two H2O molecules, but wait, actually, for a dicarboxylic acid, dehydration forms an anhydride by losing one water molecule. So, the structure would have a ring connecting the two carbonyl oxygens.

Wait, but if the starting compound is a cis-dioic acid with a cis alkene, then during dehydration, the double bond in the dicarboxylic acid would influence the structure of the anhydride. Alternatively, perhaps the dehydration doesn't involve the alkene. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the anhydride isn't aromatic. Let me think about the NMR again. The 1H NMR has a single
