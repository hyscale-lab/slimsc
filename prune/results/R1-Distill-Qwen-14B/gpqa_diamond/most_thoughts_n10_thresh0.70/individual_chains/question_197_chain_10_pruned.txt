Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided are the IR and 1H NMR spectra of Compound X.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which might indicate an O-H stretch or possibly an alkyne. But wait, the peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, Compound X likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR. Let's break down each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes deshielded more, like in aromatic aldehydes. But wait, another possibility is an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, but that's usually a broad peak too. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so if it's a carboxylic acid, that might fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. For example, like para-substituted benzene. The doublets suggest a coupling pattern consistent with two substituents on the ring, each with two protons. So maybe it's a meta arrangement? Wait, no, because 4 protons in two sets of doublets suggests two substituents with two protons each, so a para-substituted ring with two groups. Or maybe one substituent with two protons each in para positions, like two identical groups opposite each other.

Wait, looking at the integration: 8.0 ppm is 2H, and 7.2 ppm is also 2H. So perhaps this is a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that each have two equivalent protons. Or maybe a single substituent that's a group with two protons, like a methoxy group? But in that case, the coupling would be different. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two identical substituents each with two protons in their structure. Hmm.

Wait another thought: the integration of 2H and 2H suggests that the aromatic ring has two substituents, each causing two protons each to be in certain environments. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, each substituent having two protons... but that's not possible because each substituent would only have one position. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted ring with two substituents each having two protons, but that would cause more splitting.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with one substituent that has two protons adjacent to it. Like a para-substituted ring where each substituent is a -CH2- group? Or perhaps a substituent like -CH2CH2- or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about common NMR patterns. Two doublets in the aromatic region with 2H each could be a para-disubstituted benzene with two different substituents each causing a coupling. Or perhaps a single substituent with two protons, like a vinyl group? Or
