Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) acid catalyzed reaction, which is the Clemmensen reduction. Wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, right? Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing reactions. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction or maybe in the elimination reactions. Wait, wait, wait. No, I think when you have a carbonyl group and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it might lead to a substitution. Oh wait, wait, wait, no. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the elimination of a carbonyl group, turning a ketone or aldehyde into an alkene. Because I think that's the Haworth reaction. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Alternatively, when a carbonyl group is treated with HI and something else, like in the case of a ketone, you might get a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by iodide. Let me think. Oh, right! The formation of an alkoxide intermediate. So, for example, a ketone reacting with HI and red phosphorus (which is a catalyst in some reactions) would lead to the formation of an alkyl iodide. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again
