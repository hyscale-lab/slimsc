Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are four different expressions for the energy E, each involving quantum numbers n_x and n_y, and some coefficients multiplied by ħ*sqrt(k/m).

Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be separated into radial and angular parts. Oh right, because if the potential depends on r and θ, and if it can be expressed as a function only of r plus a function of θ, then the Schrödinger equation might be separable.

So let me look at the potential V(r,θ). It's (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, so that can be written as (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ) kr². Wait, no, more accurately, it's (1/2) kr² [ 1 + 3 cos²θ ]? Wait, no: Let me compute the coefficients correctly. Oh wait, no. Wait, the first term is (1/2) kr², and the second is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So combining the two, V(r,θ) = (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ ) kr². Alternatively, factor out kr²: V = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, but maybe it's better to write this as V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Then perhaps I can see whether this can be rewritten in terms of angular momentum or something else. Alternatively, maybe express the potential in terms of cos(2θ), because the cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity.

Wait, cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² [1 + 3*(1+cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that: 1 + 3*(1/2 + cos2θ/2) = 1
