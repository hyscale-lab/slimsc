Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning about titrations and pH calculations. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, okay. So first step, I think, is to figure out the concentrations after dilution, then determine what happens during the titration at 25% and equivalence point.

Wait, let me break it down. First, when we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the initial volume is 20 mL, and we add 20 mL of water, making the total volume 40 mL. So the concentration will change because of dilution.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). Plugging in the numbers: M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 20 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / (40) = 1 / 40? Wait wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, then divided by 40, which is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a minute, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. But when we dilute it, the degree of dissociation increases a bit, but for the initial step, I think we just need the concentration.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na+ + H2O.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will
