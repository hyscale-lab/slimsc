Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that nitrile groups are introduced. Oh wait, that's the nucleophilic addition. So in the presence of a base, the ketone can add a cyanide ion. But wait, butan-2-one is a cyclic ketone? No, wait, it's just a regular ketone. So when NaCN is added, it's a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon. But then what happens next?

Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone has been converted into a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, I think I remember that when a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN- in a basic solution), it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation. So the reagent would be a source of CN- under basic conditions. But wait, in the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN and
