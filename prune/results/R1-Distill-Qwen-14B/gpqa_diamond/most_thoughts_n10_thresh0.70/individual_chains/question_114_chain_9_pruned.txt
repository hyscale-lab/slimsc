Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. There are two reactions given, and I have to pick the correct options A and B from the choices provided.

First Reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
Second Reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

So the options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B reagents.

Let me start with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is a ketone (acetone). NaCN is sodium cyanide, and when a ketone reacts with CN- in a substitution reaction, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition. So in this case, the NaCN would act as a source of CN- ions. So the reaction is probably adding CN- to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN is added, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. So, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH(CH3)OH)CNCH2CH2? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No. Wait, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN with three carbons? Hmm, maybe I should think about the product structure again.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with Na
