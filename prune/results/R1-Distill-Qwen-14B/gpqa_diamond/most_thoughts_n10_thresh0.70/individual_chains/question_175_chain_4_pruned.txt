Okay, so I have this physics problem about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Since it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The problem is asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f in terms of lambda.

I remember that when a charge distribution oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the source. Since this is spheroidal and symmetric about the z-axis, the radiation should have some angular dependence, probably peaking along the axis of symmetry.

Wait, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum along the equatorial plane, which is perpendicular to the dipole axis. But wait, in this case, the charge distribution is oscillating—maybe it's similar to a dipole's radiation but perhaps with a different pattern.

Wait, no. An oscillating dipole radiates most strongly perpendicular to its axis. So the maximum radiation would be at theta = 90 degrees, right? But the question is about a spheroid. Hmm, not sure if that's a dipole or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a quadrupole or higher-order multipole. Wait, but for an oscillating charge distribution, I think the dominant term is the dipole radiation. So maybe the radiation pattern is similar to that of a dipole.

In dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) is proportional to (1 + cos^2 theta). The maximum occurs when cos theta is ±1, which is at theta=0 and 180 degrees. Wait, wait, no: Wait, (1 + cos^2 theta) is maximum when cos theta is maximum in absolute value. So that occurs at theta=0 and 180 degrees. Wait, no, wait: Let me compute that. If theta is the angle from the z-axis, then when theta is 0, cos theta is 1; when theta is 180, cos theta is -1, but squared is 1. So the maximum is at theta=0 and 180, which is along the axis. Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I was confusing
