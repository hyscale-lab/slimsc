Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, with various pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, they react in a neutralization reaction. The pH changes depending on how much base has been added.

First, I think I should find out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, no—wait, wait. When you dilute, the volume increases. So initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. Oh wait, units are in cm³, which is milliliters, so let me convert to liters when doing calculations.

Wait, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, I should figure out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The acetic acid is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ added.

Wait, no. 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So actually, perhaps I should think in terms of moles.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. So at 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. Since NaOH
