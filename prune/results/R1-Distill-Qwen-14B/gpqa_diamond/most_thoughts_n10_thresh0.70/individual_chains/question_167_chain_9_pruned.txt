Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the non-Gaussianity of a particular Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so the superposition of them might create a non-Gaussian state, which is what a Schrödinger cat state is about. Non-Gaussian states are important in quantum computing because they can't be efficiently simulated by classical computers.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). So, N depends on phi and alpha. The problem gives phi as -pi/4 and alpha as 0.5. Let me plug those in.

Wait, but before that, the non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix. So, the non-Gaussianity is the difference in the von Neumann entropies between the state and a reference Gaussian state.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because usually, relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (REG) is defined as S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, in the problem statement, it's stated as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). So, a positive value indicates non-Gaussianity.

But wait, for pure states, rho is a pure state, and tau is a Gaussian state. So, the entropy S(rho) for a pure state is zero, because rho is |psi><psi|, so ln rho is zero, and trace of that is zero. Wait, no. Wait, for a pure state, the density matrix rho is idempotent, so ln rho would be ln |
