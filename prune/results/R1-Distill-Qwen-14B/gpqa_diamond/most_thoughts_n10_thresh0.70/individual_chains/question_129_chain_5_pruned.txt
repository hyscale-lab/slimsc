Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions, and I need to figure out what compound E is based on the given information.

First, the problem describes a reaction scheme with Compounds A to E. Let me jot down what each step does.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints provided. Let me look at the hints.

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So, I think this is a Wittig reaction. The product is an alkene. The structure given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure.

So, cyclopentane ring. At position 4, there's a propylidene group attached. Propylidene is like CH2-C(CH3)=. Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)-. Or maybe it's the substituent is on the adjacent carbon. Let me visualize it.

The parent ring is cyclopentane. The substituents at positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups. And at position 4, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is a group like CH2-C(CH3)=. But wait, the Wittig reaction forms an alkene, right? So the ylide adds to the carbonyl group of compound A, forming an alkene.

So, the reaction is A (which has a carbonyl group, like a ketone) reacting with the ylide to form an alkene. So when A reacts with the ylide, it forms the cyclopentane with the substituents as described.

So, compound A is probably a cyclopentanone derivative. Because in a Wittig reaction, the ylide attacks a carbonyl group. So if the product has an alkene, then the starting carbonyl would be adjacent to that.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me structure this: the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2. Then, on carbon 4, there's a substituent that's propan-2-ylidene. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=. Or maybe it's a substituent that's attached via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's a propenyl group. So, maybe the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)=. Hmm, not sure, but
