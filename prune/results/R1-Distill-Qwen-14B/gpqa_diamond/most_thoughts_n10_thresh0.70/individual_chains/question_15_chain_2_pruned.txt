Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the mass of the star (M). So, shorter period means smaller a, so closer in.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But same radius, which is a bit weird because more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe it's a slightly evolved star or something. So same radius for both stars, R*1 = R*2.

I need to find the probability of transit for each planet. The transit probability (P) is proportional to (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (a / (a * sin i)), where i is the inclination of the orbit. Wait, no, actually, the probability is given by (R_p / R_*)² multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²))^½, but since both orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies. Wait, no, that's the formula for the duration or something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the probability of transit is given by the ratio of the size of the star to the distance, but I think it's actually (R_p / a)² multiplied by something else. Or wait, another approach. The probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / (1 - e²))½, but e=0 here, so it's (R_p / R_*)². Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The transit probability is calculated as the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) to the star's radius, but actually, no. Let me get this straight. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is given
