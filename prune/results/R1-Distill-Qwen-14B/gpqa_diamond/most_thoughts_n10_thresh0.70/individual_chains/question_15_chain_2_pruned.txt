Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me start by recalling what I know about transits.

So, transit probability depends on several factors. From what I remember, the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh, right, the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us, which increases the chance of it passing in front of the star.

Wait, but the question already mentions that both planets have been detected via the RV method. Oh, right, the RV method gives us the minimum mass and the orbital period, but not the inclination. For transit, inclination is key. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for the RV method, the RV signal depends on the mass and the inclination. So if the RV method has detected the planet, that means that the planet's orbit is at least edge-on enough to cause a wobble. But for transit, the orbit needs to be exactly edge-on. So even if RV detects, the transit probability depends on the actual inclination.

But maybe the question is simplifying things by considering that the transit probability is the same as the probability that the RV method sees the planet. Or maybe not. Wait, I think the transit probability is actually related to the geometry, which is dependent on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance and the planet's size.

Wait, the formula for the probability of transit is
