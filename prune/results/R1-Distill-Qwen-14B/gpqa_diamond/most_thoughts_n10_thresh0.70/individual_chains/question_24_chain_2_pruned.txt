Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, the question involves two mixtures, X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. There's a lot going on, so I'll break it down.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double bonds, like alkenes or maybe something with unsaturation. So, X has two such compounds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but made of two other liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that Y's compounds don't have double bonds anymore. Wait, but waitâ€”could it be that the reaction was hydrogenation, but the problem says it's a disproportionation. Oh right, so it's a disproportionation reaction, which is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced.

Hmm, so X has two liquids that when treated with Pt and heat undergo disproportionation. Since Pt is a catalyst, maybe it's a hydrogenation scenario, but hydrogenation would typically add hydrogen. Wait, but wait, the problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, a hydrocarbon. So, maybe the initial step is hydrogenation, but wait, no, the first step is treating X with Pt and heating, which causes a disproportionation, leading to Y. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they give Z.

Wait, the question says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z, which is a hydrocarbon. And Z is a constituent of Y and is a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. 

So, let's think about possible reactions. X is two compounds that can somehow disproportionate upon treatment with Pt and heat. Since they decolorize bromine, they must have double bonds. So, perhaps X contains alkenes. When they undergo a reaction with Pt, maybe some hydrogenation occurs, but it's a disproportionation, so same element is both oxidized and reduced. 

Wait, maybe one of the reactants is an alkyne. Because, for example, an alkyne (with triple bond) when hydrogenated can become an alkene or an alkane, depending on conditions. Wait, but if it's a disproportionation, maybe it's an example where the triple bond converts into two different products. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an alkene and an alkane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline what's given.

1. X is two equimolar liquids that decolorize bromine. So, each has double bonds (maybe alkenes or even maybe aromatic rings, but since it's a mixture, maybe alkenes).

2. X treated
