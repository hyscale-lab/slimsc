Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what it reacts to when treated with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I think red phosphorus and HI usually do some kind of substitution reaction, maybe like a hydrolysis or elimination?

Let me start by analyzing the spectral data given. The IR shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H or N-H. But the options don't have any amines, so maybe it's an O-H group. Then there are peaks at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions could be aromatic C=C stretching. So this compound likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet and broad. That's a strong downfield shift. Broad singlet could be an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. So if that's the case, the compound could be a benzoic acid derivative. Then, other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like in para-substituted benzene, two doublets. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 in IR could be a carbonyl from a ketone or an ester, but if the compound is a benzoic acid, that would have a carbonyl around 1700 and an -OH. So that fits. Let's see the other NMR peaks. There's a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2CH3. Then at 1.7 ppm, a multiplet of 2H, maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet for 1H, perhaps a CH connected to a branching point. And a doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a methyl group attached to a CH, so maybe like an isopropyl or something.

Putting this together: the aromatic ring has a substituent which is a carbonyl group (from IR). Wait, no, the IR has 1720, which is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. But the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the IR 1720 is from an ester group. Or perhaps a ketone. But the broad peak could be from an -OH, but if the compound isn't an acid, maybe it's an alcohol. But the options don't have many alcohols. Wait, the options are A) propanoic acid, C) benzoic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR again: the 10.5 ppm is broad singlet, probably -COOH. Then, the aromatic protons are para-substituted. The substituent is attached to the ring at the para position. So the substituent is a carbonyl group (like a COOH group) and maybe some alkyl chain.

Looking at the other NMR signals: the triplet at 0.9 ppm, 3H, is probably a terminal CH2CH2 group. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet, maybe a CH2 connected to another CH. The 2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H suggests a CH group. The 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H is a methyl group attached to a CH. So putting that together, perhaps a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something. Wait, maybe a sec-butyl group?

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The substituent on the benzene would be a group like -CO-R, where R is some alkyl chain. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, perhaps it's a benzophenone derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the ring has a -COOH group at position 4 (para) and a sec-butyl group. Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the substituent would be on the benzene ring. Let me imagine the NMR. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), so they are two doublets each integrating to 2H. So this is a para-substituted benzene, with substituents in the para positions. Wait, but the substituent is more than one group? Or perhaps the substituent is a group attached to the ring which itself has branching.

Wait, looking at the substituent: the signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm. Let's see. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH connected to either two CH2 groups or something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps it's a butyl chain. Let me think: the 0.9 triplet (3H) is a CH2CH2 group, so that's the end of a chain. Then the 1.7 ppm is a CH2 connected to
