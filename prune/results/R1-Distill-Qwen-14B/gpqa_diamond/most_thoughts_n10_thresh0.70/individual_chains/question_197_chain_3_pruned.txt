Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I should look at the spectroscopic data to determine the structure of Compound X. Once I know what X is, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's start with the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, probably due to O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) or an alcohol. But wait, the peak is from 3400 to 2500, which is typical for an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid. Also, a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might indicate aromatic ring stretching (C=C vibrations), so there's likely a benzene ring in the compound.

Now the NMR data. Let's list all the peaks and their multiplicities:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet suggests an acidic proton, probably from a carboxylic acid. So, maybe there's a COOH group attached to an aromatic ring.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet with two protons suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring where two protons are adjacent to the substituent.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another aromatic doublet. This could be the other set of protons on the benzene ring, para to the substituent.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet here, maybe a methylene or methine group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Could be part of a side chain.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps another methylene group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of protons, but wait, a doublet. Wait, no, the integral is 3H, so it's a CH3 group attached to a CH2 or a CH. Maybe a methyl group adjacent to a carbon that's next to an oxygen or something.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet (probably due to coupling with two adjacent protons) of 3H, so a terminal methyl group, like a CH2CH2CH3 chain.

Putting the NMR together: The aromatic region (8.0 and 7.2 ppm) suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me think about substituents. The presence of a broad peak at 10.5 ppm pointing to a carboxylic acid group would mean that the substituent is a COOH. So the benzene ring has a COOH group in one position and another substituent in the para position.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which are downfield shifts. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. So the substituents on the benzene are likely electron-withdrawing, like -COOH and another group.

Wait, but let me think again. The aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the benzene has two substituents, each in the para positions, but that would mean a 1,4-dihydroxy structure, but that's not matching here. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another group
