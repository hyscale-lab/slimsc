Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. 

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a molecule with multiple double bonds and branches. I think it's a diene or something similar, maybe a conjugated system because of the double bonds.

Wait, the problem gives me some bond energies. Oh right, bond energies are used to calculate the enthalpy change when bonds are broken or formed. The approach here is to calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (the elements) and then the energy released when the bonds are formed in the product.

The formula I remember is: Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) = [Σ (Bond energies of reactant bonds broken)] - [Σ (Bond energies of product bonds formed)] divided by the number of moles. But wait, no, actually, the formula for calculating enthalpy using bond energies is:

ΔH = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed)

But since enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change for forming one mole of the compound from elements, I need to consider how many bonds are broken and formed in that process.

Wait, the problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 k
