Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about a star with spots and the effect on the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. Let me go through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. So the spots are making the star appear cooler overall.

Now, the key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so when there are no spots, the ratio is compared to when there are spots.

Wait, when there are spots, the Teff decreases. But how does that affect the ionization state of Ti and the ratio of the energy levels?

Oh, right. The star's photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use the Boltzmann equation for the population ratio of two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem mentions the transition wavelength is 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. So that's probably a resonance line, maybe Ti I (neutral Ti) or Ti II (ionized). Since we're talking about neutral atoms, it's Ti I. So the energy levels are in Ti I.

So the energy difference between levels 1 and 2 is E2 - E1 = hc/λ. H is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ the wavelength.

Let me calculate the energy difference. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is about 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 1448e-10 is 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But since E2>E1, E2 - E1 is positive. Let's keep this in eV for easier handling, maybe. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E (in eV) = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. Wait, that seems high. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. Hmm, that's a large energy difference. Wait, but 1448 Å is about 0.1448 nm, which is in the near UV. Ti I lines are around that range? Maybe, but 8 eV seems high because that's like a lot of energy. Maybe I should check the calculation again.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it in terms of wavenumbers, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed, maybe I made a mistake but let's see.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ). Here, k is Boltzmann's constant. Let me compute (E2-E1)/(k*T) for both the original and spotted cases.

Wait, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K.

But wait, wait, the photospheric effective temperature: when spots are present, the overall Teff decreases. But how does that affect the local temperature? Hmm. Wait, the spots themselves are cooler, so the star's surface has both hotter and cooler regions. But when the photosphere is in LTE, each region emits based on its own temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, that's the average, but each spot's temperature is lower than the surrounding. How does this affect the average ratio across the surface? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Because the question says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So maybe the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. So we can model each case as a single temperature.

So in the no spot case
