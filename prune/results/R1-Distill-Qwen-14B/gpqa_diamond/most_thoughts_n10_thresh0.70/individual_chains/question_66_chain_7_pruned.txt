Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are A to D.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant operators constructed from the Standard Model fields. Oh right, because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz symmetric, so any operator in SMEFT has to maintain that symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry must definitely be there. That points to option 1 being correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect all Poincare symmetries. Oh wait, but does that mean the operators have to respect Poincare? I think so because the whole theory is based on local symmetries, which would include Poincare. So option 2 is also a must.

Now, CP symmetry. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. SMEFT is effective, so it doesn't have to preserve any particular symmetry unless the SM does. Wait, no. Wait, the Standard Model doesn't respect CP in general because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So in the SM, operators can violate CP. Therefore, SMEFT would allow operators that violate CP as well. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't necessarily respected by all operators. So operators in SMEFT can break CP, meaning it's not a must for all
