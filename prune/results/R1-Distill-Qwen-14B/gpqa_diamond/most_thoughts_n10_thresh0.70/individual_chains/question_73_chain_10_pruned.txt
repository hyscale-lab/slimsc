Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of the relativistic effects. So for the relative speed, I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, right! The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but I might have it backwards. Oh wait, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)) when u and v are in the same direction. Wait no, in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or wait, wait. The question is about the relative speed of the two astronauts. So astronaut A sees astronaut B moving at v_rel, or vice versa?

Wait, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u is the velocity of the first object as seen from the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the second object as seen from the lab frame. But wait
