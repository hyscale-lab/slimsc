Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I have to use Einstein's theory of relativity because Newtonian mechanics won't work anymore.

So, the first part is about finding the relative speed between them. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. I think the formula for the relative velocity in relativity is different. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, actually, that's for when the two objects are moving in opposite directions. Or is it when they're moving in the same direction?

Wait, no, I think it's for any direction. Let me think. If two objects are moving in the same direction, say along the x-axis, then their relative speed isn't just the difference in their speeds. Because of the way relativity works, the formula must account for the speed of light as a limit.

So, for the relative velocity u between the two astronauts, moving at u1 and u2 in the same direction, the formula is:

u = (u1 - u2) / (1 - (u1*u2)/(c²))

Wait, no, actually, I might have that wrong. Oh right, the formula is (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1*u2)/(c²)), where u1 and u2 are the velocities of the two objects relative to a common frame. So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's velocity?

Wait no, wait. The question is about their relative speed. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Let me plug in the numbers.

So, u would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2)) )
