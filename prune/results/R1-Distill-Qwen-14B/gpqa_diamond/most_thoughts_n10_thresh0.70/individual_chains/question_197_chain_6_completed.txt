Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I should probably analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know X, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH stretch or maybe an amine. But since 1720 cm-1 is present, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) group. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group, like a benzene ring with a ketone, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR now. The 1H NMR has several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 is typical for an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids can also show up around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton if it's an enol form, but that's less likely here.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is probably aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, so maybe in a para-disubstituted benzene ring. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, the protons next to substituents would couple with each other.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, perhaps the ortho protons relative to the substituents. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, one at 1 and another at 4.

Wait, but that would mean the substituents are at 1 and 4. So let's think: substituents in the para positions. Let's say substituent Y is at position 1 and substituent Z is at position 4. Or maybe both substituents are the same, leading to a symmetrical structure.

Then, looking at the other signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH group adjacent to something. Could be a CH next to a carbonyl group, perhaps in a ketone or ester.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe more CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet as a doublet? Wait, actually, it's a triplet if it's coupling with two protons, but the description says d (doublet), which would mean coupling with one proton. Wait, no, wait, the splitting in NMR is determined by neighboring equivalent protons. A doublet of 3H (as a singlet would be if it's a CH3 attached to something that doesn't split it) but here it's a doublet. Hmm, perhaps a methyl group attached to a CH, which is connected to another group. Like (CH2CH(CH3)) or something like that.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, which is typical for a terminal methyl group in an ethyl chain (e.g., -CH2CH2CH3). The triplet arises from coupling with the adjacent CH2 group.

Putting all this together, maybe the structure involves a benzene ring with two substituents, perhaps a carbonyl group and an alkyl chain. Let's think about possible structures.

The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be very strong around 2500-3000, but in the IR data, it's 3400–2500, which might encompass the O-H stretch. Wait, but 1720 is a bit low for a carboxylic acid carbonyl. Carboxylic acids typically have higher wavenumber, around 1700-1725, but sometimes lower if hydrogen bonded. Alternatively, an ester or ketone. But 1720 is a bit high for an ester, which is usually around 1740-1710. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone. Because in that case, the carbonyl would be around 1715 cm-1. So 1720 is plausible. So if the compound is a ketone attached to a benzene ring, perhaps with an ethyl group and some branching.

Looking at the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carbonyl alpha proton? No, that's not right. Wait, the 10.5 peak is a broad singlet, which is more likely an -OH group. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Wait, but then what about the carbonyl? Let me reconsider.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the 1720 cm-1 peak would be the carbonyl. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm is the -OH. The aromatic protons are in the 7-8 ppm range, which makes sense for a para-substituted ring.

Now, what about the other groups? The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's imagine the structure. Maybe something like a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent which is an alkyl chain.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. Like in an isopropyl group. Wait, no, isopropyl would have a CH with two methyl groups attached. Or perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

Let me try to piece this together. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, as in a CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps there's a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, maybe it's a benzyl group with a chain attached. Let's think: the benzene ring has two substituents, one being a COOH group, and the other being an isobutyl group, perhaps.

Wait, let's see: the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would be the end of an ethyl group. So maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a substituent that's an isobutyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. The NMR shows 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So that's two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So substituents at positions 1 and 4.

So benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 4. One is a COOH group, and the other is some alkyl chain.

The substituent at position 1: COOH.

The substituent at position 4: let's see the NMR. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH group. Wait, but let me think about how the substituent would look.

The substituent at 4 could be something like -CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, let me make it clearer. Maybe it's a -CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group. So the substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, let me think about the structure.

The substituent at position 4: let's say it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. No, that might not explain the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that's an ethyl group, which would have a triplet for the end CH3, which it does (the 0.9 ppm triplet). Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the chain. Starting from the benzene ring, we have a substituent that's a chain leading to a terminal methyl group. Let's think about the NMR signals for that.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, but then it's attached to the benzene. Let me try to sketch it.

Suppose the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4 which is a CH group attached to a chain. So the substituent is something like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Wait, but perhaps it's a propyl chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that would just be an ethyl group, which might not explain all the signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group. Let me think about the isobutyl group structure: -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? Or is it -(CH2)2CH(CH3)?

Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

An isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait, no. The structure of isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. The isobutyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. Wait, no. Let me think. The structure of isobutyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)? No, wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3). No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, that can't be right because that would make it a tertiary butyl group, which is actually tert-butyl. Oh wait, no. Wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, no, that would be a neopentyl group. Hmm, maybe I should just draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group (sec-butyl), which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to piece together the NMR data again.

The 2.9 ppm is a m (multiplet) integrating to 1H. So that's a single proton, possibly in a CH group attached to something.

The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could be two protons in a CH2 group.

The 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet) of 3H, which could be a methyl group attached to a CH group. For example, if it's a CH(CH3), then the CH3 would be a doublet if the CH is next to another CH2 group. Or perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to another CH.

Wait, another possibility: The CH(CH3) group is connected to another CH2 group. So the structure would be something like -CH2-CH(CH3)-something. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH, the 1.7 ppm is the adjacent CH2 (maybe the -CH2-), and the 1.4 ppm would be the CH3 attached to the CH.

Wait, but what about the 0.9 ppm (t,3H)? That's a triplet, so that's the end of an ethyl group. So perhaps it's a CH2CH2CH3 group. So putting it all together, the substituent would be something like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, but that's a neopentyl group, which would have a triplet for the CH2 attached to the CH(CH3)2. But the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which would fit a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but that doesn't explain the 0.9 ppm triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let me think: the substituent is -CH2CH2CH3. Then the NMR would show the CH2 groups as a triplet and quartet. But in our data, the 0.9 is a triplet, which matches the end CH3 of a propyl group. The middle CH2 would be a quartet, but in our data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. Maybe that's the middle CH2. Then what about the 2.9 ppm? It would be the CH2 next to the ring, perhaps. Hmm.

Wait, but let's think about the entire structure. If the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4, which is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3), then the substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3. But in that case, the 1.7 ppm would be the middle CH2 (as a quartet), and the 2.9 ppm would be the CH2 attached to the ring (as a triplet). But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which doesn't fit a CH2. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Let's see: The CH2 attached to the ring would have protons that are next to a CH(CH3)2 group. The CH2 group would split into a quartet or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, that's a carbonyl. But the peak is at 1720, which is a bit lower than usual for a carboxylic acid, but possible. Alternatively, it's an ester. Wait, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1740 cm-1, so 1720 might be a ketone or maybe an acid. Let me think.

If it's a ketone, then the structure would have a benzene ring with a ketone group and another substituent. The NMR would have a peak around 2.1 ppm for the ketone's CH3, but in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, perhaps for a CH3 attached to a CH.

Wait, another possibility. What if the substituent is a -COOCH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that's an ester, but then the IR would show the ester carbonyl at higher wavenumbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached via an oxygen, but that seems complicated.

Wait, going back to the IR: The 3400–2500 cm-1 peak is a broad region, which could encompass an O-H stretch. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches, but so do alcohols. But since there's a carbonyl at 1720, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent that's an ethyl group with some branching.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring, and its structure leads to the NMR signals.

The substituent's NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): Maybe a CH group connected to the benzene.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): Two protons, perhaps a CH2 group attached to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): A CH3 attached to the CH group.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): A terminal CH3, part of an ethyl chain.

So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group? No, that can't be right because the CH(CH3) would be at the center.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, but that would be a pentyl group? No, wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that leaves a CH2 group and a CH group.

Wait, let me think in terms of substituent structure.

Suppose the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. But that would be a neopentyl group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH(CH3) group, but that's a sec-propyl group, which is an isobutyl group?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)CH2 group attached to the ring. Then the CH2 groups would have certain splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group, which is an ethyl group. But that doesn't explain the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) and the 2.9 ppm.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Then the CH would have neighboring protons. So the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the two Hs on the CH2CH3. Wait, the CH2 would be split into a quartet, perhaps, but in the data, it's a multiplet. Maybe the structure is more complex.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the possible products when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction to reduce carbonyl groups. Wait, no, I think Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 and heat with a base. Alternatively, HI and red phosphorus are used for the replacement of hydroxyl groups in esters or perhaps for elimination.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a carbonyl group to form an imidazole, but perhaps more commonly, I think that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction called the Cleve elimination. Wait, no, Cleve elimination is for α-hydroxy ketones. Alternatively, perhaps it's a situation where the acid is converted to an acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Another reaction: When a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can form an acyl phosphorane intermediate, which can then be used to prepare various derivatives, but I'm not exactly recalling.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is a substitution. If the compound has a good leaving group, perhaps like a tosylate, but in this case, the compound is reacting with HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. If the compound is an ester, but then reacting with HI and red phosphorus might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a nitrile, but I don't see a peak in the IR that suggests a nitrile (which would be around 2200 cm-1).

Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. For example, if the compound has a protecting group that can be removed under such conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a carbonyl group to form a ylide. For example, in the Wittig reaction. But then, the Wittig reagent is generated, which would react with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. So if Compound X has a carbonyl group, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it would form a Wittig reagent, which would then perhaps eliminate or form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group. Wait, but HI isn't a strong reducing agent. Red phosphorus is sometimes used in reductions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let me think of the possible options and see which structure fits the NMR and IR data, and then see what the reaction would produce.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position and a propanoic acid group attached to the ortho position. Wait, but substituent positions might vary.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzene ring with a sec-butyl group in position 4 and a COOH group in position 1. That would make sense with the NMR data. Let's see:

Benzoic acid would have a COOH group. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6 (if substituents are at 1 and 4). The two protons adjacent to the substituents would be in positions 2 and 6 (for COOH) and 3 and 5 (for the sec-butyl group). So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data.

The substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So the structure would be:

Ph-COOH at position 1 and Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)- at position 4.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, so substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Let's think about the coupling:

The protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and show as a doublet, and those meta to the sec-butyl group (positions 3 and 5) would be another doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets, which matches the data.

Now, what about the NMR signals for the substituent (sec-butyl group):

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

The CH2 group (positioned at 4 on benzene) would have protons that are adjacent to the CH(CH3).

The CH(CH3) would have a proton that is split by adjacent CH2 groups.

So in the NMR:

The CH2 group (attached to benzene) would have two protons, perhaps integrating to 2H. The signal would be around 2.9 ppm? Wait, no, that's the CH. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. The CH2 group is attached to benzene (R-CH2-CH(CH3)-). This would be a -CH2-CH(CH3) group.

The CH2 (attached to benzene) would be next to the CH(CH3). The protons on the CH2 would be a quartet, perhaps, due to coupling with the CH.

The CH group (CH(CH3)) would have one proton, which would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 (which has two protons).

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could correspond to the CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 attached to the ring, which is next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the CH3 attached to the CH, which is a doublet because it's next to the CH (which has one proton, but wait, the CH has one proton, so the CH3 would be a doublet because it's coupled to that one proton). Wait, but in reality, the CH3 is attached to the CH, which has one proton. So the CH3's signal would be a doublet, which matches the 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be a terminal methyl group. But wait, in the substituent we've been considering, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. That doesn't include a terminal methyl. Hmm, so that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the substituent.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then its structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that would be more like a pentyl group. Wait, no, let me correct.

A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene. But that would only have two carbons. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, which is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but that would be a two-carbon substituent, which may not account for the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) signal. Because the substituent we're considering only has a CH3 attached to the CH. So where does the 0.9 ppm come from?

Ah, wait a minute. Maybe the substituent is a longer chain. Let me think differently. Perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:

The structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, which is a two-carbon chain. So, -CH2-CH(CH3)- would be attached to the benzene ring (at position 4). The CH(CH3) group would have one proton, which would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2 group (two protons). The CH2 group would be a quartet, coupling with the CH. The CH3 attached to the CH would be a doublet, since it's only coupled to the one proton on the CH.

So in the NMR, the CH (one proton) would be around 2.9 ppm as a triplet, the CH2 (two protons) around 1.7 ppm as a quartet, and the CH3 (three protons) would be a doublet around 1.4 ppm. But wait, in the data, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (3H), which would correspond to a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain. So this doesn't fit with the substituent being a sec-butyl group. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branching that includes a longer chain. Let me think of option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would be a disubstituted benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 4: a sec-butyl group and a methyl group.

But then, looking at the IR and NMR data, let's think what that would imply.

If the substituents are a sec-butyl group (at 1) and a methyl group (at 4), the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The substituents are both in the para positions, so the aromatic protons would have certain coupling patterns.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data. The COOH group is not present, so the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 would have to be something else. But option D doesn't have a COOH group, so that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, but the IR data has a peak at 1720, which would suggest a carbonyl group. So options without a carbonyl are probably incorrect. So options B and D don't have a carbonyl group; their IR would not show the 1720 cm-1 peak. So they're probably not the correct structures.

That leaves options A and C. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have a propanoic acid group attached to a benzene ring, which has an ethyl group in the para position.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a sec-butyl group in the para position relative to the COOH group.

Let me consider option C first. Structure: benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

The NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons: two doublets (each 2H) at around 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

- The substituent: the CH group (1H) at ~2.9 ppm (m), the CH2 (2H) at ~1.7 ppm (m), and the CH3 (3H) at ~1.4 ppm (d).

But wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So the CH3 is attached to the CH, which is attached to the CH2, which is attached to the benzene.

So the CH3 would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH (which has one proton). So the CH3 would appear as a doublet, perhaps around 1.4 ppm. That matches the data.

The CH group (at 2.9 ppm, 1H) would be a triplet due to coupling with the CH2 (two protons), but in the data, it's a multiplet, which could fit.

The CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H) would be a quartet due to coupling with the CH.

But then where does the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) come from? Because in the substituent, there's only a CH3 attached to the CH, not an ethyl group.

Hmm, that's a problem. So option C doesn't explain the 0.9 ppm triplet. Which suggests that perhaps I'm wrong about the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain. Let me think of option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

In option A, the structure is benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. Wait, I'm not sure about the numbering. Alternatively, it's a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position to the propanoic acid group.

So the substituent at position 4 would be an ethyl group (CH2CH3), and the substituent at position 1 (assuming) would be the propanoic acid group.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the NMR for option A.

The propanoic acid group would have a COOH, which would show a broad peak around 10.5 ppm. The ethyl group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (the CH3), a quartet at 1.7 ppm (the CH2), and a triplet around 2.9 ppm (the CH adjacent to the COOH group). Wait, but the CH2 would actually be between the CH and the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-COOH. But no, that's not option A.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure would be benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4, and a propanoic acid group attached to position 2.

So the substituents are at positions 2 and 4 of the benzene ring. Then the aromatic protons would be in positions 1,3,5,6.

Wait, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Let me clarify: in option A, the substituents are at positions 2 (propanoic acid) and 4 (ethyl). So the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,5,6, and 1?

Hmm, perhaps the aromatic protons would have different coupling patterns. The two substituents are in the ortho and para positions, which could lead to more complex splitting, but I'm not sure.

But looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets. That suggests a para substitution, not ortho and para.

So if the substituents are both in the para positions, then the aromatic protons are split into two sets of doublets.

So option C would have substituents at positions 1 and 4: COOH at 1 and sec-butyl at 4. That would lead to two doublets, each 2H. Which fits the NMR data.

But then the substituent's CH3 (from the sec-butyl) would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and the CH2 (from the sec-butyl) would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). But where does the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) come from? That suggests an ethyl group, which isn't part of the substituent in option C.

So perhaps my initial analysis of the substituent is incorrect, or perhaps the substituent is a longer chain.

Wait, let me think again about the substituent. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a triplet, indicating it's the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH3 group, but that's an ethyl group. But then how does that fit into the structure?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. No, that seems too long.

Wait, another angle. The IR has a carbonyl, so it's either an acid, ester, or ketone. The NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is likely an -OH, so probably a carboxylic acid.

So if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, but that doesn't explain the 0.9 ppm triplet. So perhaps the substituent includes an ethyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but that's a longer chain, but the NMR data doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Then the CH2 would have a triplet, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, could the substituent be a tertiary butyl group? No, that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that would require a longer chain.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of each option's structure and see which fits.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

NMR data:

- Aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Correct for para-substituted.

- COOH: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H).

- Substituent:

   - CH2 (attached to benzene): 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

   - CH (from sec-butyl): 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

   - CH3 (from sec-butyl): 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

But where is the 0.9 ppm (t,3H)? It's not explained by this structure. So perhaps the substituent is a longer chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. No, that's a pentyl group, which would have more protons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isoamyl group (-CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-?), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another possibility: The substituent is a pentyl group, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent includes both a sec-butyl and an ethyl group, but that's not fitting any option.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction part. What happens when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the presence of a carbonyl group to form an acyl phosphorane, which can then undergo various reactions. But another reaction comes to mind: the use of these reagents in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be a substitution where a leaving group is replaced.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can sometimes be used to reduce esters, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction could be the elimination of a molecule. For example, if Compound X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an alkene.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the reaction pathway. Maybe I should think about each option and what would happen when they react with red phosphorus and HI.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Reaction with red phosphorus and HI might convert the propanoic acid into an acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Reaction would be with the acid. Maybe under these conditions, the acid is converted into an acid chloride, but the reagents don't exactly fit for that.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction causes the elimination of CO2, forming a benzene ring with a substituent. For example, if the substituent is a CH2COOH group, elimination could form a double bond.

Wait, but in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So if the substituent was a CH2COOH, elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, but let's think: if the substituent is a CH2COOH group, then reaction with red phosphorus and HI might lead to the elimination of CO2, forming a double bond between the benzene ring and the adjacent carbon. So the substituent would become a CH2 group, perhaps leading to a vinyl group. Alternatively, the substituent could lose CO2 and form a double bond.

Wait, but option C has a sec-butyl group, not a CH2COOH. So that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH group into something else. For example, treating a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus might yield a benzene ring with a CH2 group where the COOH was. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Wait, another approach: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of an acyl phosphorane, which can then undergo various reactions, such as alkylation or elimination.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, perhaps I should think about which option's structure fits the NMR and IR data, and then see what the reaction would produce.

Given that, the NMR data suggests a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent that includes a CH group, a CH2 group, and a terminal CH3 group. But I'm not seeing the fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. For example, a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is a neopentyl group. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then the CH group would have a proton at ~2.9 ppm, the CH2 would have protons around 1.7 ppm, and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, that could fit the data:

- The substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

So substituent structure: benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Then the NMR would show:

- CH group (1H) at ~2.9 ppm (m).

- The adjacent CH2 (2H) would be at ~1.7 ppm (m).

- The terminal CH3 (3H) would be at ~0.9 ppm (t).

This fits all the signals except the 1.4 ppm (d,3H). So this suggests that perhaps there's another CH3 group attached to the CH, making it a -CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3 group. Then the CH would have protons from the CH3 and CH2 groups.

But this is getting a bit too complicated, and I'm not sure if any of the options match this structure.

Another possibility: The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So the substituent is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. Then:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene would be a quartet at 1.7 ppm.

- The CH(CH3) would have one proton at 2.9 ppm (m).

- The next CH2 would have protons around 1.4 ppm as a triplet, but that doesn't fit the data.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to summarize.

Based on the NMR and IR data, the compound is likely a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a CH group, a CH2 group, and a terminal CH3 group. The substituent would produce the signals at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Now, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a sec-butyl group as the substituent. But the substituent's NMR doesn't account for the 0.9 ppm triplet. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain, such as a tertiary-butyl group, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to an ethyl group. But that would require a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which would be a pentyl group with a branch. Then the NMR signals would fit as:

- CH2 attached to benzene: quartet at 1.7 ppm.

- CH(CH3): triplet at 2.9 ppm.

- CH2 next to CH(CH3): triplet at 1.4 ppm.

- Terminal CH3: triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But this doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Then the signals would be:

- CH2 attached to benzene: quartet at 1.7 ppm.

- CH2 next to CH: triplet around 1.4 ppm.

- CH(CH3): triplet around 2.9 ppm.

- Terminal CH3: triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But again, this doesn't match any option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction again. When Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what kind of product is formed?

Assuming that X is a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group. For example, if X is a benzoyl chloride, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by another group. For example, if X is a benzene ring with a COOH and a leaving group, such as a tosylate, the reaction with HI could replace the leaving group with an iodide. But I don't see a leaving group in the structure described by the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. Red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl iodides. The reaction would be: RCOOH + PRed + HI → RCOI + PHO etc.

So if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, the reaction would produce a benzoyl iodide with the same substituent.

But looking at the options, none of them are acyl iodides. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can reduce esters to alcohols, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, another reaction: The use of red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of an ylide, which can then undergo a Wittig reaction. But without an aldehyde or ketone, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts a carboxylic acid into an alkyne. But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options again. Which option, when reacted, would give the correct product.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Reacting with red phosphorus and HI might convert the COOH group into a CH2 group, eliminating CO2. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene (which is option D? No, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So that's not the same.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a xylene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and the reaction eliminates the COOH group, perhaps forming a benzene ring with a CH2 group where the COOH was and the substituent being a sec-butyl group. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group and forms a double bond. So if the substituent is a CH2 group attached to COOH, elimination would form a double bond between the ring and the CH group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group and replaces it with an iodide. So the product would be benzene with a substituent and an iodide group. But none of the options show an iodide.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the benzoic acid into a benzyl iodide. But that doesn't fit the options either.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the reaction part. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The NMR and IR data point towards option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Even though the substituent doesn't fully explain the 0.9 ppm triplet, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, the substituent could have another CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that's not an option. Or perhaps the substituent is a longer chain with an ethyl group attached.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back.

The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction that removes the COOH group, perhaps forming a benzene ring with the substituent. But I'm not sure what the product is.

Wait, another approach: The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to the formation of the corresponding acyl iodide. So if X is a benzoic acid derivative, the product would be an acyl iodide.

But none of the options are acyl iodides. So perhaps the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration. If X has a β-hydroxy group, the reaction could eliminate water to form an alkene. But I don't see a hydroxyl group in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a hydroxyl group, but I don't see an O-H peak in the IR beyond the broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is attributed to the carboxylic acid.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the options and the data, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction that removes the COOH group, perhaps forming a benzene ring with a substituent.

Wait, but the options don't have an acyl iodide. So perhaps the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by an iodide. But that would require the COOH to be a good leaving group, which it isn't under these conditions.

Hmm, I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the data, the structure is option C, and the reaction likely forms an alkene or removes the COOH group. But since the options don't include that, I'll have to go with the best fit.


The problem involves identifying Compound X based on IR and NMR data and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an -OH group), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a strong carbonyl group), and 1610–1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretching). The NMR data includes signals for aromatic protons, a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid), and additional signals for alkyl groups.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure includes a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2. The NMR data does not fully support this structure, as the aromatic splitting pattern and alkyl group signals do not align with the expected pattern for this compound.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carbonyl group, which is inconsistent with the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the NMR data does not match the expected pattern for this compound.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure features a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The IR data aligns with the presence of a carboxylic acid and a carbonyl group. The NMR data also matches well: the aromatic protons appear as two doublets (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm), and the sec-butyl group explains the signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). However, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) signal suggests a terminal methyl group, which is not part of the sec-butyl group. Despite this discrepancy, this option is the most consistent with the data.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carbonyl group, making it inconsistent with the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the NMR data does not match the expected pattern for this compound.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
When Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it likely undergoes a reaction involving the carboxylic acid group. Red phosphorus and HI are known to convert carboxylic acids into acyl iodides or facilitate elimination reactions. However, none of the options explicitly represent an acyl iodide or elimination product. Based on the given options, the reaction likely simplifies the structure by removing the carboxylic acid group, leaving behind a benzene ring with the sec-butyl substituent.

### Conclusion:
The IR and NMR data strongly support **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** as the structure of Compound X. While the reaction mechanism is not fully clear, the product is likely a derivative of this compound after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.
