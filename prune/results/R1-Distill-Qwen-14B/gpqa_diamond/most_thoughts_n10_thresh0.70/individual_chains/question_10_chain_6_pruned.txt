Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see, the options are a to d, and the choices are A to D. Wait, the options are labeled a, b, c, d, but the choices are A, B, etc. So I have to match the correct option letter to the answer.

Alright, the question is asking about the exoplanet with the highest density. So I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh right, density = mass/volume. So each option gives different masses and sometimes mentions radius or composition.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's mass and Earth's radius. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³ because that's what I learned. So this planet would have the same density as Earth. So a's density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if the density is given as 5.5, that's already a specific value. So the question is asking which has the highest density, so if b is 5.5, maybe another option is higher?

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm. So same composition means same density? Because composition affects density—like Earth is made of certain materials, so if another planet has the same mix, its density would be the same as Earth's. Wait, but wait, if it's 5 times more massive, but same composition, then same density. So density would be 5.5, same as Earth. But wait, if it's more massive but same radius? No, because mass and radius are related. Wait, but if the mass increases, but composition is same, the radius would increase because the planet would be bigger. Because volume scales with radius cubed. So mass is proportional to density times volume, which is (density) * (4/3 π r³). So if density is same, mass increases when radius increases. So if the planet is 5 times Earth's mass but same composition, then radius would be larger, like cube root of (5) times Earth's radius
