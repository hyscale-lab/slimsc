Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like radial velocity measurements. 

The question gives me five stars with different parameters. I think I need to figure out which of these stars are bright enough in the V band for both instruments to observe them. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 V mag. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 for HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, actually, because the question says "brighter than" so maybe it's stars with V magnitude <17 for ESPRESSO and <16 for HIRES. Because if a star is brighter, it has a lower magnitude number. So the maximum apparent magnitude they can observe is 17 for ESPRESSO and 16 for HIRES. So the star must have apparent V mag ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. So only stars that are ≤16 mag would be detectable by both.

Wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. So the apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16. Because if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. So the star must be ≤16 V mag to be seen by both. So let's look at each star's apparent V magnitude.

Wait, but some stars don't have their apparent V magnitude given directly. They have absolute magnitude and distance. So I need to calculate apparent magnitude for those.

Star1: absolute V is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. So apparent magnitude m = M +5 log10(d) -5. So 15.5 + 5*log(10) -5. Log(10)=1, so 15.5 +5 -5 =15.5. So m=15.5. Which is below 16, so ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it.

Star2: apparent V mag is 16.5. So that's above 16. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <=17. So only ESPRESSO can detect it. So Star2 is out of the question for being detected by both.

Star3: apparent V mag is given as 15.5. Wait, wait. No, the question says Star3 has an apparent V mag of 15.5, but wait, no: looking back, Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and E(B-V)=0.6. Oh wait, no, the apparent V mag is 15.5? Or is that the absolute? Let me re-read. No, Star3's line says apparent V magnitude of 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, but wait, apparent magnitude is observed, but if there's extinction (interstellar absorption), we have to correct for that. Because the given V magnitude is apparent, but it's affected by extinction. So the observed apparent magnitude would be higher (since extinction makes stars appear dimmer, i.e., higher magnitude). So how do I calculate the intrinsic apparent magnitude without extinction?

Wait, the problem says that the total absorption in the V band is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So total absorption A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude (m) is m = m_true + A_V. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. When a star is observed, the apparent magnitude is m = m_0 + A_V, where m_0 is the magnitude without extinction. Because extinction makes it appear dimmer. So if Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that's after extinction, meaning the true would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. So the uncorrected apparent magnitude is 15.5, but when you correct for extinction, it's 13.64. But wait, the question is about what can be observed. So the apparent magnitude as observed (including extinction) is 15.5. So the instruments detect the observed magnitude. So for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it, since 15.5 is ≤16 and ≤17.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So for ESPRESSO, m <17. So Star3's m=15.5 is okay. For HIRES, m <16. 15.5 is also okay. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Star4: absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10pc. So m = 15.5 +5*1 -5 =15.5. So apparent mag 15.5. But wait, Star4 also has E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the observed m is m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V. So the intrinsic m is 15.5, but with extinction, it's 15.5 +1.24=16.74. Wait, but wait. No, wait: the absolute magnitude is the intrinsic brightness, but apparent magnitude is the observed magnitude, which includes the extinction. So Star4 has an absolute magnitude of 15.5, and is at 10 pc. So its apparent magnitude without extinction would be m=15.5. But considering extinction, the observed m is 15.5 +1.24 =16.74. So the apparent V magnitude is 16.74. So for HIRES, which can only go up to 16, this is above. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <17? No, 16.74 is less than 17? Wait, 16.74 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES can't because 16.74>16. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star5: absolute V mag of 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m = 16.5 +5*(log(5)) -5. Log(5) is about 0.69897. So 5*0.69897≈3.495. So m=16.5 +3.495 -5 =16.5-1.505=14.995, approx 15.0. So apparent mag is 15.0. So both instruments can detect it, because 15.0 is <16 and <17.

Wait, but wait. Star5's data: the question says, Star5: absolute V mag of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc. So m=16.5 +5*(log(5)) -5. Log(5) is approximately 0.69897. 5 * log(5) = approx 3.495. So m =16.5 +3.495 -5 =16.5 + (3.495-5)=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m≈15.0. So apparent V magnitude is 15.0. No extinction is mentioned for Star5, so E(B-V)=0 by default. So yes, apparent mag is 15.0. So both instruments can detect it.

Now, let's go through each star:

Star1: m=15.5. Both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.

Star3: m=15.5. Both can detect.

Star4: m=16.74. HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can detect.

Wait, but wait, the question is which of the following stars can be detected with both spectrographs.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Now, let's look at the options.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected by both. So this is a possibility.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct option is B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait, what about Star1? Star1 has an apparent V mag of 15.5. So ESPRESSO can (m ≤17) and HIRES can (m ≤16). So it's within both.

So why isn't Star1 included in the options? Looking back at the options, the options are between the given pairs. So the options are:

A) 4 and 5 → 4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) 3 and 5 → both can be detected by both.

C) 2 and 3 → 2 can't.

D) 1 and 4 → 4 can't.

So the correct stars are 1,3,5. Which options include any two of these? Only option B is 3 and 5.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m \leq 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m \leq 16 \)). Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude \( m \leq 16 \) to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so HIRES cannot detect it. However, ESPRESSO can detect it since \( m = 16.5 \leq 17 \).

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
     \]  
   - Since the question specifies apparent V magnitudes, the observed magnitude \( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 \) is used.  
   - \( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 > 17 \), so ESPRESSO cannot detect it. However, HIRES can detect it since \( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 > 16 \).

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so HIRES cannot detect it. However, ESPRESSO can detect it since \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 \leq 17 \).

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5(0.69897) - 5 \approx 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

### Conclusion:
- Stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**.  
- Among the options provided, only **Star3 and Star5** satisfy the criteria.

Answer: B
