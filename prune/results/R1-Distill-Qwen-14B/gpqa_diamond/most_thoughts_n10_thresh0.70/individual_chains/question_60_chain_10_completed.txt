Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 Earth years, which is a long time for humans, but these aliens live longer. The astronaut is 22 years old from their own perspective. They're going to Earth, and we need to figure out how long it takes from the astronaut's point of view. The options are whether they die before reaching, or specific numbers like 72, 81, or 77 years.

Hmm. So, the first thing that comes to mind is that this is a problem involving special relativity, particularly time dilation. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to another object. From the perspective of an observer on Earth, time would appear to slow down for the astronaut, but from the astronaut's perspective, it's the Earth that's moving. Wait, but wait—the question is asking for the astronaut's experienced time, so maybe we don't need to calculate the Earth's time, but rather the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Right, proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of the astronaut. So the formula for time dilation is based on the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, wait. Let me make sure I get that correct.

The speed given is 0.99999987c. Wow, that's super close to the speed of light. So v is almost c. Let me compute gamma for this velocity.

First, compute v²/c². v is 0.99999987c, so v squared is (0.99999987)^2 c squared. Let's calculate 0.99999987 squared. Hmm, 0.99999987 is very close to 1. Let me think— (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is very small. So x here is 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2(0.00000013) = 1 - 0.00000026.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because v is 0.99999987c, so v/c is 0.99999987. So squared is approximately (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute it more precisely.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Let me compute this. Let me think in terms of 1 - a small number. Let me denote v = c*(1 - d), where d is a small delta. So d is 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So, v = c*(1 - d), so v² = c²*(1 - 2d + d²). Since d is so small, d squared is negligible, so v² ≈ c² (1 - 2d). So v² / c² ≈ 1 - 2d. Therefore, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - (1 - 2d) = 2d. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2d = 2 * 0.00000013 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is the square root of 0.00000026. Let me compute that. The square root of 0.00000026 is sqrt(2.6e-7) = approximately sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So sqrt(2.6e-7) is about 1.612e-3.5. Wait, 1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4 (since 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001, so 3.16e-4 is about 0.000316). So 1.612 * 0.000316 ≈ 0.000508. So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.000508.

So gamma is 1 / 0.000508 ≈ 1968. So approximately 1968 times the Earth time would be the time experienced by the astronaut? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in time dilation, the Earth time is longer. Wait, no, time dilation works like this: the moving clock (the astronaut) will experience less time than the stationary clock (Earth). So, if from Earth's perspective, the trip takes T years, the astronaut's experienced time would be T / gamma. Wait, no, wait. Wait, remember the formula: proper time (tau) is equal to T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is T divided by gamma. So T is the time measured in Earth's frame, and tau is the time experienced by the astronaut.

But wait, I think I might have messed up earlier. Let me think again. Let me get the formula correct. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is tau = T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if T_earth is the time it takes from Earth's perspective, then the astronaut's time is shorter.

But wait, the problem is asking how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from their own perspective. So we need to compute the proper time, which is T_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But to find T_earth, we need to know the distance.

Wait, but wait. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is something we might need to know. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what the actual distance is, but maybe the problem expects us to assume that the distance is D, and perhaps that we can compute the time in Earth's frame as D divided by v, then multiply by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) to get the astronaut's experienced time.

But wait, wait—the problem states that the astronaut is 22 years old, and the question is how long it takes from their perspective. So perhaps the distance is D, and the time in Earth's frame is T_earth = D/(v), and the astronaut's time is tau = T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But I don't know the actual distance D. Wait, maybe the problem is more about the time experienced, so perhaps it's a question of whether the astronaut lives long enough.

Wait, but the problem says the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22. So if the trip takes, say, 100 years from their perspective, they would reach Earth at 122, which is fine. If it takes longer than 128 (150-22) years, they might die before.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact distance. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance from Earth is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. Wait, that's a lot. So if the spacecraft is going at 0.99999987c, how long would it take from Earth's perspective?

Wait, if the distance is D = 160,000 light-years, and speed is v = 0.99999987c, then the time from Earth's perspective (T_earth) is D / v. So T_earth = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,002.02 ly. Wait, that's the time in years from Earth's perspective.

Wait, wait, no—because 1 ly is the distance light travels in one year. So if the spacecraft is moving at speed v, the time it takes is D / v. So if D is 160,000 ly, then T_earth = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) which is approximately 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.02 years. So T_earth ≈ 160,000 years.

Wait, but that's a very long time. From Earth's perspective, it would take about 160,000 years to reach Earth. But that can't be right because the spaceship is going from the LMC to Earth, but the LMC is in our galaxy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is indeed 160,000 ly. So the time from Earth's frame would be D / v = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.02 ly. Which is approximately 160,000 years.

Wait, but that's an incredibly long time, and the astronaut is only 22. So the astronaut's experienced time would be T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000 * 0.000508 ≈ 81.28 years. Wait, 160,000 * 0.000508 is approximately 81.28 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81 years.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. 22 + 81 is 103, which is less than their average lifetime of 150. So they would live to see Earth.

Wait, but wait—this might not be the correct approach. Let me think again. The time experienced by the astronaut is tau = T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, earlier I thought that T_earth is 160,000 years. But wait, no, because the speed is so close to c, the gamma factor is extremely large.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). We calculated earlier that it's approximately 1968. So if T_earth is 160,000 years, then the astronaut's time would be tau = T_earth / gamma. Because tau = T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = T_earth / gamma.

So tau = 160,000 / 1968 ≈ let's compute that. 1968 * 80 is 157,440. 160,000 - 157,440 is 2,560. 2,560 / 1968 ≈ 1.3. So approximately 81.3 years. So around 81 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years, which is option C. But wait, their current age is 22, so 22 +81 = 103, which is well within their average lifetime of 150. So they would survive.

Wait a minute, but the question says that the average lifetime is 150. So the astronaut is 22, and the trip would take 81 years, so 22+81=103, which is less than 150. So they would not die before reaching. So the answer would be option C, 81 years.

But wait, let me make sure I haven't made a mistake in the calculation. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 )). With v=0.99999987 c, so (v/c)=0.99999987. So 1- (v/c)^2 is 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that more accurately. Because 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x^2. x is 1.3e-7, so x^2 is negligible. So 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2 * 1.3e-7 = 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So gamma = 1/(5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78. So approximately 1961.

Then, T_earth is D/v, which is 160,000 ly / (0.99999987 c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in one year, the time in years is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So tau = T_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 160,000.0208 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 5.1e-4 = 160,000 * 0.00051 = 81.6 years. So approximately 81.6 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81 years. That's option C.

Wait, but wait another thing: the spacecraft is going from the LMC to Earth. So are we assuming that the distance is 160,000 ly? Or is the problem using a different distance? Because sometimes in these problems, the actual distance is 160,000 ly, but perhaps the problem expects you to use the approximate distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to just compute the time experienced without knowing the exact distance, which doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance as the same as our galaxy's diameter, which is about 100,000 ly. But that's just a guess. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance, so perhaps I've missed something. Or perhaps the time is calculated in Earth's frame, and the astronaut's experienced time is a fraction of that.

Wait, but without knowing the distance, how can we compute the time? Hmm, perhaps the problem provides enough information without the exact distance. Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the time using the distance to the LMC, which is about 160,000 ly. So I think my earlier approach was correct.

So, from Earth's perspective, the time is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years. From the astronaut's perspective, it's 160,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈ 160,000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 81.6 years.

So the astronaut would be about 22 +81=103 years old upon arrival, which is within their 150-year lifespan. So they would survive.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is C) 81 years.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the problem uses the concept of length contraction. From the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted. So the distance D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma. So the time from the astronaut's perspective would be D' / v = (D / gamma) / v = D/(gamma v) = (D/(v)) * (1/gamma) = T_earth / gamma. Which is the same as before.

So, yes, the calculation is correct. So the answer is C.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to account for time dilation in special relativity. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is very close to the speed of light. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, \( \tau \)) is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (\( T_{\text{Earth}} \)) by the Lorentz factor:

\[
\tau = T_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For \( v = 0.99999987c \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 1 - 2 \cdot 1.3 \times 10^{-7} = 1 - 2.6 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{5.1 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1961
\]

### Step 2: Time in Earth's frame (\( T_{\text{Earth}} \))
The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth is approximately 160,000 light-years. The time for the spacecraft to travel this distance, as measured in Earth's frame, is:

\[
T_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Proper time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \))
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\tau = T_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,000 \cdot 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Assess the astronaut's survival
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. After traveling for approximately 81 years, their age would be:

\[
22 + 81 = 103 \, \text{years}
\]

Since the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, the astronaut would survive the journey.

### Conclusion
The astronaut experiences approximately **81 years** during the trip, which corresponds to option **C**.
