Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so we're dealing with exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble.

The question says both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each star has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

So, for Planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is the Doppler shift. The RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K, the radial velocity semi-amplitude, is:

K = [ (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) )

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much smaller than the stars (which are sun-like), M_p is negligible compared to M_*. So, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and (1 - e²)^0.5 is close to 1 for circular orbits (e=0). So the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) )

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) ). Wait, no, let me think again. The formula I've seen before is:

K = (v_0) * ( ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(-1/3) ) * (1 / (P (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to start from the basic formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.

The formula is:

K = [ (2 π G) / (c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1 / (P (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the simplified version. Oh right, for circular orbits (e=0) and M_p << M_*, this simplifies.

The simplified form is K = ( (2 π G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(1/3) P^(
