Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let's see. The setup is that there's a magnetic field initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how the spin states evolve when the magnetic field changes direction. Let me think. Spin-1/2 particles have their magnetic moments influenced by the magnetic field. The energy levels are determined by the interaction between the magnetic moment and the field.

Initially, the field is along +Z, so the magnetic moment mu is aligned with it. The spin state is probably in the eigenstate of Sz, which is the spin in the z-direction. So the state is |+z> or |−z> depending on the alignment. Since mu is along +Z, I think the state is |+z>.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off, the particle's state doesn't change instantaneously. But wait, actually, the magnetic field is turned off and then another one is turned on along +Y. So the system's Hamiltonian changes. Initially, the Hamiltonian was H = -mu·B, but now it's H = -mu'·B', with B' along Y.

Wait, maybe I should write the Hamiltonian more precisely. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz. So the initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma Sz B in the z-direction. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero for an instant, but then the field in the Y direction is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma S_y B.

Wait, no, I think I might be getting this wrong. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is mu · B. So the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. So when the field is along Z, H = -gamma S_z B. Then, the field is turned off (so H becomes zero?), and then turned on along Y, so H becomes -gamma S_y B, because the field is along Y now.

Wait, but if the field is turned off and then another one is turned on, the system goes from H_initial to H_final without an intermediate zero. Or maybe the process is sudden, so the state doesn't change but the Hamiltonian changes. So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, and then the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y.
