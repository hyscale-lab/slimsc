Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? So, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes it's just approximately equal to some constant. Wait, no, actually, the exact form is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But for estimation purposes, maybe we can just use Δx * Δp ≈ ħ, to simplify.

The problem states that the electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Hmm, so first, let me get the data straight. The electron's speed v is 2e8 m/s. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so this speed is about two-thirds the speed of light. That's pretty fast, but electrons do move at significant fractions of the speed of light sometimes.

The position uncertainty Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh, I should convert that into meters. 0.1 nanometers is 1e-10 meters, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m.

So, I think the first step is to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Because the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates Δx and Δp. So, using Δx * Δp ≈ ħ, I can solve for Δp.

Wait, what's the value of ħ? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So, ħ is h/(2π), which is roughly 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But for estimation purposes, maybe I can approximate it as 1e-34 J·s.

So, Δp ≈ ħ / Δx. Let me plug in the numbers.

ħ is approximately 1e-34 J·s, and Δx is 1e-10 m. So Δp ≈ (1e-34) / (1e-10) = 1e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me double-check the units. Planck's constant in J·s, and Δx in meters, so yeah, when you divide J·s by meters, you get kg·m/s, which is the unit of momentum. So that's correct.

So Δp ≈ 1e-24 kg·m/s.

But wait, now I need to find the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. So, how to relate Δp to ΔE.

Well, if the electron has a momentum p, then its kinetic energy K is p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So, the uncertainty in energy would be the uncertainty in p squared over twice the mass.

Wait, but maybe since we are dealing with uncertainties, I should think in terms of differentials. So, the energy E is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be approximately (dE/dp) * Δp.

The derivative dE/dp is (2p)/(2m) = p/m. So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but wait, that would be the case if E is proportional to p squared. So, substituting,
