Okay, so I have this physics problem about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB has a certain energy and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I need to find at what gamma-ray energy their lifetimes are limited by this process. 

Wait, right, the process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. So, the gamma-ray is high energy, and the CMB photon is low energy. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. 

I think this is a problem about photon-photon interactions. The gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by how quickly it can annihilate with CMB photons. So, the lifetime would be determined by the inverse of the annihilation rate. 

The annihilation rate probably depends on the cross-section for the reaction and the number density of the CMB photons. The cross-section for this process might be a known formula, or I might need to derive it. 

I recall that the cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair has a certain dependence on the energy. Oh wait, the threshold energy for this reaction is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. So the minimum energy for each photon would be when the sum equals 2 m_e c². But in this case, the CMB photon is fixed at 1e-3 eV, so the gamma-ray photon's energy must be above a certain threshold.

Wait, but the question isn't about the threshold; it's about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process. So maybe we're looking for the energy where the annihilation rate becomes significant enough that the gamma-ray doesn't survive much longer than the age of the universe or something like that.

The formula for the annihilation rate (Γ) is probably given by the product of the cross-section (σ) and the photon density (n). Since the gamma-ray is moving through a bath of CMB photons, each time it has a chance to interact. 

The cross-section for two photons producing an electron-positron pair might be given by the Klein-Nishina formula or some other photon-photon cross-section. Wait, but in the high-energy limit, for γγ → e+e-, the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (8π/3) * ( (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_γ E_cm) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the cross-section for pair production by two photons is σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2), where E1 and E2 are the photon energies. But I need to confirm this.

Wait, actually, the cross-section for γγ → e+e- is given by σ = (8π/3) (m_e^4)/(E1 E2) when E1 and E2 are much larger than m_e c², but wait, no, perhaps. Wait another approach: In
