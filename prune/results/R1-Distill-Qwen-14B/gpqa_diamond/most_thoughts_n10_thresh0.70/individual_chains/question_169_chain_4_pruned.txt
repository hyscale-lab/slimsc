Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear decay, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's see. The question is about how the energy spectrum of particles changes when the decay process varies.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. And it's given that the E particles have a continuous spectrum with an endpoint Q. So E's energy can vary up to Q.

Now, in the variant, instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. I need to compare the E energy spectrum in this new scenario.

Wait, I remember that in beta decay, for example, the electrons have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves the conservation of momentum and energy, with the neutrino carrying away some energy. The endpoint is determined by the maximum possible energy when all the energy goes into the electron (but that's only if there's a massless neutrino, I think).

In the original decay, 2E and 2V are produced. So V must be some kind of particle, maybe a neutrino-like particle? Or perhaps another boson. Since E's have a continuous spectrum, it suggests that they share energy with V, similar to how electrons and neutrinos share energy in beta decay.

In the original case, each E can have a range of energies up to Q because the Vs carry away some energy. So the E's maximum energy is Q when the V's take none. But since there are two Vs, the energy is split, so each E can't reach Q alone.

In the variant, the decay emits one M instead of two Vs. M is massless. So the decay equation is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Now, M is massless, so it's like a photon or a neutrino. So in this case, how does the energy of E change?

Wait, the original case had two Vs, so four particles in total. Now, it's two E's and one M, making three particles. So the system's dynamics are different.

In the original decay, the two E's and two V's would each carry away some energy. Now, with only one M, which is massless, the energy distribution would be different. Since M is massless, it must carry away momentum but no rest mass energy. So the energy partition between E's and M would affect their spectra.

In beta decay, when a nucleus emits an electron and a neutrino, the electron has a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy. The maximum energy of the electron is when the neutrino takes as little as possible (probably zero, but in reality, it can't be zero because neutrinos have mass, but assuming M is massless, so maybe M can take zero energy? Wait no
