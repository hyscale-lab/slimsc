Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with mice. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The question says that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, during in vivo imaging, some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid and some get stuck in the intestinal mucus. But then they look at the Peyer patches and isolate proliferating cells. Sequencing their variable heavy chain genes shows high variability. 

Wait, what's happening here. So, Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're like little patches on the intestinal wall that help sample the gut contents for immune surveillance. So when the rotavirus proteins are delivered via oral gavage, they might be taken up by these Peyer patches. 

The GFP is used to track where these proteins go. But some are destroyed by stomach acid or stuck in mucus. So maybe only a portion make it through. But those that do reach the secondary lymphoid organs, which I think are like the Peyer patches, are then processed. 

The question mentions isolating the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in lymphoid tissues are probably B cells that are responding to an antigen. So the rotavirus proteins are acting as antigens here. When B cells encounter an antigen, they get activated, start proliferating, and then differentiate into plasma cells or memory cells. 

The sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes shows high variability. That makes me think about how B cell receptors are generated. B cells have diversity in their BCRs due to processes like VDJ recombination, which happens during their development in the bone marrow. But wait, there's also somatic hypermutation, which occurs after activation. 

Wait, VDJ recombination is the initial process during B cell development that creates the diversity in the heavy chain by joining variable, diversity, and joining gene segments. But this process is during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow, before they even encounter an antigen. So if the B cells are already in the Peyer patches, they've gone through that, so their receptors are already variable. 

But the question says that after immunization (or in this case, exposure), the variable regions are highly variable. Oh wait, but they're looking at the variable heavy chain after the cells have been activated. Maybe they're seeing the result of further diversification. 

Somatic hypermutation occurs after the B cell is activated. It introduces more mutations into the variable region of the BCR, increasing the diversity of the immune response. This allows for a more precise targeting of the antigen. So the high variability they're seeing in the variable heavy chains is likely due to this process. 

The other options: complement activation is about the classical pathway, not directly related to B cell diversity. Class switching is about changing the type of antibody isotype, like from IgM to IgG, but that's not about the variable regions' variability. 

So the process happening here is somatic hypermutation. So the answer should be A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence from these proteins is observed to be partially destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, but some reach the Peyer patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer patches are isolated, and the proliferating cell population is analyzed. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

Peyer patches are specialized structures in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue that sample antigens from the intestinal contents. When the rotavirus proteins are taken up by these patches, they act as antigens, activating B cells. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the proliferating cells suggests a process that diversifies the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. 

During B cell development, the initial diversity of the heavy chain is generated through VDJ recombination, which occurs in the bone marrow before antigen exposure. However, the question describes a scenario after antigen exposure, where further diversification is observed. This points to somatic hypermutation, a process that introduces additional mutations into the variable region of the BCR after B cell activation, increasing the diversity of the immune response.

Other options, such as complement activation and class switching recombination, are unrelated to the observed variability in the variable heavy chain. Complement activation involves the classical pathway of the complement system, and class switching recombination changes the antibody isotype but does not affect the variability of the variable region.

Thus, the process responsible for the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
