Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think this through step by step. Okay, the problem gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, I think it's actually L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, right, because the fermion fields ψ are being multiplied by X(y), which is the boson field.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible fermion-antifermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, the decay products must have enough energy to create the particles. So for each possible fermion, I need to check if their mass is less than half of X's mass, which is 6 GeV. So m_fermion < 3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of the standard model fermions? Let me recall. Let me list them:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV (~0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (~0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.28 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

So looking at these, any fermion whose mass is less than 3 GeV can be produced as a decay product of X. So let's see which fermions fit that.

Electron: yes, way below 3 GeV.

Muon: yes.

Tau: 1.78 GeV, also yes.

Up quark: yes.

Down quark: yes.

Strange quark: 0.095 GeV, yes.

Charm quark: 1.28 GeV, yes.

Bottom quark: 4.7 GeV. That's above 3 GeV, so no. So X can't decay into b and bbar, because 2*4.7 GeV is 9.4 GeV, which is much larger than X's 6 GeV mass. So the decay X → b b̄ is not allowed.

Top quark is out of the question since its mass is way above 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−. Wait, includes b which we said isn't allowed. So A is not correct.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−. So includes c which is allowed (1.28 GeV). So all the fermions in B have m <3 GeV. So B looks possible.

Option C: includes t which is way too heavy, so C is out.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy. So D is out.

So between the options, only B and maybe another. Wait, let me check what the Lagrangian says about which fermions can interact.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so the interaction term is proportional to ψ̄ (v + X) ψ, which suggests that it's a Yukawa coupling. The Yukawa interaction term is usually of the form g ψ̄ ψ X, so in this case, the coupling is λ f. So, the subscript 'f' on λ probably indicates that this coupling is for a specific fermion species.

Wait, does this mean that the boson X only interacts with that particular fermion? Or is 'f' a general index? Hmm, perhaps the notation is that 'f' runs over all possible fermions. But the way the Lagrangian is written may imply that X couples to all fermions, because the term is present for each fermion. But the question is about which fermions are kinematically allowed, regardless of the strength of the coupling.

Wait, but the question is about the allowed decays. The allowed decays only depend on the mass and kinematics. So regardless of whether the coupling exists, the question is which fermions have mass less than 3 GeV. Because the coupling strength λ determines the decay rate, but not whether the decay is kinematically allowed.

Wait, but no. If the coupling doesn't exist for a particular fermion, then that decay isn't possible. So the couplings have to be considered as well.

So the key is to find which fermions have both m_f < 3 GeV and that the coupling exists for X to those fermions.

Looking at the Lagrangian again. The term is λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ. Wait, perhaps the 'f' in λ f is the fermion flavor index. So each fermion has a coupling λ_f. But without knowing which fermions have non-zero λ_f, how can I proceed? Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify any particular fermions, so I think we can assume that X couples to all possible fermions, given that the Lagrangian is written in that form.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So X can interact with any fermion ψ_f, with coupling λ_f. But for the decay X → f f̄, the coupling must be non-zero. So if a fermion's coupling is zero, X cannot decay into it.

But the problem doesn't give any specifics on which fermions have non-zero λ_f. So I think we have to assume that X can interact with any fermion, as the Lagrangian includes a general term for ψ_f. Therefore, we can proceed under the assumption that X can decay into any fermion that satisfies the mass condition.

But wait, in reality, the Yukawa coupling's existence depends on the particle content of the theory. For example, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to all fermions except perhaps neutrinos, depending on whether they are Majorana or Dirac. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify any such limitations, so perhaps we can assume that X couples to all possible fermions, regardless of their mass.

So, if X can couple to any fermion, then the only limitation is the mass condition. So as I thought earlier, any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV is allowed.

So looking back, the fermions that meet this are
