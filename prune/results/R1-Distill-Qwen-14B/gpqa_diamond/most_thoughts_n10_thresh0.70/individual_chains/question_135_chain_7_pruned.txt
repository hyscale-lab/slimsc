Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term and the mass of the boson. I remember that the decay of a particle is determined by the conservation laws and the available energy, which is related to the mass of the particle.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf(y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I might be getting that wrong. Oh right, the interaction term probably involves the fermion fields and the boson X. So this must be a Yukawa interaction because it looks similar to the Yukawa coupling term, which is something like L = -g ψ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. But which fermions can it decay into? I think the key here is the mass of the fermion. The energy released when X decays must be enough to create the fermion pair.

Each fermion has a certain mass. Let me list the fermion masses I remember. The top quark is the heaviest, around 173 GeV, so way heavier than 6 GeV. The bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV, I think. Then charm is about 1.5 GeV. The strange quark is lighter, maybe around 100 MeV. Up and down quarks are even lighter, like 2-5 MeV. Then the charged leptons: electrons are negligible, muons about 0.1 GeV, tau around 1.77 GeV. Neutrinos are super light, but probably not relevant here.

So, for X to decay into a fermion pair, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because each fermion in the pair contributes their mass, and since they're a pair, it's twice the mass. So for a fermion f, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, let me think again. No, actually, for a boson (like X) to decay into a pair of particles, the energy (mass of X) must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. So in this case, X is a boson with mass 6 GeV. The decay products are a fermion and its antiparticle, each with mass m. So 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Looking at the fermion masses:

- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV → way below 3 GeV.
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV → also fine.
- Tau: ~1.77 GeV → 1.77 * 2 is ~3.54 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait, no, wait. No, 1.77 GeV per tau, so two taus would be 3.54 GeV. But X's mass is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.54 GeV. So tau can be a decay product.

Wait, no, wait— the X's mass is 6 GeV, so the maximum possible mass for each fermion is 3 GeV. Because each ferm
