Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let's try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes show specific features. But wait, this peak at 790 nmâ€”what's that about? Oh right, in the rest frame, maybe that's a particular emission line. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is around 121 nm, but that's in the UV. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman break or something else. Oh, wait, another thought: when quasars emit light, if we observe it in the near-infrared, it might be because of redshift. So the peak we see is actually redshifted from its original wavelength.

Wait, the peak is 790 nm. Let me think: visible light is about 400-700 nm, so 790 is near infrared. So if the quasar emitted this peak at a shorter wavelength, perhaps in the optical or UV, and it's shifted into the infrared, that suggests a significant redshift. But how do I find the redshift from this?

I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission
