Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out what the concentration of the acetic acid is after dilution. Since we're adding equal volumes, the concentration should be halved, right? Because concentration is moles divided by volume, and if you double the volume, concentration halves.

So the initial moles of acetic acid are volume (L) times molarity. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, 0.05/2 is 0.025, so that's correct.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration: Hmm, 25% of what? Probably 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to find out how much NaOH is added at 25% of the equivalence point.

The equivalence point volume is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Acetic acid has 0.001 moles (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001, and since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³.

So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, that's 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH neutralized, producing the same amount of acetate ions.

So after reaction, the remaining moles of acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate produced: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume now is original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, to find pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D has 4.57, which is higher. So this suggests that the pH at 25% is around 4.26.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let's recalculate the moles.

Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.02 L * 0.05 = 0.001 mol. Adding 20 cm³ water makes 40 cm³. So diluted concentration is 0.025 M.

At equivalence point, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (because 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 mol, same as acetic acid).

25% of that is 2.5 cm³ NaOH, which is 0.0025 L * 0.1 M =
