Okay, so I've got this question about Klinefelter's syndrome and why its symptoms are less severe than Down's syndrome. Hmm, I remember that Klinefelter is when a boy has an extra X chromosome, so it's XXY instead of the usual XY. Down's is when there's an extra whole chromosome 21, so trisomy 21. 

The question is about the molecular mechanism that makes Klinefelter's have less severe phenotypic consequences. I'm trying to think about why that would be the case. Maybe it has to do with how the extra chromosomes are handled during meiosis or cell division.

Wait, during meiosis, for Down's, it's a trisomy which comes from a nondisjunction event, right? So the extra chromosome doesn't get separated properly. But in Klinefelter's, the extra X is usually an extra in the sex chromosomes. Oh wait, wait. Klinefelter's is typically due to a nondisjunction in the father's sperm, which gives XXY. So each cell has an extra X, but in a diploid cell, that's two Xs and one Y.

But how does that affect the phenotype? Well, in females, having an extra X (like in Turner's syndrome) is actually more problematic, but for males, it's less severe. Wait, but Klinefelter's is XXY, so that's two X's and a Y. So the X's are probably in pairs. 

Wait, in females, they have two X's
