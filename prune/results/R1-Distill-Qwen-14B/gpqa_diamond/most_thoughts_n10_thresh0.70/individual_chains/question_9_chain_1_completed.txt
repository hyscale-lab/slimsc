Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let's think it through.

First, what's C3h symmetry? From what I remember, symmetry in molecules involves different types like Cn, Dn, Td, Oh, Ih, and others. C3h is one of the axial point groups. Point group symmetry describes all the symmetry operations that leave the molecule looking the same. C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane that includes the axis (σh). So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation about that axis, and there should be a mirror plane that includes the axis.

Wait, no, actually, wait. C3h is a point group where the molecule has a threefold axis and also a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees around this axis, and it would look the same, plus there's a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis. Or wait, is it including the axis? I think the h in σh denotes a horizontal mirror, which is perpendicular to the rotation axis.

So, each of the options is a different molecule. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Triphenylene is a tricyclic system, maybe with three benzene rings connected in some way. The 'trifuran' part suggests three furan rings attached. The numbering might indicate the positions. I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but if it's a triphenylene core with substituents, perhaps it's symmetrical.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Again, a benzo-fused structure with trifuran. Wait, benzo rings fused with furans? Maybe it's a structure where three furan rings are connected in a way that they form a bridge or a fused system. The numbering might be a bit tricky, but symmetry-wise, perhaps this has some mirror planes or rotational axes.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate is a borane with three isopropyl groups attached to the boron atom. So, the structure would be B with three isopropyl (CH(CH3)2) groups. Wait, no, wait. Triisopropyl borate is actually (i-Pr)3BO. Is that correct? So, the boron is at the center with three isopropyl groups. The isopropyl groups have two methyl groups attached to a CH2, but wait, the isopropyl group is CH(CH3)2. So, each substituent is identical, each is the same isopropyl group. So, if all three groups are the same, the molecule might have some symmetry.

What's the symmetry of triisopropyl borate? B has three identical substituents. So, the structure is trigonal planar around B. Wait, but actually, in reality, boron in such compounds is tetrahedral. Oh wait, no, triisopropyl borate is (iPr)3BO? Or perhaps it's a trigonal planar arrangement? Wait, no, I think the borate would have a trigonal planar structure with the three isopropyl groups in the plane. But wait, if all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically around the central atom, then the molecule would have a high degree of symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: the structure is (CH(CH3)2)3B(O-) maybe? Or perhaps it's a neutral molecule, but regardless, the point is the symmetry. So, with three identical groups arranged symmetrically around the central atom, this molecule should have a C3v symmetry or maybe C3h? Hmm, wait. C3v is a different point group. Let me recall: C3v has a threefold rotation axis and three vertical mirror planes. So, if the molecule has three identical substituents around a central atom, it would have a C3v symmetry, not C3h. Because the mirror planes (if any) are vertical, not horizontal.

Wait, but if it's a planar structure, like a flat triangle, then perhaps the mirror planes would include the rotation axis. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think: C3h has a horizontal mirror plane, which would pass through the central atom and be perpendicular to the rotation axis. So if the molecule has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror, then it would be C3h.

But triisopropyl borate's structure: the boron is in the center, with three isopropyl groups. Are they arranged in a trigonal planar geometry? That would imply they're in the same plane. So, imagine three identical substituents arranged in a triangle around the central atom. Then, the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees around the central axis (say, the B atom), and it looks the same. Also, if there's a mirror plane that's horizontal, passing through the boron and each substituent, then that would imply that each substituent is symmetrical across that plane.

Wait, but the isopropyl groups themselves have a plane of symmetry. Each isopropyl group (CH(CH3)2) is symmetrical. So, if the molecule has a threefold axis, and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. Alternatively, if the mirror planes are vertical (i.e., perpendicular to the threefold axis), then it's C3v.

Wait, another approach: The point group of a molecule with three identical substituents around a central atom is C3v. Because each substituent is the same, and the molecule has three vertical mirror planes. So, in that case, it would have C3v symmetry, not C3h. So triisopropyl borate would have C3v symmetry, not C3h. So if that's the case, then option C is not the correct answer.

Moving on to option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a bridgehead amine. Its structure is like two cyclohexane rings bridged together, making a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system, with a nitrogen atom in one of the bridgeheads. So, structure-wise, it's a cage-like structure, with a bridgehead nitrogen. Now, what's the symmetry of quinuclidine?

Quinuclidine has a three-dimensional structure. I think it has a C3 symmetry axis. Wait, let me think. The molecule has a central nitrogen, and three bridges extending from it. Each bridge is two carbons long, I believe. So, each of the three bridges is equivalent. So, the molecule could have a threefold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen at one bridgehead. So, the molecule has a threefold axis because of the three identical bridges. Each of the three positions around the nitrogen are equivalent. So, rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But what about a mirror plane?

I think quinuclidine has a C3 point group, which is a threefold rotation without any mirror planes. Because the molecule is chiral. Wait, no, is quinuclidine chiral? I thought it's actually achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure: imagine a central nitrogen connected to three bridge systems. Each bridge is a two-carbon chain. So, the molecule looks kind of like a three-legged stool. If you look from the top, you might see a trigonal planar arrangement. Now, for symmetry, does it have a mirror plane? If you take a mirror plane that includes the threefold rotation axis, then it would have C3h symmetry. Otherwise, it's just C3.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about quinuclidine's symmetry. Let me think again. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. Its structure is symmetric. I think it has a C3h symmetry. Because, when you look at the molecule, it's symmetric across the threefold axis and has a mirror plane that includes that axis. So, if you imagine a plane cutting through the nitrogen and two opposite positions, that would be a mirror plane. So, the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees, and also reflected in that plane, making the symmetry C3h.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another approach: The point group of quinuclidine is Td. No, wait, no, Td is tetrahedral, which is a different structure. Quinuclidine is more of a three-dimensional cage. Wait, what's the actual point group?

I think I need to recall the symmetry of quinuclidine. It has a threefold rotation axis and a mirror plane that includes this axis, making it C3h. So, it would have both a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but another thought: if quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the molecule has three bridges, each with two carbons. So, each of the three bridges is same. So, when you look along the threefold axis (imagine looking through the molecule along the axis perpendicular to the plane), the molecule has three equivalent positions around the axis. So, rotating 120 degrees would bring the molecule into itself. Also, if there's a mirror plane along that axis, then it would have a C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the mirror planes are vertical (perpendicular to the threefold axis), then it would be C3v. But I'm pretty sure quinuclidine has a C3h symmetry because of the mirror plane that includes the rotation axis.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let's think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The name suggests a benzo-fused system with three furan rings. The numbering implies how the rings are connected. So, perhaps it's a structure where three furan rings are fused to a benzene ring in a way that creates a symmetrical molecule.

Wait, if it's a benzo-fused system with three furans, perhaps it's a tricyclic system. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, then it's possible to have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, another approach: look for the presence of a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Benzo[...]trifuran... hexaone. The hexaone implies six ketone groups? No, that's not right. Wait, the hexaone is the numbering, probably with six substituents. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a tricyclic structure with three ketone groups in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical. Maybe it's a symmetric arrangement of substituents around a central point, leading to C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually cubane, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let me go back. The point is, the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, which of these options has both a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Option D is quinuclidine, which I think has a C3h symmetry.

Option C, triisopropyl borate, I think has C3v symmetry because the mirror planes are vertical, not horizontal.

Option A: Triphenyleno[...]trifuran... So, a triphenylene core with three furan rings attached. Triphenylene is a tricyclic system with three benzene rings. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps this molecule has a higher symmetry. But does it have a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, maybe the correct molecule is option B, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of symmetry elements. C3h has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, let's think about each option.

Quinuclidine: I think it has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. So that's option D.

Triisopropyl borate: has a threefold axis but the mirror planes are vertical (each through a substituent), so C3v symmetry. So not C3h.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran... could have a threefold axis if the three substituents are arranged symmetrically. Suppose the core is a benzene ring with three substituents attached in a symmetric fashion, each at 120 degrees apart. That would give a threefold axis. Also, if there's a mirror plane that includes the rotation axis, then it would have C3h.

Wait, but in benzo-fused systems, the substitution pattern can influence the symmetry. If the three furan rings are attached symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has C3h symmetry.

But I'm not as confident about that as I am about quinuclidine.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Triphenyleno[...]trifuran... Maybe the triphenylene part is a tricyclic system, and the three furan rings are attached symmetrically, leading to a threefold axis and a mirror plane.

Wait, triphenylene is a [2.2.2]paracyclophane, made of three benzene rings connected in a triangular fashion. So, the molecule would have a threefold rotation axis, and perhaps a mirror plane through each pair of rings.

If the substituents (the furan rings) are attached symmetrically, perhaps the entire structure has C3h symmetry.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about the actual structures.

Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran would imply that the three furan rings are fused to the benzene in a way that each is attached at positions that are 120 degrees apart. So, perhaps the benzene ring is connected to three furan rings in a symmetric fashion, leading to a threefold axis and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to coronene, but that's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options except D (quinuclidine) is correct, as I'm more confident about its symmetry.

Wait, another approach: the molecule with C3h symmetry would have a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, looking for a molecule that can be rotated 120 degrees and also reflected over a plane that includes the rotation axis.

Quinuclidine, I think, has a threefold axis and such a mirror plane, so it would be C3h.

Triisopropyl borate, as I thought earlier, has a threefold axis but vertical mirror planes, making it C3v.

Options A and B: I'm less certain, but perhaps the benzo[...]trifuran could have a threefold axis. Let's imagine it's a central benzene ring with three substituents attached at 120-degree positions. If those substituents are symmetric, the molecule would have a threefold axis.

But if the substituents are furan rings or something else, their own symmetry would influence the overall symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is the correct answer. Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Let's parse the name. The base is a benzene ring fused with three furan rings, each at positions that create a threefold symmetry. The hexaone suggests six ketone groups, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, the numbering could indicate the positions of substituents.

Wait, the name is "benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone." So, the structure is a benzene ring fused to three furan rings in a way that each furan is attached to the benzene at positions that are 120 degrees apart. So, the benzene would have three substituents (furan rings) each at adjacent positions, leading to a symmetric structure.

In such a case, the molecule would have a threefold rotation axis. And, if there's a mirror plane that includes the axis, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a threefold axis and multiple mirror planes, but the key is whether it has a horizontal mirror plane.

But I'm not entirely sure about this one.

Hmm. Quinuclidine's symmetry is what I'm more confident about. So, if D is quinuclidine and it has C3h symmetry, then D is the correct answer.

Wait, let me think again about quinuclidine. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen at one bridgehead. The molecule is symmetric. If you look down the threefold axis (perpendicular to the nitrogen and the opposite bridgehead), the three bridges are identical and arranged symmetrically. So, a threefold rotation would leave the molecule unchanged.

Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Imagine cutting the molecule through the nitrogen and one of the opposite bridgeheads. Would the two halves be mirror images? If so, then a mirror plane exists, making the symmetry C3h.

Alternatively, if the mirror plane is vertical (i.e., perpendicular to the threefold axis), then it's C3v. But in quinuclidine's case, I think the mirror plane would include the threefold axis, making it a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So, the point group would be C3h.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry elements of each option. **C₃h** symmetry consists of a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that includes the rotation axis. The molecule must look identical after a 120° rotation about the axis and must also be symmetric with respect to the horizontal mirror plane.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a triphenylene core fused with three furan rings. The triphenylene structure itself is symmetric, with three benzene rings arranged in a triangular fashion. However, the fusion with the furan rings does not clearly introduce a threefold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. The symmetry is likely lower than **C₃h**, so this option is unlikely to be correct.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a benzene ring fused with three furan rings in a symmetric arrangement. The numbering suggests that the furan rings are attached to the benzene ring at positions 120° apart, which could imply a threefold rotation axis. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is unclear. While the molecule may have some symmetry, it does not definitively exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
Triisopropyl borate is a molecule with a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The trigonal planar arrangement of the substituents around the boron atom introduces a threefold rotation axis (C₃). However, the symmetry is likely **C₃v**, as the molecule has three vertical mirror planes perpendicular to the threefold axis, rather than a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, this molecule does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen atom at one bridgehead. The molecule has a threefold rotation axis due to the symmetric arrangement of the three bridges. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane that includes the threefold axis, making the symmetry **C₃h**. This matches the required symmetry for the question.

### Conclusion  
After analyzing all options, **quinuclidine** (Option D) is the only molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry.  

**Answer: D**
