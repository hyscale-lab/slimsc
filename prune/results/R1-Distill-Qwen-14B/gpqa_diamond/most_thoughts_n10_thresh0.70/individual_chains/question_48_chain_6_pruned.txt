Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group attached.

The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine. I think bromine usually does some kind of addition or substitution. Wait, since cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, maybe it's an enolate formation? Or is it a diene? No, wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a bromination via the enol intermediate. Or perhaps it's a conjugate addition? Hmm, wait, ketones can undergo addition reactions with bromine under certain conditions.

Oh wait, maybe it's the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. But wait, adding bromine to a ketone... I think that would involve the cyclic bromonium ion formation. So cyclohexanone would react with bromine to form a dibromide. Wait, no, that's more like an addition of HBr, but with Br2, maybe it's a different mechanism. Oh, wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogenation via the enol. Oh, right! The Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that's for carboxylic acids. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility:
