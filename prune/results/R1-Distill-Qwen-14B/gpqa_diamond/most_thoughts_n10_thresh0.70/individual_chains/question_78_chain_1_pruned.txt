Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the potentials due to a moving charge. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). We're looking at the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at some time t, given that t is greater than tr, which is the time when the field was generated.

Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. The potentials are related to these fields. For a stationary charge, the scalar potential is straightforward—V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity and the need to account for magnetic effects too.

Wait, right, the vector potential A is primarily associated with the magnetic field. For a moving charge, the magnetic field is given by Ampère's law, but since this is a point charge, maybe we can use the Liénard potentials or something like that.

So, the general form for the potentials when a charge is moving. I think the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just 1/(4πε₀ r) times q anymore. There's a term involving the velocity of the charge. Oh, right, there's a term that corrects for the motion. Something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (something), and that something involves the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [gamma (1 + (v·r̂)/c²)] / r, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe it's (q/(4πε₀)) [gamma (1 ± (v·r)/(c² r))]/r, depending on the sign conventions.

But looking at the options, all the options for V are in terms of either 1/r, or something with d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr), I think. Because s(tr) is where the charge was at time tr.

Wait, the problem says d is the vector from the field generating point (charge's position at tr) to the field point r. So d = r - s(tr). Or maybe it's s(tr) to r, so d is r - s(tr).

But let's think about the expressions. The options C and D have terms like d c ± (d·v). Hmm, wait, the denominator is something like (d c ± (d · v)).

Wait, let me get back. The potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. For the scalar potential, the static case is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, there's a correction due to the motion. Similarly, the vector potential comes into play.

I recall that the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential at a point r is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ (v × r̂) / r ] or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, I remember that for the potentials due to a moving charge, the potentials can be written in terms of the scalar and vector potentials that include terms from the charge's velocity.

Wait, let me think in terms of the retarded potentials. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) ∫ [ (1/r') ] δ(t - t_r - (r' - r)/c ) d³r', but maybe that's getting too into the derivation.

Alternatively, perhaps the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's velocity at the retarded time. The scalar potential would involve a term that includes the velocity, but I'm a bit confused about the exact form.

Looking at the options, let's analyze each one.

Option A: V is just the static potential, and A is (v²/c²) V. Hmm, but vector potential should involve the velocity, not the square of velocity. Also, V is just the static term, which might not account for the motion's effect correctly. I'm not sure about this one.

Option B: V is static, A is (v/c²) V. Hmm, that's interesting because A is proportional to v, which makes sense since A is linked to the magnetic field, which arises from moving charges. But does the scalar potential stay static? I'm not certain. But I think for a moving charge, the scalar potential isn't just 1/r anymore; it has a correction term.

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - (d · v))). Hmm, so d is a vector, and d·v is the dot product. Let's see, the denominator is d c minus the dot product. Wait, that would be c d - (d·v). Wait, but d is a vector, so how does that work? Or maybe it's (d c - (d·v)) as in scalar terms, like d is a scalar distance? Wait, no, because d is a vector. Oh wait, perhaps the expression is more like [d · (c - v)] or something else. Hmm, not sure. But the denominator would have to be in terms of a scalar, so maybe it's written as (d c - (d · v)).

Wait, but d is a vector, so c is a scalar. So d c is a vector, and (d·v) is a scalar. Wait,
