Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see what I remember about that. Radial velocity detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is, the bigger the shift, I think.

The question says two stars have the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets based on the measured Doppler shifts.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I remember that the Doppler shift (or velocity semi-amplitude) is related to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/1) )? Wait, no, maybe I should think about the simplified version since the star's mass is much larger than the planet's. So M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So the formula for the semi-amplitude K is approximately K = [ (G * M_p ) / (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * sqrt(1 - e²)) ) )

But since both planets are in circular orbits, e=0, so that term is 1. So K = [ (G * M_p ) / (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P ) )^(1/1) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, since I'm trying to think without that, perhaps I can recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3} )) ), but that might not be precise.

Alternatively, another approach: the Doppler shift (K) is directly related to the velocity of the star in its orbit. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the dependence of K on the orbital period and the mass of the planet. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, the main variables here are the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

Wait, but the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both. Similarly, M_star is the same for both. So when I compare K1 (for planet 1) and K2 (for planet 2), the ratio K1/K2 should be proportional to (1/P1)^(1/3) / (1/P2)^(1/3) )? Or wait, perhaps K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period? Let me think.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c^3 P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should be more precise. The correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P) ) ) / (c) )

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (2π)) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that (P^2) = (4π² G)⁻¹ * ( (M_star + M_p ) * a^3 ), where a is the semi-major axis. But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So P² ≈ (4π² G)^-1 * M_star * a³

Rearranging, a³ = G M_star P² / (4 π² )

But the radial velocity method depends on the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity is v = (2π a)/(P) ), where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, a ≈ (M_p/(M_star)) * a_p, where a_p is the planet's semi-major axis.

Wait, no, the star's orbit's semi-major axis is a = (M_p/(M_star + M_p )) * a_p ≈ (M_p/M_star) * a_p, since M_p << M_star.

So v = 2π a / P = 2π (M_p a_p / (M_star P)) )

But from Kepler's third law, a_p^3 = G (M_star + M_p) P² / (4 π² ) ≈ G M_star P² / (4 π² )

So a_p ≈ [ G M_star P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting back into v, we get:

v = (2 π M_p / M_star ) * [ G M_star P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) / P

Simplify the terms:

Let's compute [ G M_star P² ]^(1/3 ) = (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(2/3 )

So the expression becomes:

v = (2 π M_p / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) P ) )

Simplify the denominator: (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = (4)^(1/3) π^(2/3 )

Putting it all together:

v = (2 π M_p / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / ( (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) P )

Combine the terms:

The 2 π in the numerator and 4^(1/3) π^(2/3) in the denominator can be simplified. Let me compute 2 π / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) )

4^(1/3) is cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.5874, but perhaps we can keep it as 2^(2/3) since 4=2². So 4^(1/3)=2^(2/3).

π / π^(2/3) = π^(1 - 2/3) = π^(1/3).

So 2 π / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3) )) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) * π^(1 - 2/3 ) = 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3 ) = (2 π )^(1/3 )

So putting it back:

v = [ (2 π )^(1/3 ) * M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) ] * [ G^(1/3) P^(2/3 - 1) ]

Wait, P is in the denominator as P^1, and the P^(2/3) is in the numerator. So overall, P^(2/3 - 1) )= P^(-1/3) )= 1/P^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the exponents correctly.

Let me reorganize:

v = [ (2 π )^(1/3 ) ] * [ M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) ] * [ G^(1/3) ) ] * [ P^(-1/3) ]

Wait, because from earlier steps:

v = (2 π M_p / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) P )

Which simplifies to v = (2 π ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) * ( M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) * (G^(1/3) ) * ( P^(2/3) ) / P

Which is:

v = (2 π ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ) * ( M_p G^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( P^(-1/3) )

So 2 / 4^(1/3 ) is 2 / (2^(2/3)) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3 ) )= 2^(1/3 )

And π / π^ (2/3 )= π^(1/3 )

So the first fraction becomes 2^(1/3 ) * π^(1/3 ) = (2 π )^(1/3 )

So overall, v = (2 π )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/3 ) * M_p / M_star^(2/3 ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

So, putting it all together:

v = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/ P^(1/3) )

But wait, 2 π G is in the numerator, so (2 π G)^(1/3) is a factor.

So, K (the semi-amplitude) is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since both planets have the same M_p and M_star is the same for both stars, the ratio K1 / K2 = (1 / (P1^(1/3) )) / (1/(P2^(1/3) )) ) = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Rearranging, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 / P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait, let me write that again.

Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), so K ~ 1 / P^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (K1/K2 ) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (K1/K2 )^3 = P2 / P1

So P2 = (K1/K2 )^3 * P1

Wait, but K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, which is 5 milliangstroms, and K2 is 7 milliangstroms.

So K1 =5, K2=7.

So (K1/K2 ) =5/7 ≈0.7143

So (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143 )^3 ≈ 0.364

So P2 = 0.364 * P1

Which means P2 is about 0.36 times P1, so P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is shorter, so the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1.

So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check. Because the question asks, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

Which is P2 / P1.

From earlier, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )^3

K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So (5/7)^3 = (5)^3/(7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1. So it's shorter, not longer. So the answer is approximately 0.36 times, so the period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times longer than planet 1? No, wait. If P2 is shorter, then P2 is 0.36 times P1, which means it's shorter by that factor. So if the question is how much longer is P2 than P1, the answer is approximately 0.36, meaning it's shorter. So the correct option is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the formula. Because the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So K is larger when the period is smaller.

Planet #2 has a larger K (7 milliang) than planet #1 (5). So since K2 > K1, the period P2 must be smaller than P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1, it's about 0.36, so planet #2's period is about 0.36 times planet #1's period.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be 0.36 times, meaning P2 is shorter, so the factor is 0.36.

So the answer is option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since both planets have the same mass and orbit stars of the same mass, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143
\]

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = (0.7143)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \) is approximately \( 0.364 \) times \( P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
