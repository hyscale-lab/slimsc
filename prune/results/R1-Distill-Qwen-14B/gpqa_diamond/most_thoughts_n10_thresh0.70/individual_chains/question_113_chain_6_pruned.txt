Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see... The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down each piece of information one by one. First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around this region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, maybe the compound has an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other strong absorptions are at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But the 1650 peak could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds or something else). Wait, aromatic rings usually have peaks around 1500-1600, so 1650 might be something else.

Wait, but there's a very broad peak at 3000. If it's O-H, that suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and around 2500-3300. Also, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid would be around 1700, but maybe a bit lower, like 1680-1720. But the presence of two peaks: 1700 and 1650. Maybe one is a carbonyl, and the other is something else. Alternatively, maybe 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is conjugated double bonds, like in an aromatic ring or in a conjugated carbonyl system, but wait, if it's a ring, that's usually around 1600. Hmm, perhaps the 1650 is an amide or another type of carbonyl? Or maybe a conjugated ester or something.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond. Also, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the molecule has a structure like CH2=CH- something. So the compound must have a double bond, which could be either isolated or conjugated.

Putting this together: the molecule has a carbonyl group (1700 cm-1), a possible O-H group (broad peak), and a double bond (vinyl H's in NMR). Let me think about functional groups. If there's a carbonyl and a double bond, maybe it's an ester with a double bond, or maybe a ketone with a double bond. But wait, the presence of an O-H suggests that maybe it's a carboxylic acid
