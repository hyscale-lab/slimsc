Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are all different C6HxOy compounds, so I'll need to analyze each piece of data to narrow it down.

First, looking at the FTIR data. The very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups, probably from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a broad peak around that region is typical for either alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe a ketone? No, wait, ketones have strong C=O around 1700. The broad peak at 3000 is more likely from O-H, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is even broader and usually appears around 2500-3300 as a very broad peak. So if it's very broad, that could support a carboxylic acid. But then again, maybe it's an alcohol. But since the IR also has peaks at 1700 and 1650, which are typical for carbonyl groups. So maybe it's an ester or something with an ester group, which has a carbonyl around 1700-1750. The 1650 peak might be from another carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching in an aromatic compound, but 1650 is a bit lower than typical for aromatic C=C which is usually around 1450-1600). Wait, but 1700 is a strong peak, which is probably a carbonyl, maybe an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. 1650 could be another carbonyl, like maybe an conjugated carbonyl or an acid. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group somewhere. So maybe a conjugated system, like a carbonyl next to an alkene.
