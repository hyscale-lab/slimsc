Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The scientist made a calibration curve by using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in a series and ran qPCR on each, with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Wait, the slope in a qPCR curve usually relates to efficiency. Oh right, the formula is slope = log10(e) / ln(e) or something like that. But wait, if the efficiency is 100%, the calculation for the slope can be a bit different. I remember that the ideal slope for a perfect 100% efficient qPCR is -3.3219, which is approximately -3.3. So here, the slope is -3.3, which fits that. And R² is 1, so the data perfectly fit the curve. So the calibration seems good.

The Ct values are given for each concentration. Looking at the data:

At 100,000 copies: Ct values 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. Average is maybe around 34.2? 

At 10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average about 31.

At 1,000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. So average 27.6.

At 100: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Around 24.3.

At 10: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Around 21.

Wait, each tenfold dilution (100,000 to 10,000 is a tenfold decrease) leads to an increase in Ct of about 3.6. Wait, 33.9 to 30.6 is a decrease of about 3.3. Wait, let me compute that. 33.9 minus 30.6 is 3.3.
