Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different formulas. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

First, let's visualize the setup. There's a conducting sphere with radius R, and it's grounded. That means it's connected to the earth, so any excess charge can flow in or out. Oh wait, but wait—if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges on it would stay on the sphere? Or can they flow away? I think when an external charge is near a grounded conductor, the conductor can lose or gain electrons from the ground to maintain neutrality, except for the induced charges.

Wait, no. The sphere is conducting, so when a charge q is placed near it, the charges in the conductor (which is neutral to start with) will redistribute. But since it's grounded, electrons can move freely. So when I bring a positive charge near the sphere, the electrons in the sphere will be attracted towards the near side, leaving the far side positively polarized. Because it's grounded, the sphere can actually transfer charges to or from the ground to maintain a certain condition. Hmm, wait a second—no, wait. No, the sphere is a conductor, so when a charge is placed outside, the conductor's charges will rearrange. Since it's grounded, the conductor is at zero potential. Or does being grounded just mean that any excess charge can leave?

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. But when you place a charge q outside, the sphere will have an induced charge. But because it's grounded, the induced charge won't stay on the sphere—wait, no, wait again. If the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges can leave. Wait, no, no. Let me think: when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the charges in the conductor rearrange. Since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will cause the sphere to have a dipole or something, but if it's grounded, the conductor can lose or gain electrons to maintain the potential at zero. Wait,
