Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential, because it's quadratic in r. So this is like a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator. The problem asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be derived by considering each of the three directions (x, y, z) as independent 1D harmonic oscillators. The total energy would then be the sum of the energies in each direction.

The energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). But wait, in 3D, each level is specified by three quantum numbers: nx, ny, nz. The total energy would be E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ℏω. 

So the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. For example, the ground state has nx=ny=nz=0, so the total energy is (0+0+0 +3/2)ℏω = (3/2)ℏω. The first excited state would be when one of the quantum numbers is 1, so the energy would be (1+0+0 +3/2)ℏω = (5/2)ℏω. Wait, but no, wait: no, wait, the ground state is (3/2), then each step increases by 1ℏω. Or wait, no: the sum (nx + ny + nz) is the "principal" quantum number in a way. Each time this sum increases by one, the energy increases by ℏω.

So the ground state is (3/2)ℏω. The first excited state is when the sum is 1, so 1 + 3/2 = 5/2. Second excited is sum=2 → 7/2. Third excited, sum=3 → 9/2. Wait, but wait, no: the excited states are ordered based on the energy, which is determined by the sum. So the third excited state would have a sum of 3, because the ground is 0, first is 1, second is 2, third is 3. So the energy is (3 + 3/2)ℏω = (9/2)ℏω. So that's the first part of the answer: energy is (9/2)ℏω.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. That is, the degeneracy of the energy level. Degeneracy refers to how many distinct quantum states share the same energy.

In 3D, the degeneracy occurs when the sum (nx + ny + nz) is fixed. For the third excited state, the sum is 3. How many ways can 3 be expressed as the sum of three non-negative integers (nx, ny, nz)?

This is a combinatorial problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to nx + ny + nz = 3. The formula for this is (n + k - 1 choose k -1), where n is the sum and k is the number of variables. Here, n=3, k=3. So (3 +3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 possible combinations. Each combination corresponds to a different set of quantum numbers, and thus a different eigenfunction. Therefore, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2)ℏω and 10, which matches both pieces. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option B has an energy term with π² and 1/(m r²), which doesn't make sense because the energy for the harmonic oscillator should be proportional to ℏω, not involve r in the denominator. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C has the correct energy but the number of functions as 3, which is wrong because it's 10. Option D has the same issue as B with the energy term, and the number is 3, so wrong.

So the correct answer must be option A.


The problem involves a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given as \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of such a system are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) associated with the three spatial dimensions. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The energy levels depend on the sum \( n_x + n_y + n_z \), which increases by 1 for each excited state. 

For the third excited state, the sum \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). Substituting this into the energy formula, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the energy level corresponds to the number of ways the sum \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \) can be achieved with non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Number of solutions} = \binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1},
\]

where \( n = 3 \) (the sum) and \( k = 3 \) (the number of variables). Substituting, we find:

\[
\text{Number of solutions} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** correctly states the energy as \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and the degeneracy as 10.
- **Option B** has an incorrect energy term involving \( \pi^2 \) and \( r^2 \), which is not relevant to the harmonic oscillator energy.
- **Option C** has the correct energy but incorrectly states the degeneracy as 3 instead of 10.
- **Option D** has the same issue as B with the energy term and also incorrectly states the degeneracy as 3.

The correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
