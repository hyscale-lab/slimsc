Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. But wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal exactly? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter a? I think so. Because in a cubic system, the interatomic distance would be a, but since this is rhombohedral, the edges are all a.

So the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cos α) ) ), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Oh wait, I'm mixing things up. For a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula for d_hkl is a bit different.

Wait, I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is d = (a)/(sqrt( (h² +k²+l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos α )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l
