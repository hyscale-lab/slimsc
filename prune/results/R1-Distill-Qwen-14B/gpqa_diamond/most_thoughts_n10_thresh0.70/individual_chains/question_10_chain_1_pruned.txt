Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. The question gives four options, each describing different exoplanets. I need to figure out which one has the highest density.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this planet should have the same density as Earth. I'll note that down as 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. Wait a second. The density is already given here. So if the density is 5.5, same as Earth, but mass is double. Oh, but wait, density is mass over volume. If mass increases but density stays the same, then volume must have increased as well. So this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth. So this would be similar to Earth's density. So a and b have the same density?

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, composition matters. Same composition as Earth implies same density, right? Because density depends on the material it's made of. So if it's 5 times Earth's mass but same composition, the density would still be Earth's density, 5.5. But wait, no—wait. If the mass increases, but the composition is same, then the radius must be larger. Let me think. Since density is mass/volume, and volume is proportional to radius cubed. So if mass increases by 5 times, and density remains same, the radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. But wait, the question is about density. So option c's density is same as Earth, so 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So again, same density as Earth, 5.5. Because composition affects density. So the density is same as Earth.

Wait a second, but that can't be right because not all options have the same density. Oh wait, let me recheck.

Wait, the options a, c, d all have same composition as Earth, which would
