Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex from its constituent ions. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2−n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached. The stability constants would correspond to the different complexes. But wait, the order of βs here is β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because β4 is lower than β3. Maybe they're for different n? Like, β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. But wait, how many complexes are there? The β values are for four different complexes. Oh, perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)^n(II) for n=1 to 4? But the β values don't seem in increasing order. Hmm, but maybe the complexes are different, like some with different structures, but I think in this problem, each β corresponds to a different n.

Wait, the problem refers to the 'blue dithiocyanato' complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So we're being asked about the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is probably the blue one. So we need to find the fraction of Co that's in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

But wait, the stability constants might be for different orders. So for each complex, the β is given. Let me list them:

n=1: β1=9 → [Co(SCN)]^+ 

n=2: β2=40 → [Co(SC
