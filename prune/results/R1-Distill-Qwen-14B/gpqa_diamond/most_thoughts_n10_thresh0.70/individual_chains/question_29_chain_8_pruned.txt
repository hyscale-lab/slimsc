Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley and a gene mutation that affects an anti-nutritional compound. Let's see what I can figure out step by step.

The question says that the intact gene has a specific DNA sequence, and each mutant has a change in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think that's about disrupting the gene's function.

Wait, the gene is responsible for synthesizing the compound, right? So if the gene doesn't work, the compound won't be made. So we're looking for a mutation that likely disrupts the gene function, maybe through a premature stop codon or something that changes the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences, the first exon is at the beginning. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene to spot the changes.

Intact gene starts with:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, the first part. Let's see. The intact has TTTCTCGC. Mutant 1 has TTCTACGC. Wait, so the sequence changes in the middle. Let me count the letters. Intact: positions 4-10 maybe? Or wait, let's see:

Looking at the first part, the intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT... So the mutant 1 is ATG T TCT ACG. Wait, maybe I should compare each position.

Wait, perhaps the easiest way is to look for changes that cause a frameshift or a premature stop, or an amino acid change that disrupts function.

Wait, all the options are point mutations, I think. Because each has a change in a specific spot.

Wait, looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: First change is at position... Let's see. The intact gene's first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So comparing:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGG...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGG...

Wait, so the third codon in the first exon: maybe. Let's break it down. Let me write the codons.

Intact gene first few codons:

ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant1: ATG, TTT? Wait, wait, let me align.

Wait, the first few nucleotides: Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT...

Mutant1 is ATG T TCT ACG C... Wait, maybe
