Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about two reactions, A and B, and I need to select the major products from the given options.

First, let's look at reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure to visualize better. So, benzene ring with a substituent that's an oxy group attached to a methyl group and another group. Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the benzene has a CH2-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group attached? Or wait, maybe it's (CH2-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2) attached to benzene. No, wait, the actual structure is benzene with a group like O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Let me parse that.

The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but wait, positions. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH, no, wait, but I think I'm getting it wrong. Wait, the correct structure for but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is actually CH2-CH2-CH=CH, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the numbering for but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2-. But but-2-en-1-yl would be the substituent starting at the first carbon, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, but that's longer than but. Wait, but but is four carbons. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-
