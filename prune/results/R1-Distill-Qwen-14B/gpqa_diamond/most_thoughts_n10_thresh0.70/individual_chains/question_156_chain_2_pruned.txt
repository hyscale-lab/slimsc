Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performs two reactions. Both involve treating different enenes with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The question is about what the chromatograms will show.

First, I need to recall what mCPBA does. Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions are important here. Are these epoxidations happening with any specific stereochemistry?

Wait, the problem says each reaction is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA and then aqueous acid. So after epoxidation, what happens? Oh right, the epoxide can undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening. But wait, under what conditions? The acid work-up usually leads to the formation of diols, I think. Because the epoxide ring opens in acidic conditions with water as the nucleophile.

Wait, but wait a second. mCPBA-induced epoxidation is an electrocyclic reaction, which forms the epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration. Because for alkenes, the geometry (E or Z) affects the epoxide's structure.

Let me think. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA, which is a peracid that causes epoxidation via a concerted mechanism, leading to a trans-dihydroxylation, but wait, actually, the epoxide formation is syn addition. Wait, no, peracids add across the double bond in a syn fashion. So the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, let me clarify. For (E)-oct-
