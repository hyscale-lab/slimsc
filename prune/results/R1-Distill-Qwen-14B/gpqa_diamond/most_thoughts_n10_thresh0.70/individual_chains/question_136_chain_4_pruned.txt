Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the vector field f(r) is described as having a magnitude of 1/r² and only a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, this would mean f(r) has components only in the r-direction, and the other components (theta and phi) are zero. So f(r) = (F_r, 0, 0), where F_r = 1/r². Right.

The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So, mathematically, I need to compute ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of the sphere.

Wait, I remember that divergence in spherical coordinates is a bit different from Cartesian. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² F_r) + ... for the other terms, but since our vector field has only the radial component, those other terms (the ones involving 1/sin(theta) derivatives of the theta component, and the phi component) are zero. So for this case, ∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

Let me plug F_r into that. F_r is 1/r², so r² F_r is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Which means ∇ · f = 0.

Wait, that would imply that the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, right? Because when r is zero, this might be a problem, but since we're integrating over a volume including r=0, perhaps it's a point where the field isn't defined, like a singularity. Hmm.

Wait, wait. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere should be zero, because in the regions where the divergence exists (r > 0), it's zero. But wait, what about the origin? Because the origin is a point, which has zero volume, but the field might have a delta function there.

Wait, this reminds me of Gauss's Law in electromagnetism. The divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, where rho is charge density. If E behaves like 1/r², then the
