Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime is τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, τ2 = 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but when considering the energy difference between E2 and E1, say ΔE = E2 - E1, the corresponding uncertainty in time would be the time over which we measure the energy. Or wait, perhaps the uncertainty in time is the time during which the transition between the states happens, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the uncertainty in energy arises from the time during which the system is in a certain state. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each state has an inherent uncertainty in energy due to its own lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ΔE_i ≈ ħ / τ_i. So for E1, the uncertainty would be ΔE1 =
