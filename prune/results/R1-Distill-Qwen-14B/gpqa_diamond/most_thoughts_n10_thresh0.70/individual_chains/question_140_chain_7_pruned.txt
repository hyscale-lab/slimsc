Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so if the number of neutrons equals protons, that means the molecule is probably composed of elements with that property. Wait, but W is a gas, so maybe it's something like H2O or CO2? No, wait, those don't fit the neutron and proton count. Let me think. Another thought: maybe a molecule composed of elements where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, deuterium is H with a neutron, but maybe that's not it. Wait, if the molecule itself has equal protons and neutrons. Let's see, H2O: H has 1 proton, O has 8. So molecule has 2 H (2 protons) and 8 (O). So total protons 10, neutrons for O is 8, but wait, the molecule's total neutrons would be 8 (from O) plus 2*(0 from H), so 8. So protons 2+8=10, neutrons 8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CH4? No, that's a gas but let me check. C has 6 protons, H has 1 each. CH4 has 6 +4 =10 pro
