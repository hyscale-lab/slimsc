Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So, B must be a solid at room temperature, but just barely. 

I remember that melting points around that range... Wait, water freezes at 273 K, which is 0°C. So 277 K is a bit higher, like 4°C. Hmm, what solid melts around there? Maybe something like ice, but that's 273 K. Alternatively, maybe something else. Wait, maybe B is something like sodium hydroxide? No, that's a higher melting point. Could it be something like ammonium chloride? Not sure.

Wait, the precipitate G when heated releases B. So G is a compound that decomposes upon heating to give B. Let's think about decomposition reactions. For example, when some metal hydroxides are heated, they might decompose into metal oxide and water. Or maybe carbonate decomposes into CO2 and the metal oxide.

Wait, the gas W is formed when X reacts with Y. W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecule's protons and neutrons are equal. Let's think of possible gases like that. Common gases: H2O, NH3, CO2, CH4...

Wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me calculate for possible molecules.

Take H2O: H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each H2O molecule has 2*(1) + 8 = 10 protons. Neutrons would be 2*(0) + 8 =8. So 10 and 8? Not same.

Wait, maybe ammonia NH
