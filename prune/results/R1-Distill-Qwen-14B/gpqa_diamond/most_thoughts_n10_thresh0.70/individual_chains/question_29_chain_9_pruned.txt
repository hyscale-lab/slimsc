Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it through again and understand what's going on.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. So, they found the gene responsible for making that compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they sequenced the target gene in all the mutants. The changes were found in the first exon area. We need to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, the options are mutants 1 to 4, and the answer is one of them. The question is about which mutation would most probably inactivate the gene responsible for the compound. So, probably a mutation that disrupts the gene function, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Let me look at the sequences provided.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, each line is the same except for a few differences. Let me compare each mutant to the intact sequence.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compare to intact:
Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, in the first part, the intact is ...TTTCTC... and mutant 1 is ...TTCTAC...
Wait, looking more carefully:

Looking at the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT GGC …

Wait, perhaps the differences are at positions where the nucleotides change. Let me line them up.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, let's split each into parts.

Intact starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the difference is in the third codon. Intact has TTTCTC, mutant has TTC TAC.

Wait, perhaps counting the nucleotides:

In the intact gene, the first few nucleotides are:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mut
