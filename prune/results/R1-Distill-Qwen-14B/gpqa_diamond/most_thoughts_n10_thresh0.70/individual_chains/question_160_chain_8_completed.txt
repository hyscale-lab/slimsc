Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis and falls vertically on this aperture. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can use the tanθ = θ approximation.

The options are A to D, involving λ/a multiplied by some constants.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think this is a diffraction problem. When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark fringes. The shape of the aperture affects the diffraction pattern — I remember that a circular aperture gives the classic Airy disk with a central maximum surrounded by rings of minima and maxima.

But here, the aperture is an N-sided polygon. And N is infinitely large. Oh wait, when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, because a polygon with infinite sides would approximate a circle. So I'm thinking that as N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture.

If that's the case, then the minima for a circular aperture (Airy disk) occur at certain angles. The first minimum is at an angle θ given by the condition that the path difference between the light rays from the edge of the aperture leads to destructive interference.

Wait, the formula for the minima in a single-slit (or circular) diffraction is based on the concept of the path difference. For a single slit of width 'a', the minima occur when a·sinθ = m·λ, where m is an integer, except for the case of a circular aperture where it's a bit different because the geometry is two-dimensional.

Wait, no. For a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. But for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a different set of conditions. Specifically, the minima (the dark rings) in the Airy pattern occur when the phase difference between the light from the edge of the aperture and the central point leads to destructive interference. The condition for the minima in the Airy pattern is given by a·sinθ = 1.22λ for the first minimum.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get this right. The first minimum in the Airy pattern occurs at approximately θ = 1.22 λ/(π a), or something like that. Because I remember the formula for the first minimum is when a sinθ = 1.22λ. So θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

But wait, the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. If the first minimum is at θ1 and the second at θ2, then the angular separation would be θ2 - θ1.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the minima in the Airy pattern are not equally spaced. The first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/a. The second minimum is at θ2 ≈ 2.46 λ/a, if I recall correctly. So the angular separation between them would be about 1.22 λ/a. Because 2.46 minus 1.22 is approximately 1.24, but wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, let me think again. The Airy pattern's minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function J1 is an integer multiple of π. The condition is J1(a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 occurs at a sinθ = π * (1.22019...), so that's where the first minimum is. The next zero is at about 2.46, so the next minimum is at a sinθ = 2.46λ. So the first minimum is at θ1 = (1.22019... λ)/a, and the second is at θ2 = (2.46 λ)/a. So the angular separation between them is θ2 - θ1 = (2.46 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.24 λ/a.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, wait, no, that's the separation between the first and second minima. So if the first is at 1.22, the second at 2.46, the separation is about 1.24, which is approximately 1.22. Hmm, but the options don't have 1.24.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0.610 λ/a

B) 0.500 λ/a

C) 1.220 λ/a

D) 0.506 λ/a

Hmm. So 1.22 is option C. But the separation between first two minima is about 1.24, which is approximately 1.22, perhaps. But wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the minima are determined by the circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

Wait, but wait, another thought: maybe the question is not about a circular aperture but about a different shape because the polygon is regular. But for N approaching infinity, it's a circle, so the analysis holds.

Wait, but the problem says the apothems are of the same length a. Hmm, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon with N sides, each of length s, the apothem is a = (s)/(2 tan(π/N)). But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius approaching a, because as N increases, the apothem a approaches the radius.

Wait, no. Wait, when N is the number of sides, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, which for a regular polygon is the same as the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon, the radius R is related to the apothem a as R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So as N becomes very large, the radius of the polygon approaches a. Therefore, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) as a = R * cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a approaches R. So the radius of the polygon approaches a as N increases.

So if the apothem is a, and as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. Therefore, the problem reduces to a circular aperture of radius a.

So, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at a sinθ = 1.22 λ. So θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first is at θ1 and the second at θ2, the separation is θ2 - θ1.

As I thought earlier, the first minimum is at θ1=1.22 λ/a, and the second minimum (the next one) is at θ2=2.46 λ/a. So the angular separation is approximately 1.24 λ/a. But none of the options say 1.24. The closest is option C which is 1.220, but that's just the angle for the first minimum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the scenario. Maybe the problem is not about the angular positions of the minima, but the angular distance between the first and second minima. So if the first is at 1.22 and the second at 2.46, the separation is about 1.24, but none of the options match. The options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the polygon isn't a circle when N is large, but it's something else. Wait, no, when N is infinitely large, it's a circle.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is about a slit with a certain number of sides, but when N is infinite, it's a different kind of diffraction. But no, I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as an approximation to a rectangular aperture when N is large. No, that doesn't make sense because a polygon with many sides would approximate a circle, not a rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a polygonal aperture, but when N approaches infinity, the pattern becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be the same as a circular aperture.

Wait, but the question says that the apothems are the same. So each side's midpoint is at a distance a from the center, which for a regular polygon, the apothem is a. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a.

So the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture with radius a, leading to the first minimum at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, the first minimum is at θ1 = (1.22 λ)/a. The second minimum is at θ2 = (2.46 λ)/a. So the difference between θ2 and θ1 is approximately (2.46 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.24 λ/a.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not regarding the separation between minima but the position of the first minimum. Because if the question is about the separation between the first two minima, then the answer would be around 1.24 λ/a, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says "the angular distance between the first two minima." Hmm, that would be the angle between the two minima, so the angle between θ1 and θ2.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about a different scenario. Maybe the polygon isn't a circle, but a regular polygon with a large N, but not infinite. But the question says N is infinitely large, so it's a circle.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is not considering the far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction but something else. But I think the far-field is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the angular spacing between consecutive minima in a different pattern. For example, in a single slit, the minima are equally spaced in terms of λ/a, but for a circular aperture, the minima are not equally spaced.

Wait, maybe I should approach this from a different angle. Let's think about the diffraction pattern for a regular polygon with a very large N.

Wait, but when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the analysis is the same as for a circular aperture.

Alternatively, perhaps the apothem a is the radius of the circle. So the radius R is a.

Wait, the angular positions of the minima for a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first zero is at approximately 3.8317 for J1(x) = 0 (so x is the argument). So the condition is a sinθ = x λ, where x is 3.8317 for the first minimum, 7.0156 for the second, etc.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. The minima in the Airy pattern occur when the argument of the Bessel function is an odd multiple of π? Or wait, the condition is J1(a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317. So for the first minimum, a sinθ = 3.8317 λ. But wait, that's much larger than the 1.22 I thought earlier. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Wait, the minima of the intensity in the Airy pattern occur when the Bessel function J1 reaches its first zeros. So for J1(x) = 0, the first solution is x ≈ 3.8317. So a sinθ = x λ, but that's the condition for the minima.

Wait, but wait, I thought the first minimum is at about θ = 1.22 λ/a. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me think again. The angular position for the minima in the Airy disk is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first zero is at x ≈ 3.8317, the second at x ≈ 7.0156, etc.

So for the first minimum, a sinθ = 3.8317 λ. So θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(a). But this is about 3.83 times λ/a. But that seems larger than I thought earlier.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up two different formulas. Wait, the single-slit (rectangular) diffraction has minima at a sinθ = mλ, where a is the slit width, and m is integer. The first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.5958 λ/a (since sinθ = λ/(a) when m=1), but that's for a single slit.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, it's the Bessel function J1 that comes into play. The minima are when J1(a sinθ / λ) = 0. So the first zero is at a sinθ = 3.8317 λ. So θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/a.

Wait, but that would be 3.83 radians if λ is 1 and a is 1, but that's more than π/2 (which is about 1.57), so the approximation tanθ ≈ θ wouldn't hold. But in the problem statement, it says to assume small angles, so tan theta ≈ theta. So perhaps the approach is different.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't considering the far-field Fraunhofer diffraction but the Fresnel case? No, because the question says the far field region.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the polygon as an array of slits or something else.

Wait, perhaps the polygon can be treated as an array of N slits arranged regularly. But when N is large, maybe it approximates a continuous distribution, leading to a different diffraction pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the diffraction from a polygonal aperture, but when N is large, it's approximated as a circle, leading to the same Airy pattern.

But I'm getting stuck because the initial approach leads to an answer not among the options, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a multi-slit system. For a regular polygon with N sides, each edge could be considered as a slit, and the overall diffraction pattern would be the product of the single-slit pattern and the interference pattern from the multiple slits.

Wait, but when N is very large, the interference pattern would be a series of very closely spaced fringes, which in the limit would become a continuous distribution, perhaps leading to the same result as a circular aperture.

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular grating with many slits, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, but the problem states that all apothems are the same length a. So each side is at a distance a from the center. Wait, maybe the radius of the polygon is a, so the diameter is 2a. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. The first minimum is at about θ = 1.22 λ/a. But wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Because if the condition is J1(a sinθ/λ) = 0, then a sinθ/λ = 3.8317, so θ = arcsin(3.8317 λ/a). But for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ 3.8317 λ/a. That's a much larger angle than 1.22 λ/a, which I thought was the first minimum.

Wait, but that can't be right because 3.83 is bigger than λ/a, so for a = λ, sinθ would be 3.83, which is impossible because sinθ can't exceed 1. So I must have messed up.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because I'm confusing the radius of the aperture with other parameters. Let's clarify:

In the case of a circular aperture, the radius is a. The first minimum occurs when the phase difference between the central ray and the rays from the edge is such that they destructively interfere. The condition for this is given by a sinθ = 1.22 λ. So θ = 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, but if a is the radius, then for a = 1.22 λ, sinθ would be 1, leading to θ = 90 degrees. So that makes sense.

But earlier I thought J1's first zero is at x ≈ 3.83, so perhaps the formula is a sinθ = x λ, where x is the first zero of J1. So if a is the radius, then a sinθ = 3.83 λ, which would imply sinθ = (3.83 λ)/a.

But that can't be right when a is small because sinθ can't exceed 1. So perhaps in the circular aperture, the condition is (π a sinθ)/λ = x, where x is the first zero of J1. So (π a sinθ)/λ = 3.8317, leading to sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (1.22 λ)/a.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. Because 3.8317 / π ≈ 1.220, so sinθ ≈ (1.22 λ)/a. So the first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a.

So, now, the first minimum is at θ1 = 1.22 λ/a. The second minimum is when J1 hits the next zero, which is approximately 7.0156. So the condition would be (π a sinθ2)/λ = 7.0156. So sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ (2.236 λ)/a.

Wait, 7.0156 divided by π is approximately 2.23. So sinθ2 ≈ 2.23 λ/a.

Wait, but if λ/a is larger than 1, then sinθ would be larger than 1, which is impossible. So perhaps a is in units where a is much larger than λ, or perhaps the problem is assuming small angles, so we can use the approximation sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says to assume small angles, so tanθ ≈ θ. So we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ.

Wait, but if the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/a, and the second at θ2 ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ 2.23 λ/a. But wait, that's 2.23, which is larger than 1.22, so θ2 is larger than θ1.

So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 ≈ (2.23 - 1.22) λ/a ≈ 1.01 λ/a.

But that's not one of the options either. The options are 0.61, 0.5, 1.22, 0.506.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

The problem says N is infinitely large, so the polygon becomes a circle. The first minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture occur at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. The second minima would be at approximately 2.46 λ/a (since 2.46 is the next zero of J1 divided by π, perhaps). So the angular separation between them is about 1.24 λ/a, which is roughly 1.22, matching option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that the second zero of J1 is at 7.0156, but perhaps I'm confusing the zeros of J1 with other zeros. Alternatively, perhaps the zeros I'm referring to are not the correct ones for the minima.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me check a reference point.

I think the minima in the Airy pattern are given by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first zero is at approximately 3.8317, so the first minimum is at θ1 where sinθ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(π a) ≈ (1.22 λ)/a.

The second zero is at approximately 7.0156, so sinθ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(π a) ≈ (2.23 λ)/a.

But the problem states that the angles are small enough that tanθ ≈ θ, which implies that θ is small, so sinθ ≈ θ.

Wait, but if a is much larger than λ, then (λ/a) is small, so θ would be small. So the angular separation between θ2 and θ1 would be approximately 1.01 λ/a, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first and second orders in a different manner.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is not about the minima in the Airy pattern but about the diffraction from a rectangular aperture. But when N is large, the polygon becomes a circle, so that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe I should think about the polygon as a set of edges. For a regular polygon, each edge can be considered as a rectangular slit, and the overall diffraction pattern is the product of the single-slit pattern and the grating pattern.

But when N is very large, the grating becomes a continuous distribution, which might approximate a circular aperture.

Alternatively, perhaps for a regular polygon, the diffraction pattern can be considered as a combination of diffraction from each side and interference effects. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simpler. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ1, and the second at θ2, so the difference is θ2 - θ1.

If the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a, and the second at 2.46 λ/a, then the separation is 1.24 λ/a. But the options don't have this. The closest is option C, which is 1.220 λ/a. But that's the position of the first minimum, not the separation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the angular position of the first minimum, not the separation. Because if the answer is option C, which is 1.220 λ/a, that would make sense.

But the question explicitly says "the angular distance between the first two minima."

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the way I approach the problem. Let's think about the diffraction formula for a polygon.

Wait, when the aperture is a regular N-gon, perhaps the diffraction pattern can be considered as a combination of N rectangular slits arranged symmetrically. So the overall pattern would be the product of the single-slit pattern and the pattern from N slits.

But when N is large, the N-slit interference becomes a continuum, leading to a diffraction pattern that's more like a circle. But perhaps the minima occur at certain angles. For a polygon with large N, the primary diffraction minimum would be similar to a circular aperture.

Wait, but maybe the condition for minima is given by some relation involving N. But since N is going to infinity, perhaps the minima are determined by the maximum extent of the polygon, which is a circle of radius a.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible options. The only option that makes sense for the first minimum is option C, 1.220 λ/a. But the question is about the separation between the first two minima.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the single-slit formula, where the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, where a is the width of the slit. So for the first minimum, m=1, so θ = λ/(a). The second minimum would be at m=2, θ=2λ/a. The separation between the first two minima would be (2λ/a - λ/a)= λ/a.

But none of the options have λ/a. However, option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is larger than λ/a.

Wait, but the options don't have λ/a, so perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a different condition, like the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a polygonal aperture, which could be different from the single slit.

Wait, given that the polygon is regular and has apothems of length a, perhaps the width of each side is something else. The apothem a is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the width (the length of each side) can be expressed in terms of a and N.

Wait, for a regular polygon with N sides, each side has length s = 2 a tan(π/(2N)).

So as N approaches infinity, tan(π/(2N)) approximates π/(2N), so s ≈ 2 a (π/(2N)) ) = (a π)/N.

Hmm, but as N approaches infinity, each side's length becomes infinitesimally small, which makes sense for a polygon approximating a circle.

But I'm not sure how this helps with the diffraction pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the minima in a circular aperture, which is a sinθ = 1.22 λ, so θ = 1.22 λ/a.

But the question is about the separation between first two minima, but for a circular aperture, the separation isn't simply the difference between 1.22 and 2.46 because the pattern isn't linear in θ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually referring to the angular distance between the central maximum and the first minimum, which is 1.22 λ/a. But that's the first minimum's position, not the separation between two minima.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 'a' so that the first minimum is at θ=λ/a. But that would give a separation of λ/a between minima, which is not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the minima of a single slit, which is a sinθ = mλ, where m is 1, 2, etc. The first minimum is at θ = λ/(a), the second at 2λ/(a), so the separation is λ/a. But the problem states that when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, so perhaps the minima condition is different.

But again, the options don't have λ/a.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as an N-sided polygon and using the formula for the diffraction pattern of a polygon, which for large N becomes a circle. The first minimum in the far field occurs at a certain angle, and the separation between the first two minima is the same as for a single slit, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum in the Fraunhofer diffraction of a polygon, which might involve the sine of the angle times the number of sides or something else.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Since the polygon becomes a circle, the answer is the same as the first minimum of the circular aperture, which is 1.22 λ/a, which is option C.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first is at 1.22 and the second at 2.46, the separation is approximately 1.24 λ/a, which isn't an option. But perhaps they're using the first minimum's position as the answer, mistaking the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the circular case but is treating the polygon as a single slit with width a, leading to the first minimum at λ/a, but again, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: What's the angular separation between the first two dark fringes in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture?

The first minimum is at θ1 = 1.22 λ/a, the second at θ2 = 2.46 λ/a. So the separation is 2.46 - 1.22 = 1.24 λ/a. But the options don't have that.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the separation. Let me compute 2.46 -1.22: 1.24. So no, that's not any of the options.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture and using the single-slit formula, but that doesn't fit with the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the far-field diffraction but about something else, like near-field or a different setup. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the condition for the minima in an aperture that's a regular polygon, but when N is very large, the minima are given by the same condition as for a single slit, but with a different effective width.

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, which is the first minimum's position, but the question is asking for the separation between the first and second minima. That would be approximately 1.24 λ/a, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the first minimum after the central maximum as the first minima, and the next as the second, so the separation is 1.22 λ/a, which is option C. But that's not correct because the separation is between the first two minima, so they are 1.24 apart.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended answer is option C, which is 1.22 λ/a, the position of the first minimum. But the question says 'angular distance between first two minima', which would be the separation, not the position of the first.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition, such as the first minima being the ones closest to the center, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's recap.

The problem states that the aperture is a regular N-gon with all apothems a. When N is infinite, the aperture is a circle with radius a. The diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture, with the first minimum at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a, and the second at θ ≈ 2.46 λ/a. The separation is about 1.24 λ/a, which isn't an option. The options given don't have this value.

Looking at the options again:

A) 0.610 λ / a

B) 0.500 λ / a

C) 1.220 λ/a 

D) 0.506 λ / a

Wait, option D is 0.506 λ/a. That's approximately half of 1.012 λ/a, which is the separation I thought earlier (1.012), but that doesn't align with anything.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the angular spacing from the central maximum to the first minimum as the first 'separation', but that's not what the question is asking.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the angular distance between consecutive minima, which in the Airy pattern is not constant. But maybe for small angles, it approximates a certain value.

Wait, but in the far-field, the angular spacing between minima in a circular aperture isn't uniform. The first minimum is at 1.22, the second at 2.46, so the separation is 1.24, as before.

But none of the options match, so perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the question is treating the polygon as an N-slit grating, and using the grating formula. For a grating with N slits, the minima occur when d sinθ = (m + 1/2) λ, where d is the slit separation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: For a polygon with N sides, each side acts as a slit of width s. The total number of slits is N. The spacing between the slits would be d = (s) / (N * sin(π/N)) ), perhaps. But when N is large, sin(π/N) ≈ π/N, so d ≈ s/(π).

But this is getting too complicated, and I'm not sure if it's leading me anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width a, leading to the first minimum at θ = λ/a. But that doesn't fit the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular aperture with width a and height very large, leading to single-slit diffraction in one dimension. But again, that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the condition for the minima in a polygonal aperture as the same as for a single slit, but in a way that the angular separation is λ/(2a), which would be 0.5 λ/a, matching option B. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about the far-field diffraction from a regular polygon. The diffraction pattern can be calculated using the Fourier transform of the aperture function. For a regular polygon, the diffraction pattern would consist of a series of rings, but when N is very large, it's a circle, so the pattern is the same as for a circular aperture.

Wait, but the question says all apothems are the same length a. So in that case, the radius of the circle is a, leading to the same diffraction pattern as a circular aperture with radius a. So the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a, and the separation between the first two minima is 1.24 λ/a, which isn't an option.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the width of the polygon is a, not the radius. So, in that case, the radius would be larger. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R as a = R cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So the radius is a. So the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/a.

But again, the separation between the first two minima isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a, but I'm not confident because the problem specifically asks about the separation between the first two minima. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a typo, and the intended answer is the first minimum's position, which is option C.

But since none of the options match the correct separation, perhaps I'm missing something in the approach. Maybe the problem is using a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum in the Fraunhofer diffraction of a polygon, which is given by a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ, where m is an integer. For the first minimum, m=0, so a sinθ = 0.5 λ. Then, θ = λ/(2a). But then the second minimum would be at m=1, so a sinθ = 1.5 λ. So the separation would be (1.5 λ/a) - (0.5 λ/a) = λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a sinθ = m λ, leading to the first minimum at θ=λ/a, and the second at 2λ/a, with separation λ/a. Again, not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the options, the only one that makes sense for the first minimum is option C, 1.220 λ/a. But the question is about the separation between the first two minima, which for a circular aperture is about 1.24 λ/a, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first minimum as the first dark ring, which is at 1.22 λ/a, and the second as the next ring at 2.46 λ/a, leading to a separation of ~1.24 λ/a. But the options don't have that.

Wait, unless the problem is using a different definition, such as considering the minima in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the circular case but about a different polygon, but I can't think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as an array of N slits, each of width a, and the overall diffraction pattern is a combination of single-slit and grating effects. But for N approaching infinity, the grating becomes a continuous structure, leading to the same result as a circular aperture.

I think I've spent enough time on this, and I'm not making progress. Based on the options and the initial analysis, the correct answer is likely option C, 1.220 λ/a, which is the position of the first minimum. But the question is about the separation between the first two minima, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking about the angle between the first minimum and the central maximum, which is the same as the position of the first minimum. So the angular distance from the center to the first minimum is 1.22 λ/a. But the question says the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be the separation between the first and second minima. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minimum as 1.22 λ/a and the second as 2.44 λ/a, leading to a separation of 1.22 λ/a, which would be option C. But I don't think the second minimum is exactly at 2.44. The actual value is around 2.46.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the first minimum after the central maximum and assuming the separation is the same as the first minimum's position. But that doesn't make sense.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the options and the analysis, the correct answer is option C, 1.220 λ/a.


The problem involves a monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ falling vertically on an aperture shaped like an $N$-sided polygon, where all apothems are of length $a$. As $N$ approaches infinity, the polygon approximates a circle, and the diffraction pattern becomes that of a circular aperture. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern.

For a circular aperture, the minima in the diffraction pattern (Airy disk) occur when the argument of the Bessel function $J_1$ is an integer multiple of $\pi$. The first minimum is at $a \sin\theta = 1.22\lambda$, corresponding to $\theta_1 \approx 1.22\lambda/a$. The second minimum occurs at $a \sin\theta = 2.46\lambda$, corresponding to $\theta_2 \approx 2.46\lambda/a$. The angular separation between the first two minima is therefore $\theta_2 - \theta_1 \approx 1.24\lambda/a$.

However, none of the provided options match this calculated separation. The closest option is $1.220\lambda/a$, which corresponds to the position of the first minimum. Given the phrasing of the question and the available options, it appears that the intended answer is the angular position of the first minimum rather than the separation between the first two minima. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
