Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. 

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't just use regular addition for velocities because that doesn't account for the effects of special relativity. Oh right, there's this formula for adding velocities in special relativity. It's something like (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1*v2)/(c²)), but wait, I should double-check that formula. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the relative speed isn't just 0.6c + 0.5c; that would give 1.1c, which is impossible because nothing can go faster than light. So the relative speed must be less than c.

Let me compute the relative velocity. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. Wait, but which one's moving faster? Oh, okay, astronaut A has a higher speed since 0.6 is more than 0.5. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c? Wait, no, that's the Galilean addition, which isn't correct at these speeds. So we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, because in relativity, the formula is a bit different. The correct formula is (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the rest frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame. Hmm, so in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity of B as seen from A would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that would be the
