Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). 

So the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. Wait, but their relative speed depends on the frame of reference. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the second from the first's perspective would be (u2 - u1) divided by 1 - (u1 u2)/(c²). Wait no, wait. Wait, I think I got that backward. Because the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute the numerator first: 0.5c - 0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. So the magnitude is about 0.14c. Negative sign indicates direction, so relative speed is 0.14c. Wait, but the options have v_rel =0.14c, so that's a possibility. Let me check the options. Option C and D have 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Next, the total energy of the system. The system's energy would be the sum of the energies of both astronauts, right? So each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for each, I need to calculate gamma.

Wait, but the masses are different. The first astronaut is 2m, moving at 0.6c. Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ). Let me compute each gamma.

For the first astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. So sqrt(1 - 0.
