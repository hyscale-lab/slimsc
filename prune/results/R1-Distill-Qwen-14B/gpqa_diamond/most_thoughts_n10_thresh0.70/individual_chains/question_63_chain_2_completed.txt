Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, changing to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of the photon. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the steps.

First, let me recall what the quantum rotation-vibration model is. Oh right, it's a model that considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. For a diatomic molecule, these are quantized. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think is the first vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. Or wait, no—vibrational states have quantum numbers, I think the ground vibrational state is n=0, and the rotational states are l=0, 1, 2, etc. So the fundamental state is probably the v=0, l=0 state.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. So the molecule would go to the next higher state. What's the next possible state? Well, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or its rotational state. Which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing given by the formula E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 would be h*w. Rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B. Because B is typically smaller than the vibrational energy spacing, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule is more likely to undergo a rotational transition when absorbing a low-energy photon.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the lowest possible, which includes the lowest vibrational and rotational states. So the next state could be either increasing J (rotational) or v (vibrational). Which transition is lower in energy? Let's compute both.

First, the vibrational energy difference. The energy difference from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE_vib = h w. Given w is 4e14 rad/s. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J*s. So ΔE_vib is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now for rotational. The rotational constant B is given by (h^2)/(8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So first, calculate the reduced mass μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. One amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So Mx is 20 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg. My is 2 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27). Let me compute denominator first: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 (1 + 0.1) )= 3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = approximately 11.0224e-53 = 1.10224e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.10224e-52 / 3.652e-26 ≈ (1.10224 / 3.652) * 1e-26 ≈ 0.3 *1e-26 = 3e-27 kg? Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 1.10224e-52 / 3.652e-26 = (1.10224 / 3.652) * 1e-52+26 → exponent is -26. 1.10224 / 3.652 ≈ 0.3, so 0.3e-26 = 3e-27 kg. Hmm, that's the reduced mass.

Then, I = μ r². r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so r=2e-10 m. So r² = (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Now B is (h²)/(8 π² I). h is 6.626e-34 J·s. h² is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²s².

8 π² is approximately 8 * (9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So B = (4.39e-67) / (78.9568 * 1.2e-46) = 4.39e-67 / (9.4748e-45) = (4.39 /9.4748) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.463 * 1e-22 ≈ 4.63e-23 J.

The energy difference for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. So ΔE_rot = 2 *4.63e-23 = 9.26e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier the vibrational transition was 2.65e-19 J, which is way larger than the rotational transition. So the molecule would need a photon with energy matching the rotational transition, which is much smaller. So the photon's energy is 9.26e-23 J.

Now, the photon's energy E is related to its momentum p by E = pc, since for photons, E = pc (because their rest mass is zero). So p = E / c, where c is the speed of light (~3e8 m/s).

So p = 9.26e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.087e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but the units for the options are N·s. Since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s, that's the same as momentum. So 3.087e-31 kg·m/s is 3.087e-31 N·s. Hmm, but none of the options are that small. Let me check my calculations.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me double-check the steps.

B is (h²)/(8 pi² I). Let me recompute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 = approx 43.9, so 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

I is 1.2e-46 kg m².

So denominator: 8 pi² I = 8 * (pi^2) *1.2e-46. Pi squared is about 9.87, so 8 *9.87 = ~78.96. 78.96 *1.2e-46 = 94.75e-46 = 9.475e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.475e-45 = 4.39e-67 /9.475e-45 = 4.39/(9.475) * 1e-22 → 0.463 *1e-22 = 4.63e-23 J. Wait, that's correct.

Hmm, but the energy for the rotational transition is 2B = 9.26e-23 J. That's correct.

Wait, but the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. My calculation gives 3e-31 N·s, which is way smaller than the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the transitions. Oh wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0, right? So the next state can be either J=1 or v=1. Which transition is allowed? Because in the rigid rotor model, the selection rule for rotation is ΔJ = ±1. Similarly, for vibration, the selection rule is Δv = ±1. But which transition is possible? Well, in the problem statement, it says the molecule is modeled by the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, non-rigid rotor—does that affect the selection rules?

Wait, no. The non-rigid rotor model (or rotation-vibration coupling) allows for some distortion in the bond during rotation, but I'm not sure how that affects the selection rules. Maybe it's more about coupling between rotational and vibrational states. But the main point is, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change either its vibrational or rotational state.

But in terms of energy, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy would match that.

But why is the momentum I calculated not matching any of the options? Let me check all steps again.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the energy of the photon. The photon's energy should be the energy difference between the initial and final states. Wait, initial state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state would be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Which one has lower energy?

Compute the energies:

For v=0, J=0: E = (0 + ½) h w + B*(0)(1) = ½ h w.

For v=0, J=1: E = (0 +½) h w + B*(1)(2) = ½ h w + 2B.

Energy difference for J transition: (½ h w + 2B) - (½ h w) )= 2B.

For v=1, J=0: E = (1 +½) h w + B*(0)(1) = 3/2 h w.

Energy difference: (3/2 h w) - (½ h w) ) = h w.

Now, h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. And 2B is 9.26e-23 J. So 2B is much smaller than h w. Therefore, the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that causes a rotational transition, as it's a lower energy jump.

So the photon's energy E_photon = 2B =9.26e-23 J.

Then, momentum p = E/c. So 9.26e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.087e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.087e-31 N·s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 N·s → 1.9e-28 kg·m/s.

B) 2.3e-27 N·s → 2.3e-27 kg·m/s.

C) 1.1e-27 → 1.1e-27 kg·m/s.

D) 1.4e-28 → 1.4e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm, my calculated p is 3e-31, which is much smaller than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for the fact that the photon's energy corresponds to the difference between the vibrational states, not the rotational.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibrational state. Wait, the fundamental state of the molecule is the lowest energy state, which includes both vibrational and rotational states. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next available state, which is either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. So the question is, which transition requires less energy.

As calculated earlier, ΔE_rot = 2B =9.26e-23 J.

ΔE_vibr = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Which is way bigger. So the photon's energy is 9.26e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 N·s. But none of the options are anywhere near that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in B.

Wait, let me recheck B.

B = h²/(8 pi² I).

h =6.626e-34 J·s → h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = μ r².

μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My).

Mx =20 amu → 20 *1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu → 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27)/(3.32e-26 +3.32e-27) → numerator is (3.32)^2 *1e-53 ≈11e-53=1.1e-52.

Denominator is 3.32e-26 (1 +0.1) )=3.652e-26.

So μ=1.1e-52 /3.652e-26 = approx 3e-27 kg.

r=2 angstroms =2e-10 m. So I = μ r² =3e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3e-27 *4e-20 =1.2e-46 kg·m².

So B = (4.39e-67) / (8 pi² *1.2e-46 )

Wait 8 pi² is about 78.96.

So denominator is 78.96 *1.2e-46 = 94.75e-46 =9.475e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.475e-45 =4.39 /9.475 * 1e-22 → 0.463 *1e-22 =4.63e-23 J.

Ah, same as before. So that's correct.

So E_photon =2B =9.26e-23 J.

p = E/c →9.26e-23 /3e8 =3.087e-31 N·s.

Hmm, but the options are all larger. So perhaps the question is asking about the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question implies the molecule is in its fundamental state, and the next state would be the first excited vibrational state—so the photon's energy corresponds to the vibrational transition.

Then, E_photon =h w=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c= 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. 8.8e-28 is closer to 1e-27, but none of the options exactly match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the possible transitions. Wait, the rotation-vibration model allows for transitions where both rotational and vibrational states change, but perhaps the transition is to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the rotational transition, and the photon's momentum is calculated correctly as 3e-31, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So Mx=20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 *1.66e-27 kg=3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx My)/(Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27)/(3.32e-26 +3.32e-27).

Denominator: 3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 = (33.2e-27 +3.32e-27)=36.52e-27 =3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator:3.32e-26 *3.32e-27= (3.32)^2 *1e-53=11.0224e-53 =1.10224e-52.

So μ=1.10224e-52 /3.652e-26 ≈ (1.10224 /3.652) *1e-26 → approximately 0.3 *1e-26=3e-27 kg.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should have used the bond length in meters correctly. 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. So r² is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

I= μ r² =3e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2e-46 kg·m². Correct.

So B= h²/(8 pi² I)= (4.39e-67)/(8pi² *1.2e-46).

Wait, 8 pi² is approx 78.96.

So denominator is 78.96 *1.2e-46 =94.75e-46=9.475e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.475e-45 =4.63e-23 J. So 2B=9.26e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.26e-23 J. Then p=9.26e-23 / (3e8) =3.087e-31 kg·m/s=3.087e-31 N·s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the model they're considering is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator. In that case, the energy levels are quantized. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

The next state could be J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). The energy required for J=1 is 2B, and for v=1 is h w.

But perhaps in some models, the allowed transitions are only vibrational, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the rotational transition.

Wait, but why would the options be so much larger than my calculation? Did I make a mistake in units somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which means that the bond length can change during rotation. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the vibrational frequency in the rotational energy calculation.

Wait, another thought: in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state because the bond length changes. But in the fundamental state, v=0, so bond length is at its equilibrium. So perhaps this doesn't affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the molecule can't have both rotational and vibrational transitions, and the question is about a vibrational transition.

Wait, but why then are the options so much larger than my calculation.

Wait, let me think about the possible photon momenta.

If the energy is 9.26e-23 J, then p=3e-31 N·s. None of the options match.

If the energy is h w=6.626e-34*4e14=2.65e-19 J, then p=2.65e-19 /3e8= 8.83e-28 N·s. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. 8.8e-28 is about 1e-27, which is option B (2.3e-27 is 2.3*1e-27). But 8.8e-28 is 0.88e-27, which isn't exactly an option, but closer to option C (1.1e-27) or A or D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: perhaps B is given by (h²)/(8 pi² I c^2), but no, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe I used the wrong formula for B.

Wait, the rotational constant B is (h²)/(8 pi² I c^2), no, that's not right.

Wait, no, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B = (h²)/(8 pi² I). So that formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the rotational constant is (h²)/(8 pi^2 I c^2), but I don't think so. No, because B has units of J.

Wait, let me compute B again.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator:8 pi² I.

I=1.2e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² I = approx 78.96 *1.2e-46=9.475e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.475e-45 =4.63e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So 2B is 9.26e-23 J.

Hmm. So I must have done this correctly, but the options don't match. Am I missing something?

Wait, maybe the question isn't about a rotational transition but a vibrational one. Let's see.

If the photon's energy is h w=2.65e-19 J, then p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28), but that's about half of that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the reduced mass again.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So Mx =20 *1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 *1.66e-27 kg=3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27).

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 =3.32e-26 (1 + 0.1) )=3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator:3.32e-26 *3.32e-27= (3.32)^2 *1e-53 =11.0224e-53=1.10224e-52 kg².

μ =1.10224e-52 / 3.652e-26 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, that's 3e-27 kg.

So I=μ r^2 =3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3e-27 *4e-20 =1.2e-46 kg·m².

So B= (6.626e-34)^2/(8 pi² *1.2e-46) = (4.39e-67) / (9.475e-45 )=4.63e-23 J.

I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy difference for the rotational transition. For J=0 to J=1, delta E is 2B. So 2 * 4.63e-23 =9.26e-23 J.

But why are the options so much larger than this? Did I perhaps confuse the photon's energy with the rotational constant?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the photon's momentum when it's in the vibrational transition. So E_photon= h w=2.65e-19 J. Then p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28, so 8.8e-28 is about 8 times larger than option A. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe the question is considering the transition from J=0 (v=0) to J=1 (v=0), which is a pure rotational transition, requiring energy 2B. So p=3e-31 N·s, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the energy of the photon for the rotational transition. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the molecule's transition from the fundamental state but the next state. Oh wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the photon's momentum to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one with the next lowest energy, which is J=1 (v=0) state. So E_photon=2B=9.26e-23 J.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the vibrational transition. Then p=8.83e-28 N·s, which is about 8.8e-28, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which would be v=1, J=0. So E_photon=h w=2.65e-19 J. p=8.83e-28 N·s, which is approximately 8.8e-28 N·s. The closest option is none, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the bond length. Wait, R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state. But since we're starting from the fundamental state (v=0), the bond length is at its equilibrium, so the rotational constant is as we calculated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences? No, because the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's either a pure rotation or pure vibration.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since my calculation for rotational transition gives a p that's much lower than the options, maybe the correct approach is the vibrational transition.

So, going back, if the photon's energy is E=h w=2.65e-19 J, then p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. 8.83e-28 is about 5.5 times larger than option A. Not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the fundamental state as v=0, but another state? No, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is different. Maybe it's the Raman effect where both rotational and vibrational transitions are involved. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: maybe the question refers to the transition from J=0 (v=0) to J=1 (v=1), which would involve both rotational and vibrational changes. But that would require a higher energy, which isn't the case for the next lowest state.

Wait, the next state after v=0, J=0 would be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. The energy of v=0, J=1 is ½ h w + 2B, and v=1, J=0 is 3/2 h w. So which is lower: 2B or h w.

We have 2B=9.26e-23 J, and h w=2.65e-19 J. So 2B is much smaller. So the next state is v=0, J=1.

So the photon's energy is 2B, which gives p=3e-31 N·s. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition within the same vibrational state. So the photon's energy is 2B, and the momentum is 3e-31 N·s. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B again.

B = h²/(8 pi² I).

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

h²= (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

I=1.2e-46 kg m².

Denominator: 8 pi² I = 8*9.8696 *1.2e-46 = 8*9.87=78.96 → 78.96 *1.2e-46=9.475e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.475e-45=4.63e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the rotational transition but in a different unit system. Hmm, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the vibrational transition but I'm miscalculating the energy. Let me check again.

E_photon= h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Correct.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking again at the options:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

So 8.83e-28 is about 8.8e-28. None of the options are exactly that, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the question is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0, which would require energy h w. But then p=8.8e-28.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the options numerically.

Option A is 1.9e-28 N·s. p=1.9e-28 kg·m/s.

E_photon = p c =1.9e-28 *3e8=5.7e-20 J.

Which is E_photon=5.7e-20 J. But h w is 2.65e-19 J, which is about 4.6 times higher. So option A's energy is about 21% of h w. Doesn't make sense.

Option B is 2.3e-27 N·s → E=2.3e-27 *3e8=6.9e-20 J. Still much less than h w.

Option C:1.1e-27 N·s →E=3.3e-20 J.

Option D:1.4e-28 →E=4.2e-20 J.

None of these match h w or 2B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational transition's photon momentum again.

p_rot=9.26e-23 J /3e8 m/s=3.087e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to v=1, J=1. But that would require even more energy. No, that's higher.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the next state is a vibrational transition, but the options don't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is talking about the transition from J=0 (v=0) to J=1 (v=1), which would involve both rotational and vibrational changes. But that would require more energy.

Wait, what's the energy of that transition? Delta E = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0).

E(v=1, J=1) = (1+½) h w + B*(1)(2) = 1.5 h w + 2B.

E(v=0, J=0) = 0.5 h w.

So delta E=1.5 h w + 2B -0.5 h w = h w +2B.

Which is 2.65e-19 +9.26e-23 =2.65e-19 +0.0000926e-19 ≈2.65e-19 J.

So E_photon≈2.65e-19 J, same as the vibrational transition.

So p_photon=8.83e-28 N·s, which is still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the fundamental state as the combined vibrational and rotational state, but only vibrational. That is, the fundamental state is v=0, and the next state is v=1 regardless of J. But that wouldn't be the case because the rotational state can also be excited.

But if the question is asking for the transition to the next state in terms of energy, which could be either rotation or vibration, but the photon must have the energy difference between these two.

But I'm stuck because the options don't match any of my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 (v=0) to J=1 (v=0), which requires energy 2B, but I'm not getting any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me recheck.

Mx=20 amu →3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu →3.32e-27 kg.

μ= (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27) → numerator=1.102e-52, denominator=3.652e-26 kg.

μ=1.102e-52 /3.652e-26= 3e-27 kg.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is in a different unit? 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. It seems like the correct photon momentum for the rotational transition is 3e-31 N·s, which isn't an option. For the vibrational transition, it's 8.8e-28 N·s, which is also not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (v=0, J=1), but the photon's energy is 2B, which would require a much smaller photon momentum than any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator and requires both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the angular momentum and see, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon momentum in the vibrational transition. So p=8.8e-28 N·s. The options don't have this, but perhaps the correct option is not listed, but the closest is option A (1.9e-28), but it's about 4.6 times smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational transition's photon momentum again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation—using the wrong formula for B.

Wait, another formula: B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I), yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational constant is given in cm^-1, but I don't think so.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition not from J=0 to J=1, but from J=1 to J=2, but that would require higher energy, which isn't the next state.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's wavelength instead of momentum, but no, the question asks for momentum.

Okay, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach. The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The next state would be the first excited state, which is either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). The one with the lower energy is (v=0, J=1), since 2B is much less than h w.

So the photon's energy is 2B=9.26e-23 J.

p_photon=9.26e-23 /3e8 =3.087e-31 N·s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, perhaps option D is the closest if I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, but I'm confident in my calculations, so perhaps the question is mistyped or I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question refers to the transition from J=0 (v=0) to J=1 (v=1), which would involve both a rotational and vibrational change. But that's not the next lowest state in energy. The next state is (v=0, J=1), which requires less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy for the transition to v=1, J=0 and see.

E_photon= h w=2.65e-19 J → p=8.8e-28 N·s.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass is in atomic mass units instead of converting to kg. Oh! Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion for the reduced mass.

Let me recalculate the reduced mass correctly.

Mx =20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 kg=3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=2 *1.66e-27 kg=3.32e-27 kg.

So μ= (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27)/(3.32e-26 +3.32e-27) → yes, same as before.

Hmm. No, that part is correct.

I'm stuck. I think I have to go with the calculation that the correct momentum is 3e-31 N·s, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A or D, assuming that the transition is vibrational. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum using the vibrational transition, which would give p=8.8e-28 N·s. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 0.21 times that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to calculate the photon's momentum for the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=1, which involves a vibrational and rotational change. But that's higher energy and not the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. But that's only if the next state is a combination, which it's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. Or perhaps I'm missing a key factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the transition to the next vibrational state, not considering the rotational. So E_photon=h w=2.65e-19 J, p=8.8e-28 N·s.

Looking again, option A is 1.9e-28. So 8.8e-28 is about 4.6 times option A. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon. Let me recheck.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon=h w=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit, like picometers. No, 2 angstroms is 200 pm, so no.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. My conclusion is that the correct photon momentum for the rotational transition is 3e-31 N·s, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps another approach: compute the angular frequency from the given data and see if that helps.

Wait, the angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. But I don't see how that helps in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require 6B, but that's higher energy than a vibrational transition.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the photon's wavelength, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with the calculation I have, even though the options don't match. But since the question expects me to choose from the options, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the photon's momentum as (h w)/(c), which would be E_photon/c.

Wait, for the rotational transition, E_photon=2B=9.26e-23 J.

p=9.26e-23 /3e8 =3.087e-31 N·s.

No, that's the same as before.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the options.

The correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended approach was to consider the vibrational transition, leading to option A or D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me check again.

Mx=20 amu →3.32e-26 kg.

My=2 amu →3.32e-27 kg.

μ=(3.32e-26 *3.32e-27)/(3.32e-26 +3.32e-27).

Denominator:3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 =3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator:3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 *1e-53=11.0224e-53=1.10224e-52.

μ=1.10224e-52 /3.652e-26 =3.02e-27 kg.

Wait, that's 3.02e-27 kg, which I approximated to 3e-27.

So I=3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg·m².

Then B= (6.626e-34)^2/(8 pi^2 *1.208e-46).

Which is (4.39e-67) / (8 pi^2 *1.208e-46).

8 pi^2 is ~78.96.

So denominator=78.96 *1.208e-46=95.2e-46=9.52e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.52e-45=4.61e-23 J.

So same as before. 2B=9.22e-23 J.

p=3.07e-31 N·s.

No help.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose, I'll go with the calculation for the vibrational transition, which gives p=8.8e-28 N·s. The closest option is none, but perhaps the intended answer is option A (1.9e-28 N·s), which is approximately 0.21 times that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition but with a different formula. Maybe the rotational constant is in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula p= h/(2 pi r), but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Another approach: compute the possible p for each option and see which energy corresponds to either 2B or h w.

Option A: p=1.9e-28 N·s →E=1.9e-28 *3e8=5.7e-20 J.

Which is about 2.15% of h w (2.65e-19 J). Doesn't match.

Option B:2.3e-27 →E=6.9e-20 J. About 2.6% of h w.

Option C:1.1e-27 →E=3.3e-20 J. About 1.25% of h w.

Option D:1.4e-28 →E=4.2e-20 J. About 1.58% of h w.

None of these match 2B=9.26e-23 J or h w=2.65e-19 J.

Hmm. I'm not seeing any connection.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different model where the energy levels are treated differently. For example, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1). And for the harmonic oscillator, E_v = (v + ½) h w.

But the transition from J=0 to J=1 would require 2B, which is 9.26e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 N·s.

But perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is a rigid rotor and the next state is J=1. So I'll go with that.

But none of the options match. So I'm forced to conclude that perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the correct answer based on the given options.

Wait, another approach: compute the energy for each option and see which corresponds to 2B or h w.

Option A: p=1.9e-28 → E=1.9e-28 *3e8=5.7e-20 J.

Option B: p=2.3e-27 → E=6.9e-20 J.

Option C:1.1e-27 →3.3e-20 J.

Option D:1.4e-28 →4.2e-20 J.

None of these energies equal 9.26e-23 J (rotational) or 2.65e-19 J (vibrational).

So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since I have to choose, I'll have to pick based on the vibrational transition, which would be option A is closest but not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the bond length in meters. 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Since my calculation for the rotational transition gives p=3e-31 N·s and that's not an option, I might have to look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited rotational state (v=0, J=1), which requires 2B. But that requires a photon with energy 9.26e-23 J, which isn't any of the options.

I think I'm stuck and have to make a guess. Based on the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A (1.9e-28 N·s), but I'm not confident.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Transitions**:  
   The molecule can transition to either a higher vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or a higher rotational state (v=0, J=1). The energy differences for these transitions are:  
   - **Vibrational transition**: \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).  
     \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).  
   - **Rotational transition**: \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \).  

2. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is calculated as \( I = \mu r^2 \), where \( \mu \) is the reduced mass and \( r \) is the bond length.  
   - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} = 3.32 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} = 3.32 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).  
   - \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(3.32 \times 10^{-26})(3.32 \times 10^{-27})}{3.32 \times 10^{-26} + 3.32 \times 10^{-27}} = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).  
   - \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so \( r^2 = 4 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{m}^2 \).  
   - \( I = \mu r^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27})(4 \times 10^{-20}) = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \).  

3. **Rotational Constant**:  
   Using \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \):  
   - \( h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2 \).  
   - \( 8 \pi^2 I = 8 \times (9.8696) \times (1.208 \times 10^{-46}) = 9.52 \times 10^{-45} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \).  
   - \( B = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{9.52 \times 10^{-45}} = 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  
   - \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  

4. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The photon's momentum is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   - For the **rotational transition**:  
     \( p = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \).  
   - For the **vibrational transition**:  
     \( p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \).  

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)) is far smaller than any of the given options. For the vibrational transition (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)), the closest option is **A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \))**, but it is still significantly smaller. None of the options match the calculated values.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the analysis, the rotational transition requires a photon with momentum \( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \), which is not listed. For the vibrational transition, the closest option is **A**, but it does not match the calculated value. Given the provided options, **A** is selected as the most reasonable choice, though it is not entirely consistent with the calculations.

ANSWER: A
