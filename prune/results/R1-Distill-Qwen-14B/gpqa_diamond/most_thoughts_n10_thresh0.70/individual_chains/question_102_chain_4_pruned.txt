Okay, so I have this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental roles. The experiment involves some genetic constructs and looking for fluorescent signals in mice. The main issue is that under the confocal microscope, they didn't see a green signal. So, I need to figure out why that happened.

First, let's understand the setup. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with specific structures. The researchers created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic vectors have two coding regions, usually under the same promoter but separated by an IRES or another element.

The vector has two main parts:
1. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Wait, no, actually, it's more like the ligand's ORF is first, with mCherry fused where? Oh, the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES. Hmm. So probably, the vector has a promoter, then the ligand ORF, then a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then an IRES, then the receptor ORF, which is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, and another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272).

Wait, stop cassettes are usually used to prevent read-through from one gene into another. So, the ligand is expressed, then the stop cassette stops it, then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. Because IRES elements can drive the expression of a second ORF without the need for a promoter, I think. So the construct should allow the ligand and receptor to be expressed separately but from the same vector.

They also made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So probably, they wanted to check if the ligand and receptor are being expressed when they transfect this vector into primary astrocyte culture. They did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin, which is a loading control. So the expression is happening.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would presumably express Cre in neural crest-derived cells. The idea is that Cre would excise the loxP sites, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

But when the offspring are born, they visualized them with a confocal microscope looking for green signals. eGFP is green, so the expectation is that the receptor-eGFP would be expressed and fluoresce green. But they didn't see it. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that explain the absence of green signal? It's more about the function, not the expression. So maybe not directly relevant here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, it's usually trafficked to the cell membrane. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't reach the cell surface where eGFP could fluoresce. So maybe, but how does the construct relate to this? Maybe the construct has issues with proper trafficking.

Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. So if the enhancer is missing, perhaps the ligand isn't expressed. But the question says that in the Western blot, the proteins were expressed when transfected into astrocytes. So it's probably expressed, but in the mouse model, maybe it's not. Wait, but the mouse construct is the bicistronic vector. Oh, wait, the CBA promoter is for the ligand, but the receptor is under IRES, which is controlled by the same promoter. So maybe the promoter is only active in certain tissues. If the promoter isn't active in the cells where the Cre is active, then the ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the Cre is under SOX10, which is neural crest. So if the CBA promoter
