Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, I'll try to draw the target molecule. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's count the positions. Wait, numbering might be tricky. Let me think: the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So the ring has three substituents, each in adjacent positions. Wait, no, position 1, 2, 3 are all adjacent? No, in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a row. So the substituents are ortho to each other. So the structure is such that the ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in 3, and tert-butyl in 2. Wait, no, that can't be right because in that case, the nitro and tert-butyl would be meta to each other? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: Benzene is a six-membered ring. If substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, then they are in a row, each adjacent
