Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a proton and an antiproton are annihilating each other and producing two particles of type A plus and two of A minus. The reaction is written as p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle A times c squared is 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A. The options given are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they convert into other particles. Since a proton and antiproton are colliding, their rest masses and kinetic energy will play a role here. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe I can approximate that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy? Or wait, no, even if it's moving slowly, when the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, but in this case, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the system is p and p̄ annihilating into two A⁺ and two A⁻. So perhaps I should consider conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, their rest masses are the same because the proton is matter and the antiproton is antimatter, so m_p = m_p̄. But wait, the problem says the mass of A is given, m_A c² = 300 MeV. I suppose the proton's mass is around 938 MeV/c², but maybe I can use that.
