Alright, so I've got this science question here about barley and some gene mutations. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Okay, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem is that this compound makes the barley unusable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. Now, they used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. Then they sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So I guess that means the gene causing the compound's synthesis is malfunctioning. So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Looking at the options, I need to look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene. Let me write down the sequences to compare.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing to the intact, let's see the differences. Let's break it down. First part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Wait, the second codon in the intact is TTT (Ser), in Mutant 1 it's TCT (Ser). Oh wait, that's a silent mutation because it's same amino acid. Then the third codon: CTC in intact is CGA in Mutant1?

Wait, let me look again. Intact third part: TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So the third codon is CTC (Leu). In Mutant1, the third codon is TAC (maybe Tyr? Wait, wait, let me get the exact spots.

Wait, the initial part is the same for the first 9 nucleotides? Let me count:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC...

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look at the exact changes. Maybe it's easier to compare each position.

Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA …

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGC …

So, at position 3-5, the intact is TTT, mutant is TCT. Hmm, that's a change from TTT to TCT at the second codon. TTT is Serine, TCT is also Serine, so no change in amino acid. Then, position 6-8 in intact is CTC
