Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to find the concentrations after dilution, then figure out what happens during titration, especially at 25% and equivalence points.

Wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So the initial acetic acid is 0.05 M, but we're adding an equal volume of water. Oh right, the dilution formula is C1V1 = C2V2. So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³, the total is 40 cm³.

So the new concentration, C2, would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that. 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (which provides OH-) is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So I think I need to find the equivalence point volume.

Wait, but wait. The initial moles of acetic acid: volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) times 0.05 M. 0.02 *0.05 = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per liter, so 0.05 *0.02 = 0.001 moles.

The NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is same as moles of acetic acid, 0.001. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But wait, the question says "at 25% titration". So 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³, we're at 25% titration.

So now, at 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? 2.5
