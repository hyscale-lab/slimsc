Okay, so I've got this question about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have different physical properties like the way they rotate plane-polarized light.

The question is asking which of the four organic compounds listed can show optical isomerism. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each listing different combinations.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with substituents at 2 and 2' positions. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' and methyl esters at 2 and 2'. Wait, but the structure here, do any of these groups create a chiral center? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups.

Looking at the molecule, the central biphenyl structure might have some symmetry. But wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions. Let me visualize this. Each phenyl ring has a methyl ester at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1', so the two rings are attached at those positions. Now, considering the possibility of a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are in such a way that a plane exists, then there might not be any chiral centers. Wait, but the nitro groups are on the same side? Or opposite? No, wait, their positions are 6 and 6', which are on the same ring as the 1 and 1' connections.

Hmm, maybe the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Wait, if the two rings are connected in a way that makes substituents mirror images, perhaps. But if the arrangement is such that the substituents are on opposite sides, there might be a possibility of a chiral center. Or maybe the molecule itself is chiral.

Wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality if the two rings are connected in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable. Oh wait, yes! If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Because the biphenyl moiety itself can have a stereogenic axis if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

So looking at this compound, it's dimethyl esters at 2 and 2', and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Since each ring has an ester and a nitro group in specific positions, perhaps the arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry. So maybe this compound has axial chirality, making it capable of optical isomerism. So I think compound 1 can show optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but as the ester, it's OMe. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOMe. Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH3)CO-O-CH2-OH? No, wait, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- esterified with methyl. Wait, no, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-; then 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So structure
