Okay, I have to solve this chemistry question. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But then the problem splits into two parts, A and B. Let me take them one by one.

Part A: Which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does NOT show tautomerism?

Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift an H and a lone pair, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that, the compound must have adjacent carbonyl groups so that the hydrogen can shift, creating an enol form.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Wait, benzoquinone can be 1,2-dione, 1,3-dione, or 1,4-dione. But regardless, if it's a quinone, like 1,4-benzoquinone, it has two carbonyl groups opposite each other. Does that allow for tautomerism? Well, I'm not sure. Wait, tautomerism usually involves a conjugated system where the hydrogen can move. If the carbonyl groups are adjacent, maybe. For example, 1,2-diketones can have enol tautomerism because the H can shift between the two carbonyls. So if benzoquinone is 1,2, then it has tautomerism. But if it's 1,4, then the two carbonyls are not adjacent, so maybe they can't form the enol form. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because the carbonyls are conjugated with the aromatic ring, which might not allow for the necessary H shift.

Wait, another thought: Tautomerism requires that there's a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. Benzoquinone, if it's 1,4, each carbonyl is on opposite ends. The ring is conjugated, so the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic structure. Does that mean they don't have alpha hydrogens? Because in some cases, like benzophenone, the carbonyl groups are on a benzene ring, but if the ring is already conjugated, maybe the alpha positions don't have H's. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the structure
