Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to walk through each reaction and see what's happening.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. So, the first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Hmm, when a ketone reacts with bromine, I think it's usually a type of addition reaction. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, and bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent like CCl4 would probably lead to a dibromination. But wait, wait, no, wait. Oh right, cyclohexanone under certain conditions can undergo a bromination. Wait, what's the typical reaction of ketones with bromine? Oh, I think it's the cyclohexanone undergoing the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but wait, no, that's for carboxylic acids. Or maybe it's the bromination of the alpha position. Oh, right! When a ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with HBr or something, it can lead to alpha bromination. But wait, the question just says bromine. So maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. But wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone. When you add Br2 to a ketone, you might form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromohydrin. No, that's when water is present. Hmm. Maybe I should look up what happens when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine.

Wait, I think when a ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with excess bromine (Br2) under certain conditions, it can undergo a ring-opening. But more likely, the alpha carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) undergo bromination. So, cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons, each with two hydrogens. So adding bromine would cause a bromide to add to the alpha position. Let me think: the carbonyl is C=O. The adjacent carbons (each CH2) are alpha. So adding Br would substitute one of those Hs. So product 1 would be 2-bromocyc
