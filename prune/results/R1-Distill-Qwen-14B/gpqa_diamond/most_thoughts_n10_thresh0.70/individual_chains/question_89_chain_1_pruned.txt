Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get pretty tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Oh, and there's an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Hmm, IR peaks around 1720 usually indicate carbonyl groups, like ketones or esters. But wait, KOH is a strong base, so maybe elimination happened here.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromines opposite each other. Heating with KOH—bromides are good leaving groups. Since there are two bromines, maybe we're looking at a double elimination. So, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation, leading to an alkene.

If it's an elimination, when two adjacent bromine atoms are removed, we would form a double bond. But wait, the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. If both leave, perhaps forming an allene (a conjugated diene?) but that might not be right because the positions would be 1 and 3 on a diamond structure.

Alternatively, maybe each bromide is on a bridgehead. So when KOH is used, perhaps each Br- leaves, and the adjacent C-H bonds break, leading to formation of a double bond. Wait, but that would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a bicyclic compound with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trans elimination, forming a bridge between carbons 1 and 3, making a ring structure with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, might undergo an elimination to form an adamantane diene. But the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That
