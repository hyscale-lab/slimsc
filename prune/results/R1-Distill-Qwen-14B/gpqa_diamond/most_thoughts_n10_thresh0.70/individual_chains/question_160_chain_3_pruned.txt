Okay, so I've got this physics problem about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls vertically on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, using the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles. But this isn't a single slit; it's a polygonal aperture. When N is large, the polygon approximates a circle, right? So maybe I can think of it as a circular aperture for this case.

Wait, but the question is about the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the minima are given by the Bessel function zeros, but for the far field, the first minimum is about 1.22λ/a, where 'a' is the radius. But wait, in this problem, 'a' is the apothem of the polygon. What's the apothem in a regular polygon? The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon with N sides, as N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' approaches the radius of the circle. So in that limit, the apothem 'a' is equal to the radius 'R' of the circular aperture.

So in that case, the first minimum for a circular aperture occurs at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a) or something else? Wait, no. The diffraction formula for single slit (approximating to circular as N→∞) gives the minima at θ where the Bessel function J1 reaches zero. The first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(diameter), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the formula for the minima in a single-slit (rectangular) diffraction is sinθ = λ/(a), where 'a' is the slit width, but that's for the first minimum. But that's not applicable for a circular aperture. Wait, no, for a single slit, the min
