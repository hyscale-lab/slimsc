Okay, I'm trying to figure out what this unknown compound is based on the spectroscopic data given. Let me go through each piece of evidence step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, often around 2500-3300. So maybe that's the case here. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring, like C=C stretch, or perhaps conjugated carbonyl groups.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group. Also, the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR suggests that there is a double bond somewhere in the structure, maybe part of a ring or as a substituent.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what that could be. The molecular ion is the highest m/z, so the fragment at 45 is a piece of that. Possible fragments at 45 could be from CH3OCH2 something? Wait, 45 is CH3OCH2+ maybe? Or perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a carbonyl group fragment. Let me think about the molecular formulas given.

The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So molecular formulas vary in oxygen count and hydrogen count.

Let me approach this systematically.

First, FTIR:
- Broad peak ~3000: O-H stretch. So the compound has an O-H group. Could be alcohol, carboxylic acid, phenol, or maybe an ether... But wait, ethers don't have O-H. So maybe an alcohol or phenol or carboxylic acid.

The two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is probably a carbonyl (C=O). 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl groups or an aromatic ring with C=C. So maybe the structure has a carbonyl and a double bond, either as part of an aromatic ring or an alkene.

So possible functional groups: maybe a ketone and an alcohol? Or an ester and an alcohol? Or a carboxylic acid and some other group.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be very broad and strong. So that's possible. Let's think about that.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so an alkene is present. So the structure has an alkene.

Mass spec fragment at 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is the mass of CH3OCH2+ (maybe), but I'm not sure. Alternatively:

45 could be (CH3)2O+? No, (CH3)2O is ether, molecular weight is 45 (15+16*2 + 12*2 = 45? Wait, no. Let me compute: (CH3)2O: C2H6O, so 2*12 +6*1 +16= 24+6+16=46. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CO+ fragment. CH3CO is 43 (12*2 + 3 +16= 44? Wait, 12*2=24, H3 is 3, O is 16: 24+3+16=43. Hmm. So 43. Then maybe a CH2O+? That's formaldehyde, but that's 30.

Wait,
