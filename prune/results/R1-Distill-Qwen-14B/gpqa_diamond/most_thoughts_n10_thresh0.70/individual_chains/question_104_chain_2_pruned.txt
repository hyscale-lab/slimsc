Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little bit back and forth as the planet orbits it. 

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

For planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is understanding how the RV method relates the measured shift to the planet's orbital period. The formula I remember involves some relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 day) ) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version. Since the planets have similar masses and the stars are the same, and the orbits are circular (e=0), maybe the shifts are related to their velocities, which in turn relate to their orbital periods and masses.

Alternatively, I think the shift is related to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, the denominator (1 + M_p/M_*) is approximately 1. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p) / M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, but for the same M_*, same M_p, how does K relate to the period P? Let's see: K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3
