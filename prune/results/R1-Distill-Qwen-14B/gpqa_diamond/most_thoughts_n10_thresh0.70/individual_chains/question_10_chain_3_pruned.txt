Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to find out which one has the highest density. Let me think about what I know.

So the question gives four options, a to d, each describing a different planet. I need to compare their densities. Wait, but how do I find the density of each?

I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh right! So for each planet, I need to calculate density by knowing mass and radius (since volume depends on radius). But wait, some of them don't give the radius directly. Hmm.

Looking at the options:

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So Earth's mass is about 5.97e24 kg, and radius is about 6,371 km. But maybe I don't need exact numbers because I can compare them relative to Earth.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5 g/cm続. Wait, the density is already given here. So that's 5.5 g/cm続. Wait, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm続 as well. So this planet has a density equal to Earth's but twice the mass. Hmm, but wait, if density is mass/volume, and mass increases but volume depends on radius cubed.

Wait, but in option b, the density is given as 5.5, which is the same as Earth's. So that would imply that the density is same as Earth. But the question asks for the highest density. So I'll keep that in mind.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition usually means same density, right? Because composition affects density. So if it's same as Earth, then the density is same as Earth. But wait, what if the mass increases? Because density is mass/volume. If mass increases but volume increases as well, but if composition is same, then density remains same. So for option c, density is same as Earth, so 5.5 g/cm続.

Wait, but wait. If a planet has same composition as Earth but is more massive, it might be larger in radius. Because more mass would require a larger size, but if the composition is same, the density remains same. So option c's density is same as Earth, which
