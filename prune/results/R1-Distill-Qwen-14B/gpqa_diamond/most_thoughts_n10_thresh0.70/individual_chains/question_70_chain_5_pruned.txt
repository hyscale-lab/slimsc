Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and jot down the key points.

The question describes a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to map out the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. Let me think about what each of these reactions might be. The first thing that stands out is product C being a bright red solid. I remember that many metal sulfides are bright red, but wait, another possibility is that it's a transition metal compound. Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a transition metal oxide with a red color. Alternatively, considering the reactions, maybe it's a compound that forms when a metal reacts with a halogen.

Wait, but let's look at the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. That suggests that C could be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. Hmm. So maybe C is an sulfide? Or perhaps a nitride? Or something else.

Wait, when a sulfide reacts with water, it typically produces H2S (a gas, but perhaps F or G is H2S?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, it might produce NH3 and an acid. Wait, but in the problem, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So maybe C is something like a metal carbide? Or perhaps a sulfide?

Alternatively, let's think about the reactions of metals with halogens. For example, when a metal (A) reacts with a halogen (B), it forms a salt (C). For instance, sodium (A) reacting with chlorine (B) forms NaCl (C), but that's a white solid. Hmm, but the problem says bright red. Maybe it's a different metal. Let's think: copper and sulfur form CuS (but that's more of a black solid), or maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a metal with a diatomic halogen. For example, Fe and Cl2 can form FeCl3, which is a reddish solid. Oh wait, FeCl3 is a yellowish-brown, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a different metal. Hmm.

Wait, the first reaction: 8 equivalents of gas B. So gas B is probably a diatomic molecule, like Cl2 or O2, where each molecule provides two atoms. So, for example, if B is Cl2, and A is Fe, then Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. Wait, but how many equivalents? For FeCl3, the reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So if that's the case, 3 moles of Cl2 per 2 moles of Fe. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of B. So perhaps the ratio is different.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is something like Mg reacting with Cl2 to form MgCl2. The reaction is 2 Mg + Cl2 → 2 MgCl2. So for 1 mole of Cl2, 2 moles of Mg are used. So in that case, if A is Mg and B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) would imply 8 moles, so 4 moles of Mg would react? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The equivalents would depend on the stoichiometry. For example, if the reaction is A + B → C, and B is in excess, but perhaps the stoichiometry is 4 A + B → C, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Let me think about product C reacting with gas D. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of D, it produces E. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents like H2O, but D and B are gases, so maybe H is something like HCl or NH3? Wait, H is a solvent, so D plus B forms H, which is a solvent. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2, then H would be HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is H2S, but that's a gas too. Hmm.

Wait, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio. So if B is Cl2, then D could be H2, since 1 mole of Cl2 plus 1 mole of H2 would form 2 moles of HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2, and D is H2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So if B is O2 and D is H2, their reaction would produce H2O.

Wait, but let me think: B is a gas. If B is O2, and D is H2, then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. So that could fit.

So, going back: A is a solid metal. B is O2. So the first reaction is A (metal) + 8 equivalents of O2 → C (bright red).

Wait, but when a metal reacts with O2, it forms an oxide. For example, iron reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Which of these is bright red? Iron(
