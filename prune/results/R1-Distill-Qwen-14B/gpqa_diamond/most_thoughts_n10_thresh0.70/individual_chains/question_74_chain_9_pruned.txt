Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says. 

So, the setup is that we have an atom, and we want to observe its decay. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But wait, in this case, 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, we're being asked what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, does that mean the next 150 minutes from now (so 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total) or the next 150 in addition to the 50 that have already passed? I think it's the next 150 after the 50, so total 200 minutes.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key thing is that the decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed without decay. So, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay shouldn't change the probability for the next period. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the decay constant.

The decay probability given is 32% (which is 0.32) within 100 minutes. I think the decay law is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the
