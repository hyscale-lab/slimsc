Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but let's try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The problem starts with compound A, which shows two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. We need to identify D from the given options.

Hmm. Let's break this down. Starting with the NMR of compound A. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these protons are likely from a methyl group adjacent to another CH2 group, as triplets in NMR usually indicate coupling with two neighboring protons. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H probably comes from a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. Wait, but 4H as a quartetâ€”maybe it's two equivalent CH2 groups each showing as quartets.

Wait, the splitting in NMR is determined by neighboring protons. A triplet implies that each proton is next to a CH2 group (n+1 = 3, so n=2, so two adjacent protons). The quartet would be from a CH2 next to a CH2 (so each of the four H would be next to two H on each adjacent group).

So maybe the structure of A is something like two CH2CH(CH2CH3) groups or similar. Wait, another common structure with such NMR signals is neopentyl groups or maybe a diethyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, let me think. If A is a diethyl group attached to something. For example, if A is (CH2CH2CH3)2 something. Wait, no.
