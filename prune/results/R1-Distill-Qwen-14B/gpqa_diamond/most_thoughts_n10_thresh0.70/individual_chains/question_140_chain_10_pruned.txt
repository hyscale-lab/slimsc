Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about a reaction involving substance X and Y, and the products formed. Hmm.

The first part says that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That probably means X is a compound where one of the elements has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. For example, maybe it's something like Cl, which has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. But I'm not sure yet.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about what gases could be that. Oh, maybe something like CO2? No, wait, CO2 has 12+16*2 = 44 g/mol, but that's not the point. The molecule's structure-wise, same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, each atom of W would have same number of neutrons and protons. So each atom is like a noble gas perhaps? Or maybe a diatomic molecule where each atom has equal p and n.

Wait, the molecule of W has same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think: for example, H2 would have each H having 0 neutrons (assuming H-1) and 1 proton. So each H has 0 neutrons. So for H2, each molecule has 2*(1 proton, 0 neutrons). So total in the molecule: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not same. So that's not it.

What about O2? Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since O-16 is common). So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So W could be O2. But wait, the problem says the gas is released when X reacts with Y.

Wait, but maybe W is H2O? No, because H2O is a liquid under standard conditions
