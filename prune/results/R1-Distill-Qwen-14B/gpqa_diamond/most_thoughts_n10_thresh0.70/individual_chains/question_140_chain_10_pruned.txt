Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stumped, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what I can figure out.

So, the problem is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. Hmm, okay.

Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially because of its analog. I remember that some reagents are used for specific reactions, like maybe something with sulfur or phosphorus? Wait, but wait, the clue about the heavier isotope might point towards something like sulfur, which has multiple isotopes. Or perhaps it's another element.

Let me break it down piece by piece.

First, let's think about the gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the number of neutrons equals protons. That means it's either a noble gas or maybe hydrogen? Because hydrogen's molecule is H2, which has 1 proton and 1 neutron each (if it's deuterium), but wait, H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons in total. Wait, no, each H atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the number of protons (2) equals the number of neutrons (2). That fits. Alternatively, helium as He is a noble gas, but He is monoatomic, so maybe that's not the case. Or maybe another noble gas with equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, let me think: for the molecule, the total number of protons and neutrons must be equal. So, if it's a molecule, perhaps CO2 or something, but that doesn't fit. Let's consider possible gases where the molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, another approach: what about NH3? No, because it's a gas but the molecule would have 14 (N) + 3*(1) (H) = protons, but that's 17. The neutrons would be different. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the gas is CO2. But CO2 has
