Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So, when the planet tugs the star towards us, the spectral lines shift to a shorter wavelength (blue shift), and when it moves away, they shift to a longer wavelength (red shift). The periodicity of this shift tells us about the planet's orbit.

The problem states that two stars have the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are about the same mass, right? And both have circular orbits. The key here is comparing the detected Doppler shifts of their spectral lines.

Wait, what's given about the shifts? Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. So why would the shift be different? Oh, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the Doppler shift (radial velocity) is something like v = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part goes away. Also, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the same for both stars since they're Sun-like.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 AU * (1 year)^-1 ) ) ) ) )^(1). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate K ≈ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / [ (1 + (M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )^(1) ] ) ). But wait, since M_p is much less than M_star, M_p/M_star is negligible, so I can ignore that denominator. Thus, K is approximately proportional to M_p / (M_star^(1/3)).

Wait, but in this problem, both stars are the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have the same mass as Neptune. So M_p is the same, M_star is the same. So then K should be the same for both planets. But that's not the case here. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has 7. So the shift is higher for Planet #2. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Let's think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) ] * [ 1 / ( (1 AU )^(1/3) * (1 year) ) ) ]

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the simplified version where K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (P^(-1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to remember the expression for the velocity semi-amplitude.

Another approach: The radial velocity method depends on the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity amplitude K is given by K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/
