Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the details, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars, same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. The planets have circular orbits, and the RV method detected them. 

The key data given is the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of the host stars. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves in a small orbit around the barycenter of the system, and that movement shifts the spectral lines. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, right? Wait, no, wait. Or maybe the other way around?

Wait, no. The RV method's Doppler shift depends on the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. But since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets are similar to Neptune (so same mass as each other?), perhaps the shifts are related to their orbital periods or velocities.

Wait, but wait. I think the Doppler shift is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The semi-amplitude K is given by a formula. What's that formula again? I think it's K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p)^2 ) / (M_star * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * (2π)) )^(1/3) ) / c, but maybe I'm mixing up terms.

Alternatively, there's a more straightforward relation. I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) ), but perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), perhaps the only varying factor is the orbital period. But wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbital period and the mass.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) / ( (2π c) * (M_star) ) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (27 * π * G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2
