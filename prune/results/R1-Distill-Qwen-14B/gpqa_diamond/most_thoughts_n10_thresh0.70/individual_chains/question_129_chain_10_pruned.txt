Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem again.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. There are four compounds A, B, C, D, E, each formed from the previous via specific reactions. The options are given as A to D, each being a cyclic ketone. The hints also provide some clues, which I need to parse carefully.

Let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D loses an inert gas to form E.

There are also two hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR spectra: A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, E around 1715 cm^-1.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each step.

First, the IR peaks. A has a peak at ~1750, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe a ketone or an aldehyde or ester. But aldehydes have higher frequencies, around 1720 or so, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, esters are around 1735-1765, ketones around 1700-1750, so 1750 could be an ester or a ketone. Wait, but the peak in compound E is at 1715. That's a bit lower than a typical ketone. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ketone? Or maybe it's an aldehyde, but that seems less likely.

Wait, no. Aldehydes usually have higher wavenumbers, like 1710–1740. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: Aldehydes have C=O around 1715–1740 cm-1. Ketones are a bit lower, say 1680–1720. So 1750 is probably an ester or maybe an acid chloride; but A is a starting material, so maybe an ester or a ketone. But in reaction 1, A reacts with HCN. What's the typical reaction between a carbonyl and HCN?

HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, the cyanohydrin addition: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. So the product B would be a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, HCN would add as well, but aldehydes are less common in such reactions since they are more reactive, but maybe in this case.

Wait, but the product after adding HCN is B. Then B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a hydrogenation catalyst. So if B is a nitrile (from HCN addition?), hydrogenation would reduce nitriles to amines. Wait, but HCN addition to a ketone would give a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with a CN group attached. So for example, if A is cyclopentanone, B would be cyclopentane cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group.

Wait, but the reaction of a ketone with HCN is a nucleophilic addition: the H- from HCN adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN- adds to the oxygen. So the product would be a geminal diol with a nitrile and an alcohol group? Hmm, wait no. Let me think again. No, when a ketone reacts with HCN, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is
