Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and gamma-ray annihilation. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma-gamma → e+ e-. 

The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. So, I guess this has to do with the concept of photon-photon interactions and how it affects the propagation of gamma-rays. If the gamma-rays are too high energy, they might annihilate quickly, limiting their lifetime.

I think the key here is to calculate the threshold energy where this annihilation becomes significant. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. Wait, but wait, the CMB photons are usually considered to have a certain energy, but I think the average energy is about that. Or maybe it's the typical photon energy from the blackbody spectrum. Oh right, the CMB is a blackbody with a temperature of about 2.7 K. The peak wavelength is around that, but the average photon energy is a bit higher, but in any case, the problem states it's 1e-3 eV on average.

The process gamma + gamma → e+ + e- requires that the combined energy of the two photons is enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So, each photon must have enough energy. But since the gamma is high energy and the CMB photon is low energy, the sum needs to be at least 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The energy and momentum need to satisfy the condition for pair production. The threshold condition is when the center-of-mass energy is equal to twice the electron mass. So, the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c², where s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame.

But in this case, one photon is the high-energy gamma (E1), and the other is the CMB photon (E2 = 1e-3 eV). So, let's model this.

The energy and momentum of the photons. Since photons are massless, their energy is E = pc. So, for each photon, E = pc, and so p = E/c.

The center-of-mass (COM) energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta might be opposite. Wait, but in the CMB frame, the photons are isotropic, but when considering a gamma-ray moving through the CMB, it's moving in a certain direction, and the CMB photons have a direction as well. But perhaps for the threshold condition, we can assume that the two photons are moving towards each other, which would maximize the COM energy. Because, for the process to occur, the photons must collide head-on. Otherwise, the energy available might not be sufficient.

So, assuming the photons are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum in the COM frame would be the difference of their momenta. Let me think: the gamma has energy E1 and momentum p1 = E1/(c), and the CMB photon has energy E2 and momentum p2 = E2/(c), but since they're moving opposite, their momenta subtract.

Wait, no. I think in the lab frame, where the CMB is isotropic, but for the interaction, the gamma is moving, say, in the +x direction, and the CMB photon is moving in the -x direction. So, their momenta are in opposite directions.

So, the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is (E1/(c) - E2/(c)) [since the CMB photon is moving opposite].

Then, the square of the COM energy is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - [ (E1 - E2)/c * c ]^2 * c^2. Wait, maybe I should just write it out.

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2.

But p1 = E1/(c), p2 = E2/(c), so p1 c = E1, p2 c = E2.

So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expanding that:

(E1 + E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²

(E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²

Subtracting them: (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

So, s = 4 E1 E2.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the square of the COM energy is s = 4 E1 E2. So, the COM energy is 2 sqrt(E1 E2).

But for pair production to happen, the COM energy must be at least 2 m_e c². So,

sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c² = sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2)

Wait, so 2 sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ 2 m_e c². Cancel the 2's: sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ m_e c².

Square both sides: E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So, E1 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E2.

Wait, E2 is given as 1e-3 eV. Let me compute (m_e c²)^2.

The electron rest energy is m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 1e6 eV = 5.11e5 eV.

So, (m_e c²)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV. So,

E1 ≥ (2.61e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, that's 2.61e14 eV. Let's convert that into GeV. Since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, 2.61e5 GeV is 261,000 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which matches.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * (1e5)^2 eV² = 26.1121 * 1e10 eV² = 2.61121e11 eV². Correct.

Divide by E2 = 1e-3 eV: (2.61121e11) / (1e-3) = 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61121e5 GeV.

So E1 is about 2.61e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So, that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. What if the approach is different? Because in the universe, the CMB photons are isotropic, so perhaps the average rate is considered. But I think in the threshold condition, we consider the highest possible energy, which is when the CMB photon is moving opposite to the gamma. So the calculation I did should be correct.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The key is that the center-of-mass (COM) energy of the system must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is $2m_e c^2 = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$.

The COM energy squared, $s$, is given by:

\[
s = 4E_1E_2,
\]

where $E_1$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_2$ is the energy of the CMB photon. For the process to occur, the COM energy must satisfy:

\[
\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2.
\]

Substituting $s = 4E_1E_2$ and solving for $E_1$, we find:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}.
\]

The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$. Squaring this gives:

\[
(m_e c^2)^2 = (5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV})^2 = 2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values into the formula for $E_1$:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting this to GeV:

\[
E_1 \geq 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} \div 10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) 2.6*1e5 GeV**
