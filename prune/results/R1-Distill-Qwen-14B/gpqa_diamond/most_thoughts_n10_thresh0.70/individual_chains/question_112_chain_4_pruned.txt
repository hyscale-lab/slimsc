Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Let's see what the problem says.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, since it's proportional, I need to make sure it's normalized. So first, I should probably normalize this state. Let me write that down.

The state is |alpha> = c * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], where c is the normalization constant. To find c, I need to compute the inner product and set it equal to 1.

The inner product is <alpha|alpha> = |c|^2 [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ] because when you take the inner product, |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so cross terms cancel out.

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: (1-i)(1+i) = (1)^2 + (1)(i) - (i)(1) + (i)(-i). Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So (1+i)(1-i) = 1² - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Second term: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2² - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the inner product is |c|^2 (2 +5) = |c|^2 *7. Since it's normalized, |c|^2 *7 =1 → |c|=1/sqrt(7). So c is 1/sqrt(7).

So the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the problem asks about the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix elements are given by A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what is this operator? Let me think about the basis.

Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates |up> and |down> are the basis. So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Let me write that out.

The matrix for A is:
[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Now, this operator is a 2x2 matrix. I need to find its eigenstates because the probabilities will be the square of the amplitudes when expressed in those eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize matrix A. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A
