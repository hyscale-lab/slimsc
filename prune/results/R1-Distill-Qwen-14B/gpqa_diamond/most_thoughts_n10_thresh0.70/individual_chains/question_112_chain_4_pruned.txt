Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this so I'm going to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question involves an electron state described by |alpha>, which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because quantum states should have a norm of 1, right?

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's calculate the normalization factor. The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. So, the coefficient for |up> is (1+i), whose absolute value squared is |1+i|². The real part is 1, imaginary part is 1. The square is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2 - i), so |2 - i|² is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 = 5. So the total norm is 2 + 5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> .

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that matrix look like?

Hmm, the matrix is 2x2 since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles. Let me write it out. The diagonal elements (i=j) are zero because if i=j, A_ij is zero. So the matrix is:
[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, when i≠j, A_ij = ħ/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would be:
Row 1: [0, ħ/2]
Row 2: [ħ/2, 0]
So A = (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix (sigma_x), because sigma_x has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on. So A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check. No, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So yes, A is (ħ/2) σ_x. So this operator A is proportional to σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x. Because if I have an operator proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. So the eigenstates are (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>) and (1/sqrt(2))(|up> - |down>).

So we need to find the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates. The eigenstates are |+x> and |–x>, let's say. Alternatively, I can write them as |r> and |l> or something
