Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

Alright, the problem says that the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, which probably means standard conditions, so maybe activity coefficients are close to 1, but I might not need that for this problem.

Wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But wait, phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The H3PO4 has three dissociation steps, with Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 given: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. So the relevant equilibria are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

But wait, in solution, the phosphate species will depend on the pH. Since we're adding a mixture of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively, I think the solution is probably a buffer solution. Because when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you get a buffer. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are known. Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Oh, right, so
