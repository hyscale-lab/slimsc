Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Then they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside, so its distance from the conductor's center is L, and from the cavity's center it's l. The angle between l and s is theta. Oh, right, and l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside.

So, what do I remember about electric fields in such setups? I think when you have a conductor, the charges redistribute in a certain way. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, the presence of the charge +q in the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) would have an induced charge of -q because the conductor is neutral overall. Then the outer surface must have +q to balance, but wait no. Wait, no, the conductor was initially neutral. So the charge in the cavity is +q. The inner surface would have an induced -q, and the outer surface must have +q, because the total conductor's charge is zero. Wait, no: the total charge of the conductor itself is zero. So the conductor's net charge is zero. So the inner surface has induced charge -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because conductor's total charge is inner (-q) plus outer (+q), which is zero. Oh wait, no: inner is -q, outer is +q, so total is zero, which matches the uncharged conductor. Got it.

Now, when it comes to the electric field outside the conductor, like at point P. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed within the sphere. Wait, but in this case, the conductor itself has a net charge of zero, because it's uncharged. But wait, the outer surface has +q. So the total charge outside would be +q. So the electric field outside would be like that of a point charge +q at the center.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's charge is zero. But the charge in
