Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium like glass is generally less than c, the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Oh right, so it's like the glass is moving towards the observer. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I need to use some relativity here.

Wait, the problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity v. So it's in uniform motion. I'm trying to remember if Galilean transformations apply here or if we need to consider special relativity. Since the speed is constant, maybe Galileo's approach is enough because v is much less than c. Or wait, no, because in the case of light, even if the source is moving, the speed remains c. Oh wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is not c. Wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c, but the glass has an index of refraction n. So the speed inside the glass is c/n, right? But wait, this is without considering the motion of the glass itself.

Now, the glass is moving. If I'm in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards me, how does that affect the speed of light inside the glass as I observe it?

I think I should consider the frame of the glass first. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at
