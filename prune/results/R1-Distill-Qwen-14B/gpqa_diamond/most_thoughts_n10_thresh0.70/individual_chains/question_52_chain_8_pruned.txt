Okay, I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, there's a star with certain characteristics, and when it has spots, some things change. I need to find the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, and how that ratio changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

First, let's parse the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—when spots cover part of the surface, they're cooler, so the star's overall brightness would decrease. But how does that affect the effective temperature? Hmm, because effective temperature is calculated based on the total luminosity. Oh wait, effective temperature is the temperature of a black body that would emit the same amount of radiation as the star. So if the star's surface has cooler spots, the overall Teff would be lower. That makes sense.

The question is about the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet. I think this is about the Boltzmann equation for population of energy levels.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The ratio in question is n1/n2, I think, because when the ratio decreases, that would mean n2/n1 is increasing. Wait, no, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So the ratio n_level1 / n_level2 (assuming level 1 is lower energy than level 2) would be higher at higher temperatures because higher T makes the exponential term less negative, so the ratio of higher energy level to lower increases.

Wait, let's get the ratio right. The
