Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about stars and their photospheric effective temperatures, specifically how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting, so the spots are cooler regions, I guess, because they're making the star emit less total energy.

Now, the key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes—when there are no spots versus when there are spots. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two states based on their energy difference and temperature.

The formula, if I recall correctly, is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K), and the ratio goes down. So, the ratio without spots (higher T) is higher than when spots are present (lower T).

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, but the overall photosphere's effective temperature is lower when spots are present. Wait, but how does that affect the individual regions? Hmm, maybe the photosphere is now a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So I guess the entire photosphere is considered to have that effective temperature when spots are present.

Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, the problem says the photosphere's effective temperature decreases. So the average temperature when spots are present is 5500 K, as opposed to 6000 K when spots are absent.

So, the photosphere's temperature is 6000 K normally and 5500 K when 40% is covered by spots. So, the effective temperature is the average, I suppose. So when the spots are present, the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Or perhaps it's a weighted average. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can model it as the effective temperature of the entire photosphere being 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower, which would affect the ratio.

Wait, but the transition is at 1448 Å—so that's in the near UV or visible? Let me think, 1448 Angstroms is about 0.1448 microns, which is in the near UV. Titanium lines are often in the UV, so that makes sense.

So the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. But since we're dealing with energy levels, the transition energy is E = hc/λ.

Wait, but for the Boltzmann factor, the difference in energy (E2 - E1) is hc/λ. So I can calculate that.

So first, let's compute E = hc / λ. Let's compute that in terms of eV or something manageable.

Planck constant h = 6.626e-34 J·s
Speed of light c = 3e8 m/s
Wavelength λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10)
Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Denominator: 1.448e-7 m
So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Convert Joules to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So E2 - E1 = 8.57 eV.

Wait, but this is the energy of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from level 2 to 1. So the energy difference is 8.57 eV.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. The transition from higher to lower energy emits a photon of energy E2 - E1. So if level 2 is higher than level 1, then E2 - E1 is positive. So when the electron drops from level 2 to 1, it emits a photon of energy E = (E2-E1) = 8.57 eV.

So the energy difference is 8.57 eV. But wait, that's a big energy difference for atomic transitions. Titanium's ionization energy is about 7.1 eV, so this is a higher energy than that, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the wavelength is 1448 angstroms? 1448 A is 144.8 nm, which is in the UV. So for a transition in Ti, which is a neutral atom, perhaps. Let me think: the ionization energy of Ti is around 7.1 eV, but transitions can be higher.

Wait, but in any case, the computation should be correct. Let me compute it again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m.

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10)
= (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) 
= 1.373e-18 J

Convert to eV: 1.373e-18 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Yes, that's correct. So E = 8.57 eV.

So the difference in energy is 8.57 eV.

Now, the Boltzmann factor is (E2-E1)/(k*T). Let's compute this for both T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

But wait, the ratio n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ). But since the problem is about the ratio changing, perhaps the statistical weights are the same, or perhaps they are part of the ratio. But since the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes, perhaps the statistical weights are constant, so the factor would be the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, the question is about the ratio when there are no spots (T=6000 K) divided by when there are spots (T=5500 K). So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -E/(k*5500) ) ] = exp( E/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Wait, because:

= exp( [ -E/(k*6000) + E/(k*5500) ] )
= exp( E/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

Simplify that:

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000)
= 500 / (5500 * 6000)
= 500 / 33,000,000
= 1 / 66,000

So the exponent becomes E/(k) * (1/66000 )

E is 8.57 eV. Let's convert that to Joules: 8.57 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = approx 9.955e4 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 9.955e4 K.

So the exponent is 9.955e4 / 66000 ≈ 9.955e4 / 6.6e4 ≈ 1.508.

So the factor is exp( 1.508 ) ≈ e^1.508.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is approximately 4.48, e^1.6 is about 4.95. So 1.508 is a bit less than 1.51, so
