Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters. Let me think. Oh wait, for a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of crystal structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, meaning all edges are equal and all angles are the same.

The interatomic distance here is given as 10 Angstrom. Oh wait, waitâ€”interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, which would be 'a' in a cubic system. But rhombohedral is a bit more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length, which I think is the same as the interatomic distance in this case. So a = 10 Angstrom.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Right, in a rhombohedral structure, all three angles are equal. So each is 30 degrees. 

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos(theta) )) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Another approach: the formula for d is (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk
