Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding resistance to anthracnose. Let me read through the problem again and see if I can break it down.

Alright, the setup is that they've done a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They knocked out each gene, making mutants g1, g2, g3. They also made double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. The goal is to determine the function of these genes based on their resistance to the anthracnose pathogen.

The results given are the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%. So, the wild type has 100% resistance. The mutants' resistances are as follows:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very low resistance)
- g2g3: 0% (again, no resistance)
- g1g2: 0% (no resistance)

Hmm, and the question is about what conclusion we can draw from this. The options are A to D, each suggesting different interactions between the genes, like which is a transcription factor, epistatic relationships, etc.

I remember that in genetics, when you have epistatic interactions, the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of gene B's mutation is masked when gene A is also mutated. Alternatively, the double mutant might have a more severe phenotype than either single mutant.

Looking at the results:

g2 alone has 0% resistance. That's a big effect. So when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests G2 might be a critical gene, perhaps a transcription factor since it's upstream of others. Because in the question, it's mentioned that at least one is a TF acting upstream.

The other single mutants: g1 is 75% (so some resistance left), g3 is 50%. So knocking out G1 or G3 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% → since both are knocked out, no resistance. So both g1 and g2 contribute to resistance. But since g2 alone is 0%, perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and something else, or maybe G2 is part of a pathway where without it, the other genes can't function.

- g1g3: 10% → so the double mutant is worse than either single. G1 alone is 75%, G3 alone is 50%, but together, it's 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway, possibly redundant, or maybe their functions are additive. Alternatively, maybe G3 is downstream of G1, so when both are knocked out, the effect is worse.

Wait, but g2g3 is 0% as well. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, no resistance. But G2 alone is already 0%, so adding G3 knockout doesn't change that. Hmm, maybe G3 is downstream of G2, but in another pathway.

Wait, another approach: think about epistatic relationships. If a double mutant doesn't show a more severe phenotype than the more severe single mutant, then the second gene is epistatic to the first.

Let's see:

What's the most severe single mutant? g2 is 0% resistance. So any double mutant that includes g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) is also 0%. So, when you add another mutation (g1 or g3), the resistance doesn't get worse than 0%, which is the same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Wait, no. Because in the case where a double mutant is more severe than either single, but if one of the singles is already the worst, the double can't be worse. So if g2 is 0%, then g1g2 and g2g3 being 0% doesn't give us more info. But looking at other double mutants, like g1g3, which is 10% worse than either G1 (75%) or G3 (50%) alone. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

Wait, but how about epistasis
