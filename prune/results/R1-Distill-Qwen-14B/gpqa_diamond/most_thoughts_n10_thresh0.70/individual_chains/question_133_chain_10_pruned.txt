Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, right, I remember that these are phosphate buffer solutions.

Wait, orthophosphate ions are HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? I think orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, because in the context of buffers, the different forms are involved. Yeah, I think that's right.

So, the problem gives me the masses of both salts. Each is 1.00 g. The volume is 200.00 cm³ which is 0.2 liters. I need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- ions.

First, I should probably calculate the moles of each salt. Let's do that. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 136 is approximately 0.00735 moles. Wait, more accurately, 136.09 is about 136.1, so 1 / 136.1 ≈ 0.007335 mol. Let's say approximately 0.007335 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Hmm, 177.99 is roughly 178. So 1/178 is about 0.00562 mol. Wait, actually, 177.99 is about 178, so 1 / 178 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

Wait, but I need to be precise here. Let me calculate:

For KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

Now, when these salts dissolve in water, what do they produce?

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O will dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water which probably stays as H2O. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4, and the H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-—so that's from the Na2HPO4·2H2O.

So the moles of HPO4^2- would be the moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is 0.005618 mol.

But wait, maybe there's a buffer system here. Because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^
