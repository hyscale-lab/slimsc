Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, let me think. I remember that SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) and includes higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're based on. The Standard Model respects certain symmetries.

Lorentz symmetry is definitely one. Because all the terms in the SM are Lorentz-invariant, so any effective theory built from it should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So operator terms in SMEFT should be Lorentz scalars. So option 1 is correct.

Then Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, which by definition includes local symmetry, so it includes Poincare symmetry. So operators must respect that. Option 2 is correct.

What about CP symmetry? Hmm, the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is present in the CKM matrix. So if SMEFT includes terms that go beyond the SM, would it necessarily respect CP? Probably not. The operators can violate CP unless they are forbidden by some symmetry. But wait, the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So maybe the SMEFT doesn
