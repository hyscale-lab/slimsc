Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the question.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E, which I need to identify from the given options. There are also some hints provided, which I should definitely consider.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:
a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the options, E is one of four cyclic ketones. So, the final step probably produces a ketone.

Let me think about each reaction step.

Starting with compound A. The IR peak at ~1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So A is probably a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But given the reactions, I think it's more likely a ketone. So A is a cyclic ketone, maybe.

Reaction 1: A with HCN gives B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups in a nucleophilic addition. So if A is a cyclic ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or something else. Let me think: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So compound B would be a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached adjacent? Or wait, no. The cyanide would add to the carbonyl, but in a cyclic ketone, that would form a cyclo structure.

Wait, but compound B is then reduced with H2 and Pd to give C. So B is probably a nitrile, because reducing nitriles with H2 and a catalyst (like Pd) would give an amine. Hmm, no, wait. Alternatively, if B is a secondary alcohol from cyanohydrin addition, but that doesn't seem to fit with the next steps.

Wait, maybe I got the first step wrong. Let me think: HCN adds to a ketone. The product of HCN addition to a ketone is a cyanohydrin, which is a geminal diol with a nitrile group. Wait, no, a cyanohydrin has the structure R-C(OH)-CN. So when a ketone (like cyclohexanone) reacts with HCN, you get a structure with an alcohol and a nitrile
