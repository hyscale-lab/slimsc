Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are also some hints provided, so I'll need to use them to figure out what's going on.

First, let's summarize the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are A to D, each a different cyclic ketone.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each part.

Starting with hint b. The IR peaks are important. A peak around 1750 cm^-1 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. But since the starting material is reacting with HCN (which is typically for ketones or aldehydes), I think compound A is a ketone. Because HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So A is a ketone. Then E, which has a peak at 1715, which is a bit lower, maybe a different carbonyl. I'll keep that in mind.

Now, reaction 1: A + HCN â†’ B. That's a nucleophilic addition, probably to a carbonyl, making a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, B would be a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached? Or wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol with an adjacent nitrile. So B would have an OH and CN groups next to each other on a carbon.

Reaction 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably adding H2 across a double bond or reducing a nitrile. Wait, but B is from the addition of HCN, which is an alcohol and a nitrile. So maybe B has a CH(OH)CN structure or something similar. Pd and H2 usually catalyze hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes, but nitriles can also be hydrogenated. Oh wait, nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and Pd become amines. So if B has a nitrile group, then C would have an amine group.

Wait, let me think again. So A is a ketone (IR peak), reacts with HCN to form B as a cyanohydrin. So the structure of B would have an alcohol group and a nitrile group attached to adjacent carbons. Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, the nitrile group (CN) would get reduced. Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines (CH2NH2) under certain conditions, but I think with H2 and Pd, perhaps it's catalytic hydrogenation which reduces nitriles to amines. Alternatively, maybe H2 in presence of Pd would reduce the nitrile to an amine. So then compound C would have an amine group where the nitrile was.

Wait, but then what about the next step. Reaction 3: C reacts with HNO2 to form D. HNO2 is nitrous acid, which usually is used for the formation of diazonium salts, but that's typically with aromatic amines. Alternatively, in aliphatic amines, HNO2 can lead to different products. Oh wait, if C is a secondary amine, then nitrous acid can cause it to undergo some kind of reaction like a Beckmann rearrangement,
