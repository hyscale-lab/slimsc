Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The student is performing an acid-catalyzed reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I'm supposed to pick the right reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the options provided.

Alright, let's break this down. So, the reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with compound A in the presence of a catalyst B, under heat and in a solvent. The product is this 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out what kind of reaction this is. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine with a five-membered ring. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine ring. So the structure is that of a pyrrolidine with a substituent that's a cyclohexane ring attached via a methylene group (like a bridge or a substituent).

Wait, the product structure looks like the pyrrolidine has a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane ring, but in a way that the cyclohexane is probably a bridge or a part of a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached. Wait, the name is cyclohexylidenemethyl, which sounds like a cyclohexene group connected via a methyl.

Wait, the term "cyclohexylidene" refers to a cyclohexene (a six-membered ring with a double bond). So, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the pyrrolidine has a substituent at position 1 which is a cyclohexene ring attached via a CH2 group.

So, how do we get from pyrrolidine to this product? I'm thinking about possible reactions that add a cyclohexene group to the pyrrolidine ring.

Oh, wait, this looks like a ring-expansion reaction or perhaps an alkylation. But considering the presence of acid as a catalyst, maybe it's an enamine formation or some kind of addition.

Wait, another thought: cyclo
