Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, which means distance d = 1/plx (but I think there's a parsec involved, but maybe the exact units don't matter here).

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that the number density of stars in space is constant. So the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. Let me think about how that relates to parallax.

If I imagine a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell would be 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between r and r+dr is approximately 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume, so n * 4πd² dr.

Now, parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let me express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because if d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) d plx. So I can substitute dr in terms of d plx.

So the number of stars in a shell with parallax plx to plx + d plx is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx^2)) d plx. Wait, the minus sign comes from the fact that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering a small range, perhaps I can ignore the sign because we're dealing with magnitudes, and just think about the absolute count.

So simplifying, the number of stars would be proportional to (1/plx²) * (d plx) * (1/plx²). Wait, let me compute this again. The volume is 4πd² dr. d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/(plx)^2. dr is (
