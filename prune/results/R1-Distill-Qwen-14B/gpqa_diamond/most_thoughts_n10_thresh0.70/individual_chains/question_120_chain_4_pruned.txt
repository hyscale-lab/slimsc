Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula is distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, so d = 1/plx. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases. Got it.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So how does this number change as parallax changes? Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their distances are spread out uniformly in some sense.

Wait, but wait—the distribution is uniform in the sky. So uniform in all directions, so maybe they're uniformly distributed in space. But how does that translate to parallax?

I think I need to relate the number of stars to their distances. Let's say the number of stars in a certain volume. But parallax relates to distance, so I should think in terms of how many stars are at a certain distance range.

Let me consider a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, assuming uniform distribution.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx, then plx p = 1/d. So if I have a small change in parallax, say dp, that corresponds to a change in distance dd. Let me see, since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dp. But since dp is a small positive change (as p increases, d decreases), the negative sign just indicates direction, but for volume, I think I can take the absolute value.

So the thickness in distance terms dr is d² dp, because dr = d² dp (since dd is negative, but the magnitude is d² dp).

Now the volume of the shell as a function of d is 4πd² dr. Substituting dr, that's 4πd² * d² dp = 4π d^4 dp. So the volume is 4π d^4 dp.

But wait, we want the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So for each dp, how many stars are there? Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So N ∝ 4π d^4 dp.

But I need to express this in terms of parallax p. Since p = 1/d, d = 1/p. Substituting d into the equation:

N ∝ 4π (1/p)^4 dp. Because d^4 is (1/p)^4, which is 1/p^4.

Wait, but N is the number of stars per unit parallax. So per unit dp, the number would be proportional to 1/p^4 times dp. But wait, the question is about number per unit range of parallax, so perhaps it's the number per unit dp.

Wait, no. Let me think again. We have N stars in a shell with par
