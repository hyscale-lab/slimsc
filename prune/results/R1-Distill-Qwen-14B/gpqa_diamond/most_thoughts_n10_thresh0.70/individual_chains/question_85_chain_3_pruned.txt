Okay, so I have this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I think is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )  Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, maybe it's scaled because the star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So, the star's luminosity is proportional to R_star² Teff⁴.

The planets' equilibrium temperature depends on the incident flux. Flux at the planet's orbit is L/(4πa²). So the equilibrium temperature is calculated as:

Te = ( (L) / (16 π² a²) )^(1/4) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4) )

Wait, but L is 4πR²σTeff⁴, so substituting that in:

Te = ( (4πR_star² σ Teff⁴) / (16 π
