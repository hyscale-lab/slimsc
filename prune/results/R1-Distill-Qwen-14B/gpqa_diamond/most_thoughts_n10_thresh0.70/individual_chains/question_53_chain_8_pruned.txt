Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. 

First, the IR spectrum shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters usually have strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The spectrum shows six signals. Let me break that down:

- Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons could be split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, each aromatic proton environment might be equivalent, but wait, that might not split into two. Or maybe the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two different sets of aromatic protons. Like maybe one substituent is meta to another, but wait, it's a di-substituted. Oh, wait, a di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. If they are para, then the aromatic protons are split into two sets: the two ortho to substituents, and the two meta. Wait, no, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two each. Wait, but if it's para, you have two sets of two protons each, but they are all equivalent in each set, so you would see two signals. That makes sense. So in that case, two aromatic signals.

Next, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet suggests that each proton has one neighboring proton (coupling with one proton). A doublet of quartets is a bit trickier. Maybe the vinyl group is adjacent to something else, perhaps a substituent that causes splitting. Or maybe it's part of an ester group.

Also, two signals for -CH3 groups. And no signals for -CH2 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups, but no methylene (CH2) groups. So the structure probably doesn't have any CH2 groups, which might suggest that any substituents are either single methyl groups or perhaps attached directly without CH2 in between.

Ok, so putting it all together, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring with an ester group. Let's think about possible structures.

Ester groups are typically R-O-CO-O-R, or more accurately, R-O-CO-R'. So for a benzene ring with an ester substituent, perhaps it's attached as a para-substituent. Wait, but if the benzene is di-substituted, the other substituent could be another alkyl group or another ester group, but that's less likely because it's an ester in the IR.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent group attached to the ring. For example, the substituents could be an est
