Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. 

Another part says that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. 

The question is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each part.

First, I'll try to figure out what Substance X is. Since X reacts with a liquid Y violently and releases gas W. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about common gases and their properties.

Wait, the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, if it's H2O, the molecule has 2+10=12 particles, but that's not the same as protons and neutrons per molecule. Wait, no, each molecule's composition. Let's think about a molecule where each atom has equal number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like CO2? No, that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic gas. Let's think about H2. But H has only one proton and one neutron in H2 (but wait, H usually has one proton and one neutron is deuterium. So H2 would have two H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and maybe 1 neutron if it's deuterium. So each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the molecule has 2*(1p, 1n) = total 2p and 2n. So the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. That fits. So gas W could be H2.

Wait, but when X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, and releases H2. So what reactions produce H2 gas? Common ones are metals reacting with acids. For example, metal reacting with HCl produces H2. So maybe Y is an acid, like HCl?

Wait, but X is incorporating a heavier isotope. So maybe X is a metal with a heavy isotope, perhaps something like a metal with a stable isotope that's heavier. Or perhaps it's a transition metal.

Wait, another thought: if X reacts with Y (liquid) to release H2, perhaps X is a metal like Mg or Zn. Let's think, Mg reacting with HCl: Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2↑. So that fits. So Y is an acid, HCl maybe.

But wait, the precipitate G forms. So when Mg reacts with HCl, you get MgCl2 solution, which is clear. But if Y is a different acid, maybe another reaction occurs. Alternatively, if Y is water, but that's not an acid.
