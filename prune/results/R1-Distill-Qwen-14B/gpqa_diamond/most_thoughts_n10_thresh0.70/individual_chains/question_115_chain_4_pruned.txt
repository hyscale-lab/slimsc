Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

So, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors mean their velocities are significant fractions of the speed of light. So, I should probably use relativistic equations here. But photons are massless, so when they're produced, energy and momentum conservation will be key.

Let me recall that in annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the electron and positron are moving along the same line, the initial collision is head-on. So the system's total momentum must be considered.

First, I think I should compute the total energy and momentum before the collision of the electron and positron. Then, apply conservation laws to find the properties of the photons.

Electron and positron have equal rest mass, but their Lorentz factors are different. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, for the electron, gamma_e =4, and for the positron, gamma_p=2.

Wait, but which direction do they move? The electron is moving left to right (from the left), and the positron is moving right to left (from the right). So their velocities are in opposite directions. So their momenta will be opposite in direction.

Hmm. So I should find the momentum vectors of each and add them to get the total initial momentum.

The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. But for the direction, one is positive (electron moving right) and the other is negative (positron moving left). Wait, but wait. The electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is in the positive direction. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is negative because it's moving towards the left. Wait no, the positron is moving from the right towards the left. So yes, their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right, the positron is moving to the left. So their velocities are opposite. So their momenta would have opposite signs.

So let's define the positive direction as to the right. So the electron has momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since it's moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So p_p would be negative.
