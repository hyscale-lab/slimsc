Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound's FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an O-CO-O or more accurately, an ester functional group. The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals, which correspond to different types of hydrogens. Let's break down the information.

First, the structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene. The substituents could be anything, but given the IR and NMR data, I need to figure out what they are.

Looking at the NMR data:

1. Two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons can be split into different environments. But wait, two signals might indicate a certain symmetry. For example, in para substitution, the two sets of aromatic protons are equivalent. Or maybe it's an ortho or meta substitution, but that would give more signals. Hmm, but wait, the compound is di-substituted, so benzene has two substituents. Let's think about the substitution pattern.

In a para-substituted di-substituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite each other. The aromatic protons would be in two sets: the two H's adjacent to one substituent (ortho positions) and the two H's adjacent to the other substituent (but wait, no, in para, the substituents are opposite, so the aromatic H's would be in two sets. Let me think: if the substituents are para, the two adjacent H's to each substituent are equivalent. So the aromatic ring would have two equivalent sets of two H each. So the NMR would show two signals for the aromatic H's. That makes sense with the given data.

2. Two signals correspond to vinyl-H. Vinyl H's are typically those attached to double bonds, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let's think about what structures would have vinyl H's. Maybe an ester group with a substituent that has a double bond. For example, if one substituent is an ester and the other is an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents themselves have double bonds.

Wait, the di-substituted benzene could have two groups attached. One is an ester, and the other is perhaps a vinyl group. Or maybe both substituents are esters, but that doesn't seem right since the IR only shows an ester.

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered ring. So benzene with two substituents. Let's think about possible structures. Let's assume one substituent is an ester group. Like OCOOR. The other substituent might be an ethenyl group (vinyl).

Wait, but in the NMR, the vinyl H's are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Let me think about possible coupling. For
