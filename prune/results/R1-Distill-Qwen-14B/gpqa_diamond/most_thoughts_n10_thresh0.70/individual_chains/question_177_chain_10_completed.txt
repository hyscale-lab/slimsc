Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my black body radiation and star properties, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than Star_2. But wait, mass might not be directly relevant here unless it's about something like the star's temperature. But the problem states that the stars are radiating as black bodies, so I'm thinking the key factors are radius, temperature, and maybe velocity? 

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. That's a crucial point.

Now, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity... how does that affect observed quantities like luminosity? Oh, right! When a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift in the observed wavelengths. Since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is pretty fast, maybe that affects the observed temperature or the measured luminosity.

But wait, the problem says the brightness peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are considered after Doppler shift. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. So I think that this is the observed wavelength. So for each star, their maximum emission in their rest frame would be shifted due to their velocity when observed from Earth.

Wait, no. Because the problem says that when they did the spectroscopy, the observed wavelengths where the stars were brightest were the same. So considering Doppler shift, the observed λ_max would be affected by their velocities.

So for each star, their rest frame λ_max is determined by their actual temperatures. But the observed λ_max is measured by the astronomers. So for Star_1, which has zero radial velocity, the observed λ_max is the same as its rest frame λ_max. So T1 = b / λ_max observed for Star_1.

Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away or towards us, that would shift the observed λ_max. Let's think about the Doppler effect formula. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) when v_r is positive for moving away. Wait, no, the exact formula can vary based on the approximation. Let me think.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + (v_r/c)) / (1 - (v_r/c)) )

But wait, if the source is moving away (v_r positive), then the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If moving towards (v_r negative), observed wavelength is shorter (blue shifted).

Wait, but in this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But we don't know the direction. Hmm, but the problem says the observed λ_max for both stars are the same. So the Doppler shift from Star_2's velocity must adjust its λ_max to match Star_1's observed λ_max.

Wait, let me clarify. Star_1: radial velocity 0. So observed λ_max = λ1_rest (because no shift). Star_2: radial velocity 700 km/s. So its observed λ_max would be λ2_rest * Doppler factor. But since both observed λ_max are same, λ1_rest = λ2_observed.

Wait, no. Wait, Star_1's observed λ_max is λ1_rest (since v=0). Star_2's observed λ_max is λ2_rest multiplied by Doppler factor. But both observed λ_max are same. So λ1_rest = λ2_observed.

But λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2. But we know that T1 = T2 because λ1_rest = λ2_rest? Wait, no. Because Star_2's λ2_rest is shifted by its velocity when observed. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's denote:

- For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v1 = 0)
- For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * Doppler_factor(v2)

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * Doppler_factor(v2)

Hmm, but λ1_rest is the rest wavelength for Star_1, which is b / T1. Similarly, λ2_rest is b / T2. So if T1 = T2, then λ1_rest = λ2_rest. But in that case, Doppler_factor(v2) would have to be 1, which would imply v2 is zero, but Star_2 has v2=700. So this can't be right. Therefore, perhaps T1 is not equal to T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the peak wavelengths would be the same when considering their rest frames because they are the same when observed. But that may not be the case because of the Doppler shift. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_rest. For Star_2, λ2_obs = Doppler_shifted λ2_rest. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So λ1_rest = Doppler_shifted λ2_rest.

But λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So, T1_rest = b / λ1_rest, T2_rest = b / λ2_rest.

But considering the Doppler shift, the observed temperature isn't the same as the rest temperature. Hmm, perhaps I need to find how the observed flux relates to the intrinsic luminosity and the velocity.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the luminosity formula. The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

But wait, the observed luminosity (apparent brightness) also depends on distance. However, the problem is talking about the intrinsic luminosity, I think, since it says "computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2". So maybe the distance isn't a factor here. Or perhaps the problem is considering the stars as having the same distance, but that's not stated. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem is about their computed luminosities, not observed brightness. So regardless of distance, they calculated their luminosities based on their properties. So perhaps the Doppler effect comes into play for determining their temperatures, which affects the luminosity calculation.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me outline the steps:

1. The stars are black bodies. So their luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

2. The observed peak wavelength λ_obs relates to the rest frame λ_rest via the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity.

3. The problem states that the observed λ_max (λ_obs) for both stars is the same. So:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But λ1_obs is λ1_rest (since Star_1's radial velocity is 0). So λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs is λ2_rest multiplied by the Doppler factor.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * D,

where D is the Doppler factor.

But from Wien's law,

λ_rest = b / T_rest.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * D.

So,

T1 = T2 / D.

But D depends on the velocity. Let me calculate D.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), assuming non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, but the exact formula can vary. Let me think about it. The relativistic Doppler effect formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But that's when the source is moving away. If moving towards, v is negative, so the denominator would change.

Alternatively, another approximation is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) when v << c. But 700 km/s is about 0.0023c (since c is ~3e5 km/s), so perhaps it's okay to use the approximation.

Wait, let's compute v/c:

v = 700 km/s

c = 3e5 km/s ≈ 300,000 km/s

v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333... So about 0.233% of c.

So non-relativistic, so approximation should work.

So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is longer.

So λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c).

But if Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ2_obs would be shorter. But the problem says the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1's. So let's see.

Wait, Star_1 has v=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Star_2 has v=700 km/s. So if it's moving away, λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/3e5) = λ2_rest * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 * λ2_rest.

But Star_1's observed λ is λ1_rest. So if λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = 1.002333 * λ2_rest.

But, from Wien's law, λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = 1.002333 * (b / T2)

Simplify:

1/T1 = 1.002333 / T2

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002333 ≈ T1 * (1 + 0.002333)

So T2 is slightly higher than T1, because λ_obs for Star_2 is longer (if moving away), which implies lower temperature. Wait, wait, no. Because λ_obs is longer, but λ_rest is shorter? Wait, perhaps I should think again.

If Star_2 is moving away, Doppler shift makes λ_obs longer. So λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

But since λ_obs is same as Star_1's λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c)

λ1_rest = (λ2_rest) * 1.002333.

But λ_rest is inversely proportional to T. So,

T1 = b / λ1_rest

T2 = b / λ2_rest

So,

T1 = (b) / ( (b / T2) * 1.002333 )

Hmm, maybe that's complicated. Let's substitute λ2_rest = b / T2 into the equation.

So,

λ1_rest = (b/T2) * 1.002333

But λ1_rest is also b / T1.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.002333

Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = 1.002333

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002333

Therefore, T2 is about 0.2333% higher than T1.

So, T2 is approximately T1.

Wait, but that's a very small difference. So maybe the temperature difference is negligible, but perhaps we shouldn't approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact Doppler shift formula for λ_obs.

The exact Doppler formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, wait. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

Assuming v_r is positive when moving away.

So in this case, Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s (assuming moving away). So,

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + 700/3e5 ) / (1 - 700/3e5 ) )

Compute 700/3e5: 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333...

So,

(1 + 0.0023333) = 1.0023333

(1 - 0.0023333) = 0.9976667

So,

sqrt( (1.0023333) / (0.9976667) ) = sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.002337

So,

λ2_obs ≈ λ2_rest * 1.002337

So, λ2_obs ≈ 1.002337 * λ2_rest

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.002337

But from Wien's law,

λ1_rest = b / T1

λ2_rest = b / T2

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 1.002337

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1.002337) / T2

So,

T2 = T1 * 1.002337

Again, same conclusion: T2 is about 0.2337% higher than T1.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002337. So approximately, T2 is 0.2337% higher than T1.

So the temperature of Star_2 is a bit higher than that of Star_1.

Now, the problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. The luminosity is given by L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So, L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ (T1)^4

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4

We need to compute L1 / L2.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = [ (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 ) ]

Wait, because:

(L1/L2) = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) ) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( (T1/(T2) )^4 )

We have R1/R2 = 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T1/T2 = 1 / (1.002337) ≈ 0.997663.

So,

(0.997663)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

0.997663 ≈ 1 - 0.002337.

So, (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4. For small x, higher terms can be neglected.

x = 0.002337

So,

(0.997663)^4 ≈ 1 -4(0.002337) = 1 - 0.009348 = 0.990652

But let's compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.997663^4:

First, compute 0.997663^2:

0.997663 * 0.997663 = ?

Let me compute:

997.663 * 997.663 = (1000 - 2.337)^2 = 1000² - 2 *1000 *2.337 + (2.337)^2 = 1e6 - 4674 + 5.461 = approximately 995331.461.

Wait, but that's in terms of 10^-3. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute it numerically.

Alternatively, use logarithms or exponents.

Alternatively, compute 0.997663 * 0.997663.

= (1 - 0.002337)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002337 + 0.002337² = 1 - 0.004674 + 0.00000546 ≈ 0.99533146.

Wait, that's 0.995331.

Now, square that to get to the 4th power.

So, 0.995331^2.

Again, (1 - 0.004669)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004669 + (0.004669)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009338 + 0.0000218 ≈ 0.9906838.

So approximately 0.99068.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99068.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.99068) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99068 ≈ ?

Calculate 2.25 * 0.99068.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.00068 = approx 0.00153.

So total ≈ 2.2275 + 0.00153 ≈ 2.229.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake because I'm approximating the fourth power as 0.99068, but the actual value might be a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.997663^4.

Compute step by step:

First, compute 0.997663 squared:

0.997663 * 0.997663.

Let's compute:

= (1 - 0.002337)^2

= 1 - 2*0.002337 + (0.002337)^2

= 1 - 0.004674 + 0.00000546 ≈ 0.99533146.

Now, square that (to get 0.99533146^2):

= (0.99533146)^2

= (1 - 0.00466854)^2

= 1 - 2*(0.00466854) + (0.00466854)^2

= 1 - 0.00933708 + 0.00002179

= 0.99068471.

So, (0.997663)^4 ≈ 0.99068471.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.99068471) = 2.25 * 0.99068471 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.99068471.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99068471.

= (2 * 0.99068471) + (0.25 * 0.99068471)

= 1.98136942 + 0.2476711775 ≈ 2.2290405975.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking back at the options, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

So 2.229 is closest to option D, which is ~2.23.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift factor, because I assumed Star_2 is moving away, but if it's moving towards, the observed wavelength would be shorter, which would imply a higher temperature.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. But it doesn't specify the direction. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then its Doppler shift would be blueshifted, so λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c).

Wait, no, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right.

The general Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer (v positive when moving away) is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

So if the source is moving towards us, v is negative, so the denominator becomes (1 - v/c) where v is negative, which is (1 + |v|/c).

Wait, perhaps I should re-derive it.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( [ (1 + v/c) ] / [1 - v/c ] )

But v is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards.

So if Star_2 is moving towards us, then v is -700 km/s.

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - 700/3e5) / (1 + 700/3e5) )

Compute this:

(1 - 0.0023333) / (1 + 0.0023333 ) = (0.9976667) / (1.0023333 ) ≈ 0.995334.

sqrt(0.995334) ≈ 0.997666.

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * 0.997666.

In this case, since Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is shorter than its rest λ.

Now, since Star_1 has λ_obs = λ_rest (v=0), and Star_2's λ_obs is λ_rest * 0.997666, but the problem states that their observed λ_max is the same.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

But λ2_obs = λ2_rest * 0.997666.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 0.997666.

Again, from Wien's law,

λ1_rest = b / T1,

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * 0.997666.

Cancel b,

1 / T1 = 0.997666 / T2.

So,

T2 = T1 * 0.997666.

Which means T2 is lower than T1 by about 0.2333%.

So now, in this scenario, T2 < T1.

Wait, so when Star_2 is moving towards us, our observed λ_max is smaller than its rest λ_max, which implies a higher temperature (since λ_max is inversely proportional to T). But if the observed λ_max is same as Star_1's, which is at rest, then if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is smaller, so T2 is higher than T1. Wait, that's the opposite of the previous scenario.

Wait, no, let's do the math again.

If Star_2 is moving towards us,

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

v is negative, so:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + |v|/c)/(1 - |v|/c) )

Wait, no. Let me think again.

When the source is moving towards the observer, v is negative. So,

(1 + v/c) becomes (1 - |v|/c),

and (1 - v/c) becomes (1 + |v|/c).

So,

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - |v|/c) / (1 + |v|/c) )

Which is less than 1, so λ_obs < λ_rest, which implies the observed wavelength is shorter, which would imply higher temperature (since λ ~ 1/T).

So, in this case, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is less than its rest λ, so its observed temperature is higher than its rest temperature. But wait, the observed temperature is higher than its actual temperature?

Wait, no, the actual temperature is T2. The observed wavelength is shorter, λ_obs, which implies T_obs = b / λ_obs > T2.

So, the observed temperature would be higher than the actual temperature.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max is same for both stars. So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ is smaller, so T_obs for Star_2 is higher, but for Star_1, T_obs is the same as its actual T1.

Wait, but this might complicate things. Perhaps the problem assumes that the temperatures are the same? No, because earlier I thought that because the observed λ_max is same, their temperatures would be the same, but that's only true if there's no Doppler shift. But because of the Doppler shift, their actual temperatures could differ.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this from a different angle.

The key is that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, which allows us to relate their temperatures and velocities.

Let me denote:

For Star_1:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v1=0)

For Star_2:

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * D,

where D is Doppler factor.

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = D * λ2_rest.

But from Wien's law,

λ1_rest = b / T1,

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = D * (b/T2)

Simplify,

T2 = D * T1.

So,

T2 = D * T1.

Now, depending on whether Star_2 is moving towards or away, D will be greater than or less than 1.

If Star_2 is moving away (D > 1), then T2 = D * T1 > T1.

If Star_2 is moving towards (D < 1), then T2 = D * T1 < T1.

But in either case, we have this relation.

Now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4) )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2,

= ( (1.5)^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (T1 / T2 )^4.

But from earlier, T2 = D * T1.

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / D.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1/D)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / D^4.

Now, the Doppler factor D is given by the Doppler shift.

We have to compute D based on Star_2's velocity.

But the problem is, we don't know if Star_2 is moving towards or away. So perhaps, we can compute D in both cases and see which one gives a value close to the options.

Wait, but the problem says that Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but doesn't specify direction. Hmm.

Wait, the radial velocity for Star_2 is 700 km/s. Radial velocity is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume it's moving away, but it's unclear.

Wait, but in the first scenario, where Star_2 is moving away, D is 1.002337, so L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1.002337)^4 ≈ 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.228.

In the second scenario, where Star_2 is moving towards, D would be 0.997666.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / (0.997666)^4.

Compute (0.997666)^4.

As before, (0.997666)^2 ≈ 0.995331.

Then, (0.995331)^2 ≈ 0.990684.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 0.990684 ≈ 2.27.

Wait, 2.25 / 0.990684 ≈ 2.27?

Wait, 2.25 / 0.990684 ≈ ?

Well, 2.25 / 0.99 = approximately 2.2727.

So, 2.2727. That's about 2.27.

Looking at the options, option C is ~2.35, which is higher than 2.27.

But in this scenario, the ratio is 2.27, which is closest to option D (2.23) and option B (2.32).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, when Star_2 is moving towards us, D is less than 1, which makes T2 = D * T1.

So, T2 is lower than T1. So Star_1 has a higher temperature. So, L1 would be larger.

Wait, but L1/L2 = 2.25 / (D)^4.

If D is 0.997666,

D^4 = (0.997666)^4 ≈ 0.990684.

So,

2.25 / 0.990684 ≈ 2.272.

So, 2.272 is approximately 2.27, which isn't exactly in the options. Hmm.

But the options given are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So, 2.27 is between B and D. But perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me compute D more accurately.

D is the Doppler factor for Star_2 when it's moving towards us.

The exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )

v = 700 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.00233333...

So,

(1 - v/c) = 1 - 0.00233333 = 0.99766667

(1 + v/c) = 1 + 0.00233333 = 1.00233333

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.99766667 / 1.00233333 ≈ 0.995334.

Square root of that is sqrt(0.995334) ≈ 0.997666.

So, D ≈ 0.997666.

So, D^4 ≈ (0.997666)^4.

Compute (0.997666)^2:

= 0.997666 * 0.997666.

Let me compute this accurately.

0.997666 * 0.997666:

= (1 - 0.002334)^2

= 1 - 2*(0.002334) + (0.002334)^2

= 1 - 0.004668 + 0.000005449

= 0.995336449.

Now, (0.995336449)^2:

= (1 - 0.004663551)^2

= 1 - 2*(0.004663551) + (0.004663551)^2

= 1 - 0.009327102 + 0.000021757

= 0.990693655.

So, D^4 ≈ 0.990693655.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 0.990693655 ≈ ?

2.25 / 0.990693655 = ?

Let me compute this:

0.990693655 ≈ 0.9906937.

Compute 2.25 / 0.9906937.

Well, 2.25 ÷ 0.9906937 ≈ ?

Well, 0.9906937 is approximately 0.9907.

So,

2.25 / 0.9907 = ?

Let me compute:

2.25 ÷ 0.9907.

= (2.25 * 1e4) ÷ 9907 ≈ 22500 / 9907 ≈ ?

Wait, 9907 * 2.27 = ?

Wait, 9907 * 2 = 19814.

9907 * 0.27 = 2674.89.

Total 19814 + 2674.89 = 22488.89.

So, 2.27 * 9907 ≈ 22488.89.

But 2.25 * 1e4 is 22500.

So, 22500 - 22488.89 = 11.11.

So, 11.11 / 9907 ≈ 0.00112.

So, approximately, 2.27 + 0.00112 ≈ 2.2711.

So, L1/L2 ≈ 2.271.

The options don't have 2.27, but option D is 2.23, which is close but not exact.

Wait, but I'm probably missing something. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So our calculation gives approximately 2.27, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the direction of Star_2's velocity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the temperature used in the luminosity calculation. Because the luminosity is an intrinsic property, not the observed one.

Wait, no, the problem says, "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So the astronomers compute L based on their own properties, not the observed ones. So, perhaps the observed wavelength doesn't affect the calculation of L, but the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, which is used to compute L.

Wait, no, no. The luminosity is an intrinsic property, calculated as L = 4π R^2 σ T^4. So to compute L, you need the actual temperature, not the observed temperature.

But how do the astronomers determine T? They measure the peak wavelength, which is λ_obs. So they would infer T_obs = b / λ_obs. But the actual T is different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, that's an important point. So if the astronomers observe λ_obs and assume it's the rest wavelength (i.e., that there's no Doppler shift), then their T would be incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that they computed the luminosities based on their properties. So perhaps they measured the actual λ_rest, which doesn't require knowing the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ_max is same, which is the same as the observed λ_max for both stars. So perhaps the temperatures they compute are based on the observed λ_max, implying that they have accounted for the Doppler shift.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the way the problem is structured, the luminosity is computed based on the observed λ_max. So, perhaps the temperatures used in the luminosity calculation are those derived from the observed λ_max.

In that case, for Star_1, λ_obs = λ1_rest, so T1 = b / λ1_obs.

For Star_2, λ_obs = λ2_rest * D, so T2 = b / (λ2_rest * D) = (b / λ2_rest) * (1/D) = T2_rest * (1/D).

Wait, but earlier we had λ1_rest = D * λ2_rest.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let's think again.

If the astronomers compute luminosity, they probably use the observed flux and distance, but the problem says they computed the luminosity based on their properties (radius and mass), but maybe they also use the observed peak wavelength to find temperature.

Wait, let me read the problem again.

"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. [...] Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, they used the observed wavelengths (which are same) to compute the temperatures, I think.

So, for each star, T = b / λ_obs.

So, T1 = b / λ_obs,

T2 = b / λ_obs.

So, T1 = T2.

Because λ_obs is same for both.

Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider earlier. If the wavelength at which they appear brightest is the same, then the observed λ_max is same.

So, using Wien's law, the observed temperature would be same for both stars.

So, T1_obs = T2_obs = b / λ_obs.

But the actual temperatures are different due to the Doppler shift.

So,

For Star_1: T1_obs = T1_rest.

Because λ_obs = λ_rest.

For Star_2: T2_obs = T2_rest / D.

Wait, because λ_obs = λ_rest * D.

So,

T_obs = b / λ_obs = (b / λ_rest) * 1/D = T_rest * (1/D).

So, for Star_2, T_obs = T2_rest / D.

But the problem states that T_obs is same for both, so T1_obs = T2_obs.

So,

T1_rest = T2_rest / D.

So,

T2_rest = T1_rest * D.

But D is the Doppler factor for Star_2.

Hmm, but earlier we had different scenarios based on the direction of velocity.

Wait, let's think.

If Star_2 is moving away:

D = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ≈ 1 + v/(2c) (using approximation for small v).

But more accurately, for v<<c.

So, D ≈ 1 + (v/c).

But earlier, considering v=700 km/s, which is 0.002333 c.

So, D ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T2_rest = T1_rest * 1.002333.

So,

T2_rest ≈ 1.002333 * T1_rest.

So, the actual temperature of Star_2 is higher than that of Star_1.

So,

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1_rest^4,

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2_rest^4.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2,

T2_rest = 1.002333 * T1_rest.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) ) = (2.25) * (1 / (1.002333)^4 )

Compute (1.002333)^4.

Approximately, using binomial expansion:

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 +4x +6x² +4x³ +x^4, where x =0.002333.

So,

≈ 1 +4*(0.002333) +6*(0.002333)^2 +4*(0.002333)^3 + (0.002333)^4.

Compute each term:

4x = 0.009332.

6x² =6*(5.44e-6 )= 3.264e-5.

4x³≈4*(1.26e-8 )=5.04e-8.

x^4≈2.84e-11.

Adding all terms:

1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

Plus 3.264e-5 ≈ 1.009365.

Plus 5.04e-8 ≈ 1.009365005.

Plus 2.84e-11 ≈ 1.0093650055.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.23.

So, the factor is approximately 2.23, option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and the relationships between luminosity, radius, temperature, and Doppler shift.

### Key Information and Assumptions:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius of Star_1: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
   - Mass of Star_1: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity).
   - Radial velocity of Star_1: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - Radial velocity of Star_2: \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Observed Wavelengths**:
   - The observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) for both stars are the same. This implies that the Doppler shift must adjust the rest wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)) of the stars to match the observed wavelength.

3. **Luminosity Formula**:
   - Luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
   - The luminosity ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
     \]

4. **Doppler Shift**:
   - The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
     \]
   - For small velocities (\( v \ll c \)), this simplifies to:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{rest}} (1 + v/c)
     \]
   - For Star_2, moving away at \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the Doppler factor is:
     \[
     D = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}} \approx 1 + \frac{v_2}{2c}
     \]
     Substituting \( v_2/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \), we find:
     \[
     D \approx 1.002333
     \]

5. **Temperature Relationship**:
   - From Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed wavelengths are the same:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot D
     \]
     Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T \), we get:
     \[
     T_1 = T_2 / D \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_2 = D \cdot T_1
     \]

### Luminosity Ratio Calculation:
Using the luminosity formula:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
\]
Substitute \( R_1 / R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_2 = D \cdot T_1 \):
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left( \frac{1}{D} \right)^4
\]
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{D^4}
\]
Substitute \( D = 1.002333 \):
\[
D^4 \approx (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00937
\]
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.00937} \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately **2.23**.
