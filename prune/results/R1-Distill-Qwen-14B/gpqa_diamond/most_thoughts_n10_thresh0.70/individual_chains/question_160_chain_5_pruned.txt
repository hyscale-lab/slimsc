Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength Î» is shining straight along the z-axis onto this aperture. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field region when N is infinitely large. Oh, and they mention that angles are small, so I can approximate tan(theta) as theta. 

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a certain angle, but this is a polygon, which complicates things a bit.

Wait, but when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. Oh wait, but wait, the apothem is the same for all sides. So the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the radius (the distance from center to a vertex) is different. But in the limit as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem? Or is it the other way around? Oh, no, wait. For a regular polygon, as N becomes very large, the apothem approaches the radius of the circumscribed circle. So if all apothems are length 'a', when N is huge, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'. So maybe I can model this as a circular aperture problem.

Wait, but the question says when N is infinitely large, so the shape is a circle with apothem 'a', so the radius would be 'a'. Because in a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So if the polygon is becoming a circle, the radius would be 'a'. So the problem reduces to the single-slit diffraction scenario but for a circular aperture.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, for a single slit, the diffraction pattern is different from a circular aperture. A circular aperture would have a central maximum and then minima at certain angles. But the single-slit pattern is more like the first minimum at a specific
