Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in space, not clustered. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx, like 1/plx^4, 1/plx^2, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us because plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a star at distance d has a parallax of 1/d parsecs.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think implies that the number density of stars is constant in space. So, number density n is the same everywhere.

But wait, when we look at stars, we see more of them at certain distances because of how volume works. Let me think: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr, since the number density is n per unit volume.

But the question is about parallax plx. Since plx = 1/d, I can substitute d = 1/plx. So, let's express everything in terms of plx. The shell's thickness in terms of plx would be, well, if d changes by dr, then plx changes by d plx = - (1/d²) dr, because plx = 1/d. So, dr = -d² plx dd, but maybe I'm mixing variables here. Alternatively, when plx increases (since parallax is larger for closer stars), the distance decreases. So for a small change in plx, d plx, the corresponding distance change dr is negative, but in terms of magnitude, I can write dr = (1/(plx^2)) d plx. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, let me correct that. The relation between plx and d is d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by a small amount d plx, then d changes by d d = - (1/plx
