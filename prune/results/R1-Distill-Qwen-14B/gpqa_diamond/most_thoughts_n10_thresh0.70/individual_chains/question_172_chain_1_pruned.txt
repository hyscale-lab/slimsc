Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's think this through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the population of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann equation is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations, g is the statistical weights, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Since the question specifies a specific energy level, I think the statistical weights g_i and g_j might be the same, so they could cancel out. Or maybe not, but the question mentions 'a specific energy level' which might imply that the transition is between two levels, but perhaps the statistical weights are the same for both, or perhaps it's a ratio that's given. Wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so the ratio is 2.

So let me define the variables. Let's say E is the energy difference between the two levels, which is given as 1.38e-23 J. In star_1, the excitation level is higher, so n1_upper / n1_lower = 2, and in star_2, n2_upper / n2_lower = 1 (since star_1 is twice as excited as star_2). Or wait, maybe star_2 has lower excitation, so n2_upper / n2_lower = 1? Wait, no, because star_1 has twice as excited, which means their ratio is higher. So for star 1: n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2), but wait, no, because star_2 is the one with lower excitation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the ratios for each star separately. For star_1, the ratio is (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = 2. For star_2, it's (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = let's say x. But the problem states that star_1's level is twice as excited as star_2's, so maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or perhaps the number is 2 times higher.

Wait, the first part of the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2's. So the excitation level is higher in star_1, meaning more atoms are in the upper energy level. So for star_1, the ratio (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) is higher than for star_2.

But wait, the energy difference E is the same for both stars because it's the same transition in iron. So E is same for both.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for each star, which they probably are because it's the same transition in the same element. So the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

For star 1: (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = exp( - E/(k T1) )

For star 2: (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = exp( - E/(k T2) )

But the problem states that (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2)/(n_lower2). So putting it together:

exp( - E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - E/(k T2) )

Wait, is that correct? Because star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's. So yeah, that equation.
