Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, and it's about the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature via something called the Boltzmann equation. Let me think through this.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, that probably means the excitation is higher, so their population in a higher energy state is more. So the ratio of the number of excited atoms to unexcited is higher in star_1.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think that's ΔE. And the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies here.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k*T) )

But wait, since the energy difference is given as a specific value, maybe we can assume that the statistical weights (g factors) are the same for both stars? Or perhaps the problem is simplified so that g_upper/g_lower is 1, so it doesn't affect the ratio. Or maybe the problem is comparing two states where g isn't a factor.

Wait, in the question, it's the same energy level being considered for both stars. So for each star, the excitation is measured in the same energy level compared to another. So the g factors would be the same in both cases, so they cancel out when taking the ratio of star_1 to star_2.

The problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2)

Using the Boltzmann equation, for each star:

n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE / (k T1) )

n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( -ΔE / (k T2) )

So the ratio (n_upper1/n_lower1) / (n_upper2/n_lower2) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Because when you take the ratio, it's the exponents subtracting.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, wait. Let me re-derive that.

Taking the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors:

(n_upper1/n_lower1) / (n_upper2/n_lower2) = [ exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) )

Factor out ΔE/(k): exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So 2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural log of both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but wait, the energy ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J.
