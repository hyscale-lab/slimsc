Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ and forms a complex. The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the formation constant. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, the formation constant (K) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh right, that's the general idea.

In this problem, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. I think that's the initial concentration, assuming that the complex doesn't dissociate much. But wait, the K is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is quite stable. That would mean that the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So I need to find [Ca²+].

Let me write down what I know:

K = 5e10 = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But since the solution is stoichiometric, I think that the initial concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are such that they form the complex in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but wait: when you have a solution that's just the complex, the free [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] will be determined by the dissociation of the complex. Because the complex is in solution, and it's in equilibrium.

So the total concentration of the complex
