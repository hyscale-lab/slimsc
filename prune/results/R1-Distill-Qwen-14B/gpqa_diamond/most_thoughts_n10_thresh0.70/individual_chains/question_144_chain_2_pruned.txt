Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here. It's about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonance... oh, right, that's when a particle is treated as a temporary state, like in particle physics when they talk about unstable particles with a very short lifetime.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X. I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh yeah, the formula should be something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But wait, velocity for a relativistic particle? Probably close to the speed of light, so maybe we can approximate it as c.

So the given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Hmm, the width relates to the particle's lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I remember that the natural linewidth is given by Γ ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait. Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. That makes sense.

But first, I need to figure out the lifetime τ of the meson. Once I have that, I can find the decay distance by multiplying by the particle's speed, which is approximately c, since it's much faster than typical speeds we deal with.

So let's break this down step by step.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units are crucial here. All the energies should be in compatible units. Let me see. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant in units involving seconds would be in those terms.

Wait, let's confirm the value of ħ in GeV·s. I think I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So yes.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, but that's in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 Ge
