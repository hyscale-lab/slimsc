Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. We're supposed to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, the components are given as matrices. So P is a vector operator, right? So the operator P is given by P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But wait, the direction is along an arbitrary unit vector n in the x-z plane. Oh, because n is in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So the direction is along a vector like (a, 0, b), but since it's a unit vector, a^2 + b^2 = 1.

But wait, so the operator we're interested in is the operator P along direction n. So that would be P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So the operator becomes P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. So we're to find the eigenvector of P · n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvectors of spin operators in different directions are related to the direction of the spin. Since the muon has spin-1/2, the eigenstates will correspond to spin-up or spin-down along the direction n.

Hmm, but the question is about the eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors of P · n will be along the n direction, so the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

But the options given are in terms of components, not necessarily in the x, y, z directions. Let me think about how to construct the eigenvector.

Wait, each component of P is given:

Px is ħ/2 times [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is ħ/2 times [[0
