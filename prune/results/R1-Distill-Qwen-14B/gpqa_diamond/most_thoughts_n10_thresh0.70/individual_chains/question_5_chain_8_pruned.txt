Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question mentions a quantum mechanical operator P, which is a vector operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the observable is measured.

The components of the operator P are given for X, Y, and Z. Let me write them down:

- P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. That makes sense because spin-1/2 systems use 2x2 matrices.

The operator vector P is given as P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y must be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1.

So the operator P becomes P = n_x P_x + 0*P_y + n_z P_z.

Let me compute that. Let's substitute the matrices:

P = n_x (ħ/2 [ [0,1], [1,0] ]) + n_z (ħ/2 [ [1,0], [0,-1] ])

Factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because:

First row: n_z *1 (from P_z) and n_x *1 (from P_x)
Second row: n_x *1 and (-n_z) from P_z.

So P is a 2x2 matrix:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>, and we're looking for λ = +ħ/2. So:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Substituting P:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Hmm, we can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, so:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange both equations.

First equation: n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0.

Second equation: n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0.

So we have two equations:

1) (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

I can write this as a homogeneous system. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero, but let me instead try to find a relationship between a and b.

From equation 1: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Similarly, from equation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.

Wait, so from both equations,

[ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) ) ] = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ]

Multiply both sides by (n_z-1) and n_x:

(-n_x^2) = (n_z +1)(n_z -1)

Wait, because (n_z+1)(n_z-1) is n_z^2 -1.

So: -n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1 → n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

But that's true because n is a unit vector (since it's in the x-z plane), so n_x² + n_z² =1.

Thus, the two equations are consistent but not giving new information. So I can express a in terms of b.

Let me pick one ratio. Let's take from equation 1:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Wait, but n_z is part of the direction vector, which can vary. Hmm, maybe it's better to parameterize n in terms of an angle θ.

Since n is in the x-z plane, I can represent it as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but wait, actually, in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z would have θ (polar angle from z-axis) and φ=0 (since in x-z plane, so no y-component). But wait, perhaps the angle is measured differently here. Let me think: if it's in the x-z plane, then n can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

Wait, that makes sense because when θ=0, n is along z, and when θ=90 degrees, it's along x.

So substituting n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

Then, let's plug this into the equation for a in terms of b.

From equation 1:

a = [ -n_x / (n_z - 1) ] b → a = [ -cosθ / (sinθ -1) ] b.

Hmm, let's simplify the denominator:

sinθ -1 = -(1 - sinθ) → denominator is negative (1 - sinθ).

Wait, so:

a = [ -cosθ / ( - (1 - sinθ) ) ] b → a = [ cosθ / (1 - sinθ) ] b.

Alternatively, maybe we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ):

cosθ*(1 + sinθ) / [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ) ] → denominator is 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So,

a = [ cosθ (1 + sinθ) ] / cos²θ * b → simplifies to [ (1 + sinθ) / cosθ ] b.

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a in terms of b using another approach.

Alternatively, since the eigenvector is up to a scalar multiple, perhaps I can set b =1 and find a. But let's think in terms of possible eigenvectors.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvalue equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

So the matrix is (P - (ħ/2) I) which is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ].

Wait, so the matrix becomes:

[ (n_z -1), n_x ],
[ n_x, (-n_z -1) ]

Multiply by the vector (a, b) gives zero.

So the equations:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → equation (1)

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 → equation (2)

Wait, earlier I thought equation 2 was n_x a - (n_z +1) b=0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's recheck.

Wait, the second row of the matrix is [n_x, -n_z -1]. So equation (2) is:

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.

Hmm, okay, so from equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b.

But from equation (2), a = (n_z +1) b / n_x.

Substituting a into equation (1):

(n_z -1) * [ (n_z +1) b /n_x ] + n_x b = 0.

Multiply both sides by n_x to eliminate denominator:

(n_z -1)(n_z +1) b + n_x^2 b =0.

Which is (n_z² -1) b + n_x^2 b = 0.

But since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, n_z^2 =1 -n_x^2. So substitute:

( (1 -n_x^2) -1 ) b + n_x^2 b = 0 → (-n_x^2) b + n_x^2 b = 0 → 0=0.

So again, no new information. So the equations are consistent and we can proceed.

Thus, from equation (2), a = (n_z +1) b / n_x.

But n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ.

So a = (sinθ +1)/cosθ * b.

Hmm, let's see. So the ratio a/b is (sinθ +1)/cosθ.

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( (sinθ +1)/cosθ , 1 ).

But perhaps it's better to write it in terms of θ/2 or something, but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find the eigenvector for the spin-1/2 system along an arbitrary direction.

Wait, I recall that for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of S·n (where n is the direction) are given by spin-up and spin-down states. The spin-up state along n is given by:

|+n> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]

Since in this problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so the state becomes [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but in our case, the
