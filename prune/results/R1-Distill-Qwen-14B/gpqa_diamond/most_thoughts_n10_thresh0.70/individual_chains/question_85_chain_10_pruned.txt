Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down. So, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star, and they've been detected using both transit and radial velocity methods. The star has certain properties: mass is 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are given, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, and since both planets have the same albedo, that factor will cancel out in the ratio. 

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). But since albedo is same for both, I can ignore that part. So the ratio will depend on the square root of (R_star/(2a)) for each planet. 

But wait, can I get the distance 'a' from the RV method data? Because the Doppler shift gives us the mass function and the velocity amplitude, which relates to the planet's mass and the distance. 

Looking at the data: the RV shifts are given in terms of Ångströms for the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, and Planet2 0.04 Å. But wait
