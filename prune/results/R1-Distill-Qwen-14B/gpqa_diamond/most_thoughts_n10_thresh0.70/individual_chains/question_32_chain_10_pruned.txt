Okay, I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll give it a shot. Let's read the question again.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that must be Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the mass I'll need is for a Li-6 nucleus.

First, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a moving particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula for gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So, gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute v². 0.96c squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1 (because 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1). Hmm, yes, so gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, let me compute it more precisely. Let's see, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857 (approximately 3.5714).

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, and a neutron is about 939 MeV. Wait, wait, I think the neutron is slightly heavier than the proton. Let me double-check the exact masses. Oh, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. So the atomic mass of Li-6 is about... I think the mass is approximately 6 atomic mass units. Wait, but the exact value might be a bit different. Let me think. One atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So, the mass of a proton is about 1.0
