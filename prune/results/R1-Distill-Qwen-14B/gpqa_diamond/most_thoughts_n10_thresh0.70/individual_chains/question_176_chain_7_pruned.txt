Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes.

First, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a second. I remember that quantum states are usually represented as vectors in a complex Hilbert space, but here the elements are real numbers. Oh well, maybe it's a real vector space. So the state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let me note that down.

Next, the operators for observables P and Q are given as matrices. Let's look at matrix P first. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, okay. So P is a 3x3 matrix.

Then, matrix Q has a diagonal structure. The first row is [1, 0, 0], the second [0,0,0], and the third [0,0,-1]. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, it says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." Oh, right, the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. But wait, the probabilities are for getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the question states: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So first measuring P and getting 0, then measuring Q and getting -1.

Wait, but I think when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that operator. So the state after measuring P will be an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, when measuring Q, it's done on this new state.

So the overall approach is: 

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. We're interested in the eigenvalue 0 because we want the system to be in that state after measuring P.

2. Check if the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is an eigenstate of Q. If so, then measuring Q would give the corresponding eigenvalue with probability 1. If not, we need to calculate the overlap.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the state after measuring P (when the outcome is 0) is the projection of the original state onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0. Then, from that projected state, we calculate the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, we can set up the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or symmetry here. Let's see.

Let me write P in terms of matrices. Each entry is:

P = [ [0, a, 0],
       [a, 0, a],
       [0, a, 0] ]

where a = 1/sqrt(2).

Hmm, perhaps it's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. Let me try to find the eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation is |P - λ I| = 0.

So the determinant of:

[ -λ, a, 0 ]

[ a, -λ, a ]

[ 0, a, -λ ]

Expanding this determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] - a * [ a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0 * (...) 

Wait, let's compute the determinant properly. The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a^2 ]  - a * [ (a)(-λ) - a * 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant by expanding along the first row.

So, element (1,1) is -λ; the minor is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix:

[ -λ, a ]

[ a, -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - a*a = λ² - a².

Then, the element (1,2) is a, and the minor is the determinant of:

[ a, a ]

[ 0, -λ ]

Which is (a*(-λ) - a * 0) = -a λ.

But since we're expanding the first row, the sign for (1,2) is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the term is a * (-1) * (-a λ) ?

Wait, let me be precise. The determinant expansion is sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^(i+j) * M_ij * det(minor). Here, i=1 for the first row.

So for element (1,1): j=1, so (-1)^(1+1) = 1. The minor is the determinant of the submatrix when row 1 and column 1 are removed. Which is:

Row 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3.

So the submatrix is:

[ 0, a ]

[ a, 0 ]

Wait no, wait. No, when you remove row 1 and column 1, the submatrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3:

Row 2, columns 2,3: [0, a]

Row 3, columns 2,3: [a, 0]

So the minor determinant is (0)(0) - (a)(a) = -a².

So the term for (1,1) is (-λ) * (-a²) = λ a².

Wait wait, no. Because the minor is the determinant of this 2x2 matrix, which is (0)(-λ) - (a)(a) = -a². So the term from (1,1) is (-λ) * (-a²) = λ a².

Then, element (1,2): j=2, so (-1)^(1+2) = -1. The minor is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.

That submatrix is rows 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3. So:

Row 2: [a, a]

Row 3: [0, -λ]

The determinant is (a)(-λ) - (a)(0) = -a λ.

So the term from (1,2) is a * (-1) * (-a λ) = a * (a λ) = a² λ.

Element (1,3) is 0, so no contribution.

So the determinant is λ a² + a² λ = 2 λ a².

Wait, 2 λ a² = 0 → λ (2 a²) = 0 → λ = 0, since a is non-zero.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the determinant is 2 λ a², setting to zero gives λ = 0. But a 3x3 matrix can't have only one eigenvalue. That suggests I made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the determinant calculation.

Wait, perhaps I
