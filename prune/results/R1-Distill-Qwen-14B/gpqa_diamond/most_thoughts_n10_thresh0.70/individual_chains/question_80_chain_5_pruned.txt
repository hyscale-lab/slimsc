Okay, so I've got this question here about an algorithm that converts some strings into numbers. Let me see if I can figure this out.

The question gives two examples: AGG turns into 115, and TGCTGA becomes 176. Then it asks what ACAGTGACC would give. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure how the algorithm works. I need to find a pattern or a rule that connects the input DNA sequences to the output numbers.

Let me look at the first example: AGG is 115. Let's break down AGG. Each letter could represent a number. Wait, in DNA, A is Adenine, T is Thymine, C is Cytosine, G is Guanine. But how does that translate to numbers?

Another thought: Maybe each nucleotide is assigned a specific value. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Let me test this with the first example.

AGG would be A (1) + G (4) + G (4) = 1+4+4 = 9. But the output is 115, which is way higher. So maybe it's not a simple sum.

Wait, maybe each base is converted to a number, and then the whole string is treated as a base-4 number. Let me think. AGG in base 4 would be 1*(4^2) + 4*(4^1) +4*(4^0) = 1*16 +4*4 +4*1 = 16 +16 +4 =36. But 36 is not 115. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a base system but each base is mapped differently. Let's make a table:

A, T, C, G â†’ numbers. Let me try other mappings. Sometimes in coding problems, A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Let's try that.

AGG would be A=0, G=3, G=3. So 0 3 3. If we treat this as a base-4 number: 0*4^2 +3*4 +3 = 0 +12 +3=15. But the output is 115, so that's not matching.

Wait another idea: Maybe each nucleotide is converted into two digits. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Then each letter is two digits, but that doesn't make sense because A is 1, which is one digit. Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is represented by its position in the alphabet. A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Let me try that.

AGG would be A=1, G=7, G=7. Then sum is 1+7+7=15. Doesn't match 115. Hmm.

Another angle: perhaps the output is the sum of each base's value multiplied by a position factor. Like the first position is 1, second 2, etc. For AGG, A is
