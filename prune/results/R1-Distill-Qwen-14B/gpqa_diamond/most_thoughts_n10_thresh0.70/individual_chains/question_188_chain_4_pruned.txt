Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the interplanar distance, d, in a crystal lattice is given by the formula derived from the diffraction condition. Oh right, the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt((h² + k² + l²) + (something with the angles)). Wait, wait. For a cubic crystal, the formula is simpler, but this is rhombohedral, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system where the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral crystal, all edges are equal (a = b = c), but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal and not 90 degrees.

So for a cubic system, the interplanar distance formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But when the angles aren't 90 degrees, like in rhombohedral, the formula changes. I think it involves the angles.

I recall that the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

1/d² = (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2hk cos(beta - alpha)/(a b) ) - 2hl cos(gamma - alpha)/(a c) - 2kl cos(alpha - beta)/(b c)

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c. So that should simplify the formula.

So substituting a = b = c, let's see. The formula becomes:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² - 2(hk cos(theta1) + hl cos(theta2) + kl cos(theta3)) / a² )

Wait, what are the angles between? Oh, right, the angles in the formula are the angles between the unit vectors. So in a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is alpha, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is gamma. Wait, but in this problem, all three angles are 30 degrees. So alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

Wait, so theta1 is the angle between b and a, which is alpha. Theta2 is between a and c, which is beta. Theta3 is between b and c, which is gamma. So in our case, all are 30 degrees.

So 1/d² = [h² + k² + l² + (-2hk cos(alpha) - 2hl cos(beta) - 2kl cos(gamma))]/a².

But since alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees, the expression becomes:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos(30) - 2hl cos(30) - 2kl cos(30)] / a².

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor any terms. Since all the cos terms are the same, maybe I can factor that out.

Wait, the numerator becomes: h² + k² +
