Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says X is a meson resonance, and we're supposed to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So, very tiny distances, which makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distance they travel before decaying should be minuscule.

I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but wait—Γ here is the total decay width, right? So the lifetime depends inversely on the width. But wait, I think that's for the lifetime. Then, once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. Oh right, because distance is velocity multiplied by time.

So, the steps I need to take are: 1) Find the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ. 2) Find the particle's velocity, probably using relativistic equations since the energies are high. 3) Multiply velocity by τ to get the mean decay distance, which is often denoted as cτ or βγcτ, depending on whether it's for a relativistic particle.

Wait, wait. Let me get the formulas right. The total decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm / c, but maybe better to use the GeV version.

Wait, let me get my units straight. The width Γ is given in MeV, so 320 MeV. But the other energies are in GeV. So I should convert all to the same unit, probably GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

So calculating τ: τ = ħ / Γ. Let's plug in the numbers.
