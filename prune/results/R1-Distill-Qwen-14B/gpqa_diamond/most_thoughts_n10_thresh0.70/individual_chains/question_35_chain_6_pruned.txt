Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator called Ay. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the problem states that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator, and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I can write matrix S as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i,  0]]

And then Ay would be c times this matrix. So let me compute that. Since c is h/(4π), then Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

So, Ay would be:

[[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
 [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let me set up the matrix (Ay - a I):

[[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ],
 [ (i h)/(4π), -a ]]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Calculating the determinant:

a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i) * i = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - [ (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

So determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

So, a² = (h^2)/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, wait a second. Because sqrt( (h^2)/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake there. Because when we compute the determinant, it's (a)(a) - [ (elements off-diagonal multiplied) ]. Wait, no— the determinant for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]] is ad - bc. So I think I did it right. Because the top-left is -a, top-right is (-i h)/(4π), bottom-left is (i h)/(4π), and bottom-right is -a.

So det = (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))* (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

(-i)(i) = (-i * i) = -i² = -( -1 ) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (h^2)/(16 π²) = 0. So a = ± h/(4 π). 

Wait, but that's the same as the c value. Because c is (h)/(4π
