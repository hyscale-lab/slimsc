Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE) for each state.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum of exp(-βE) for each possible state. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. That's manageable.

But wait, what's the energy of each state? The energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Let me think: each product S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. So when S_i = S_j, the product is +1; when opposite, it's -1.

So the energy E is -J multiplied by the sum of these three terms. Let me write that as E = -J*(A + B + C), where A, B, C are each either +1 or -1.

Each term in the exponent in the partition function would be exp(βJ (A + B + C)), because E is negative. Because β is 1/(kT), and E is negative, so -βE is positive.

Wait, let me check: Z is sum_{states} exp(-βE). So E is -J(...), so -
