Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, lithium has 3 protons normally, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's Li-6? Because Li has atomic number 3, so mass number 3+3=6.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium has Z=3, so number of protons is 3. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. So I need to find the energy of the collider such that the speed is 0.96c.

The options are in GeV, so I know this is about relativistic energies. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma. Let me calculate that first.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/(0.28) ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me do that more accurately. 0.96^2 is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784... Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, I think I should calculate it more precisely. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So yeah, that's gamma.

Now, the energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². Same for neutrons, approximately 939.565 MeV/c². So to get the total mass of the nucleus, I should sum the masses of the protons and neutrons.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the mass of a nucleus isn't exactly the sum of the individual nucleons because of binding energy and mass defect. Oh, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we're supposed to approximate it as the sum of individual masses. Or maybe we need to use the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number A for
