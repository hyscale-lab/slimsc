Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface area. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere has spots, as it rotates, the brightness observed from Earth will change periodically. The question is saying that this situation can mimic an exoplanet causing brightness variations. We need to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve if the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So, the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the star spots with that caused by an exoplanet. Both cause dips in brightness when they pass in front of the star (for the planet) or when the spots rotate into and out of view (for the star spots).

Wait, but the star's spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness because the spots are darker than the rest of the star. The same effect as a planet transiting the star, which blocks some light.

So, the amplitude of the brightness variation depends on the area of the spot and the planet relative to the star.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about both cases.

In the case of the spots:

The star is emitting light with some brightness. The spots are cooler, so they emit less. The total brightness variation is due to the spots moving into and out of view as the star rotates.

The change in brightness would be the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is lower because the spots are dark. As the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing a dip and a rise in brightness.

Similarly, when a planet transits the star, the planet blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of the dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the area of the star.

So to find the radius of the planet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots, we need to calculate the fractional area of the spots and set that equal to the fractional area of the planet.

But wait, the spots are on only one
