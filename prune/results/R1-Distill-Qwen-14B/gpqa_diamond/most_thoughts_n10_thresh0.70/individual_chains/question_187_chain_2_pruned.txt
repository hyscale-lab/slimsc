Okay, I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is that the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) should be at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. 

Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, so it's designed for precise measurements. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me think about the factors involved here.

First, I should probably consider the brightness of each star as seen from Earth because a higher brightness (lower magnitude) would make it easier to achieve a good S/N. The formula for calculating the S/N depends on the flux from the star, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. 

Wait, the stars are given with absolute magnitudes. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs. To find their apparent magnitudes, I can use the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs. 

Let me list out each star and compute their apparent (m) magnitudes:

a) Canopus: I remember Canopus is a very bright star. Its absolute magnitude is around -5.7, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should look up its apparent magnitude. Wait, Canopus is about magnitude -0.7, but that's apparent. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7. So M would be the absolute magnitude, which for Canopus is about -5.7. So its distance is, I think, around 300 light-years or about 90 pc. Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think, Canopus is in the constellation Carina. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7, and absolute magnitude is around -5.7. So yes, that's correct. So if it's at around 90 pc, but the question says it's one of the options. Wait, but the options for a) to f) include specific distances except a) and b). Oh wait, a) Canopus's distance isn't given; it's just the name. Hmm. So I need to know Canopus's distance to compute m.

But wait, alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is considering that all stars except a, b will have their distances given. So let me proceed.

Wait, for options a) Canopus and b) Polaris, I need to know their distances. Alternatively, perhaps I can instead think about the V magnitudes and the relation to S/N.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to calculate the S/N for each star based on their flux. The S/N ratio is proportional to the square root of the exposure time and the flux from the star. The flux depends on the star's apparent magnitude.

Wait, but the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity is such that it can detect a certain S/N for a given magnitude. To find out if each star's magnitude is bright enough to reach S/N >=10 in 1 hour.

I'm trying to remember how to calculate this. I think the formula for S/N is S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / noise. But perhaps in terms of magnitudes, there's a way to compare using the instrument's capabilities.

Wait, I found a resource before that says the ESPRESSO spectrograph can reach a certain S/N ratio per pixel for stars of a given V magnitude in a certain exposure time. I'm not exactly sure of the exact numbers, but perhaps the key is to determine for each star whether
