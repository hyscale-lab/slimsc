Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says: We have a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, I remember that in a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so things are a bit different.

In the classical, non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)m v_max². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is that. But wait, the problem says it's relativistic, so option C might not be the right answer. Hmm.

Relativistically, the energy considerations are different. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies oscillate. But since it's relativistic, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, or is it that the oscillator
