Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't just use classical mechanics equations. I need to think about how relativity affects the motion.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass. Oh right, in the classical case, maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But relativistically, things are different because of the energy-momentum relation and the speed approaching the speed of light.

Wait, so the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. But in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic (like (1/2)mv²) anymore. Instead, the energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Oh, right, total energy E is gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So maybe I need to equate the total energy at maximum displacement (A) to the total energy when the mass is moving the fastest, which is when it's at x=0. But wait, no, actually, the maximum speed occurs when the entire potential energy has been converted
