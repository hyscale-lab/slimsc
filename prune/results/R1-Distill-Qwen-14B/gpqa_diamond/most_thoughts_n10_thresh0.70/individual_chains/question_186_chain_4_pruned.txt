Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement, and I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but let's see if I can work this out. The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, I need to find out what product forms when it undergoes a Cope rearrangement.

First, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, where a six-membered cyclic transition state forms, leading to the rearrangement of substituents. So, the starting material should have a diene structure that can engage in this kind of rearrangement.

Looking at the structure of the given compound, it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system. The substituents are a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the 2-azabicyclo structure. Wait, the 2-azabicyclo part means there's a nitrogen at position 2. So, the structure is a bicyclic system with a bridge, and a vinyl group attached to carbon 2.

Let me try to visualize this. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have two rings. The numbering goes such that the bridgehead is between positions 1 and 4. So, position 2 is adjacent to the bridge. The vinyl group is attached to position 2, so it's like a substituent there.

Now, for the Cope rearrangement, I think the molecule must have two conjugated double bonds forming a diene. Wait, the structure has a double bond in the bicyclo part (the hept-5-ene) and another double bond from the vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So the molecule is 2-vinyl, which means the vinyl is attached to position 2, and the existing double bond is at position 5.

So, the diene is formed between the vinyl group and the bridgehead double bond? Wait, no, the vinyl is CH2-CH2 or CH2-CH-? Wait, wait, 2-vinyl would be
