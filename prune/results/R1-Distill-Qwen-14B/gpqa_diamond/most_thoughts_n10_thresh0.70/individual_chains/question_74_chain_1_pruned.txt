Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, they're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, no, wait a second. Let me read that again. Oh, no, no, wait. The question says, the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but the initial statement was that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. So from now, we're looking at the next 150 minutes? Or is it the next time period? Wait, I might be misunderstanding the question.

Wait, no. Let me parse this again. So the atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes. That's the initial probability. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed. So now, the remaining time is 150 minutes (since 50 +150=200, but the initial 100 was probably the half-life or something else? Wait no, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the decay follows an exponential law. So the decay probability is based on the time. The key thing is that in radioactive decay, the probability of decay is independent of time, so the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the future probability. So the 32% is the probability over 100 minutes. Now, when we're 50 minutes in, and we're looking at the next 150 minutes, what's the chance?

Wait, no. Because the way the question is phrased, the decay is a 32% chance within 100 minutes. So perhaps that's the half-life? Wait, 32% is about a third, which is roughly a half-life of
