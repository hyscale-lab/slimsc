Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm, it says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, so the setup is that the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the beam is going through the glass which itself is moving. I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, but what about when the medium is moving relative to the observer?

I think about the speed of light in different frames of reference. Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is a classical optics problem, maybe? Because the options don't involve c as a variable but n and v. Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming Galilean addition, which is okay for non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Because in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Let me think. Suppose the medium (glass) is moving with velocity v relative to the lab frame. The light is moving at speed v_light = c/n relative to the glass. So from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how do I add these velocities?

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so relative to the glass, the light's speed is c/n. So from the lab frame, the light's speed would be v_light_lab = (v + c/n) ?

Wait no, that's Galilean addition, which is only good at non-relativistic speeds. But the problem states to take c=1, so maybe they are using Galilean velocity addition here.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going through the moving glass. So the glass's frame is moving relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n (assuming c is 1, so 1/n). But when the glass itself is moving at velocity v, in the lab frame, what's the
