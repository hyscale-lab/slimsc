Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, it affects how we perceive light and other phenomena, so this must involve some relativity concepts.

The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, the options are given, so maybe I can think about it in terms of classical or relativistic mechanics. Let's see. In the glass, the speed of light is normally c/n, right? Because the index of refraction slows down the light. But wait, wait, in the problem statement, c is given as 1. So the speed in the glass is 1/n.

But the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed? Hmm, I think this isn't just a simple addition of velocities because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly when you're dealing with speeds close to the speed of light. But wait, the options don't look like they involve relativistic formulas like Lorentz transformations. They look more like they're combining n and v in a fraction.

Wait, maybe I should consider the frame of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. From the lab's frame, what's the speed of light in the glass? Let me think: in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n. But the glass is moving, so we have to find the transformed velocity of the light in the lab frame.

Oh, so I probably need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u * v)/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, u would be the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. And c is 1 here.

Wait, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So, in the glass's frame, the light has velocity u = 1/n (since in the glass, it's moving at c/n, which is 1/n). So the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame in the same direction as the
