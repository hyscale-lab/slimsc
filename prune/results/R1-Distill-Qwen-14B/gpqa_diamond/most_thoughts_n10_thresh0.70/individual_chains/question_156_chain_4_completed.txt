Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine what the chromatograms will show.

First, I should think about what mCPBA does. I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. That's probably what's happening here.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, so each should form an epoxide.

Wait, but what happens when you form an epoxide from a diene? Oh, right, the stereochemistry of the double bond will influence the structure of the epoxide. Let me think about how the geometry affects the epoxide.

Epoxidation with mCPBA is a peracid reaction, which is an electrocyclic opening. The peracid adds across the double bond, leading to the formation of an epoxide. The process is stereospecific. So the configuration of the starting alkene will determine the configuration of the epoxide.

(E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on opposite sides. When mCPBA reacts, the epoxide will form with a certain stereochemistry. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene has substituents on the same side, so the epoxide formed will have a different configuration.

Wait, but let me get this right. When mCPBA adds to the double bond, the peracid adds in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face. Or is it the opposite? I think the peracid approaches from the same face, leading to a cis addition. No, wait, that's for epoxidation. Because when the peracid attacks, it adds across the double bond with the oxygen adding from the same face, leading to the formation of an epoxide. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction proceeds through a cyclic transition state, so the stereochemistry is retained. Let me think: mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry of the double bond becomes the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on opposite sides. After epoxidation, the two oxygen atoms (from the epoxide) will be on opposite sides as well. Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on the same side, so the epoxide will have both oxygen atoms on the same side.

Wait, no. Wait, the epoxide is a three-membered ring with two adjacent oxygen atoms. In the epoxide, the two new oxygen atoms are added across the former double bond, so the geometry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

So for E double bonds, the resulting epoxide will have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides (trans configuration), and for Z double bonds, the oxygen atoms will be on the same side (cis configuration). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it. Let's imagine oct-4-ene. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents (like CH2CH3 groups) on C4 and C5 are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across, the peracid would add an O to each carbon. Since the starting double bond is trans (E), the approach is such that the resulting epoxide will have the two O's on opposite faces, making the epoxide itself also trans.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because in epoxidation, the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are on the same face. So for a trans (E) double bond, the substituents are on opposite sides. Adding two oxygen atoms from the same face would cause the epoxide to have adjacent substituents on the same face, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the endo transition state. The peracid adds the epoxide oxygen across the double bond with a certain stereochemistry. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, this leads to different epoxide structures.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that when a peracid reacts with a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide formed is a cis epoxide, and when it reacts with a cis (Z) alkene, the epoxide is trans. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. Let me think of it this way: the peracid adds an oxygen from the same face of the double bond. So for an E double bond, the substituents are opposite. If the peracid adds the two oxygens from the same face, then the substituents on each carbon (like R groups) would end up on the same side, making the epoxide a cis structure.

Wait, maybe that's it. So for E-alkene, the addition of two oxygens from the same face would result in the substituents (like the two CH2CH3 groups) being on the same side in the epoxide, making it a cis (or Z) epoxide. Conversely, for a Z-alkene, the substituents are on the same side, and adding oxygens from the same face would lead to substituents being on opposite sides in the epoxide, making it a trans (E) epoxide.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try with an example. Suppose I have (E)-2-pentene. When mCPBA adds, it adds two oxygen atoms from the same face. So the two CH2CH3 groups (if that's the substituents) would be on opposite sides in the starting alkene. After epoxidation, in the epoxide, the substituents (like CH2CH2 groups) would be on the same side because the oxygen atoms are added from the same face, which brings them together.

Wait, maybe I should think of the double bond as C=C. For (E), the two substituents are opposite. When the peracid adds, the O from the peracid adds to each carbon from the same face. So, for (E), substituent R groups are on opposite sides. Adding O from same face would put the two O's on the same face, but the R groups would still be opposite, leading into a trans arrangement in the epoxide? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E) and (Z) alkenes will form different diastereomers when epoxidized. Wait, but wait, epoxidation of an E and Z alkene would yield two different epoxides, each with a different configuration. So, (E)-oct-4-ene would form a trans epoxide, and (Z) would form a cis epoxide.

But wait, wait. Let's think about the product.

For (E)-oct-4-ene: the substituents (like CH2CH3 groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond. When mCPBA adds, the peracid adds an oxygen to each carbon from the same face. So, if the double bond is E, the substituents are opposite. Adding the O atoms from the same face would cause the substituents to be on the same side in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe that's correct. So, for E-alkene, the substituents are opposite. Adding O atoms from same face would cause substituents to end up on same side, making a cis epoxide. Similarly, for Z-alkene, substituents are same side, adding O's from same face would lead substituents to be on opposite sides, making a trans epoxide.

Wait, no, that might be the opposite. Maybe the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the reaction. The epoxidation using mCPBA leads to the formation of an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. For (E)-double bonds, the epoxide is a cis diastereomer, and for (Z)-double bonds, it's a trans epoxide. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps both (E) and (Z) alkenes would form the same epoxide. Wait, no, that's not possible because the starting material is different.

Wait, maybe the key here is that the initial epoxide formed from (E) and (Z) alkenes are different. So after each reaction, you have two different epoxides.

Wait, but then each reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh, right, the acid work-up. So epoxides, when treated with acid, undergo ring-opening. What happens in acid?

Epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions typically involves the addition of a proton to the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. In aqueous acid, the nucleophile is water.

The mechanism for epoxide ring-opening in acid: the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Then, water (or another nucleophile) attacks the less substituted carbon (if possible) in a SN2-like mechanism, leading to ring opening.

Wait, but in some cases, like with symmetric epoxides, the ring-opening might be more about the structure of the epoxide. Let me think: when (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, what's the structure of the epoxide?

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Wait no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: the double bond is between C4 and C5. So:

The structure of (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So it's CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with double bond.

So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, no, octene has eight carbons. So, for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no, I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Actually, for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 becomes CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's not correct. Let me just think of it as having four carbons on each side of the double bond.

So, (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5, and the substituents on opposite sides. So when epoxidized, the epoxide will have the two oxygens added across the double bond.

But the key point is that the (E) and (Z) alkenes form different epoxides. So reaction 1 gives one epoxide, reaction 2 gives another.

Then, each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid. So each epoxide will undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening.

What's the product of epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions?

Typically, the ring opens to form a diol. The mechanism leads to the formation of a trans-diol because the nucleophilic attack occurs from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen, leading to anti addition.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the stereochemistry of the diol. Let me think: when an epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens with nucleophilic attack. The protonation makes one oxygen leave, and the nucleophile (like water) attacks the adjacent carbon. Since the epoxide is a three-membered ring, the attack occurs with inversion of configuration.

Wait, but for a simple epoxide like ethylene oxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would lead to a trans diol because the nucleophile comes from the opposite side.

Wait, but for more substituted epoxides, the ring-opening can be more complex. In octene epoxide, each carbon of the epoxide is attached to two CH2 groups.

So, after ring-opening with acid, each epoxide would form a diol. But the stereochemistry of the diol depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Let me think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A. Epoxide A is a trans epoxide (because the starting alkene was E, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide? Or is it cis? Hmm, this is the crux.)

Wait, another approach: the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond, and the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For (E) alkenes, the epoxide is a cis diastereomer, and for (Z) alkenes, it's a trans diastereomer. Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomeric epoxides, when opened under acidic conditions, form different diols.

Wait, when mCPBA reacts with (E) and (Z) alkenes, it forms two different epoxides. Then, each epoxide, upon acid treatment, forms a diol. The question is whether the diol from each epoxide is the same or different.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide ring-opening leads to a different diol. Because if the epoxide's stereochemistry is different, the diol's configuration would be different.

Wait, but maybe not. Because when the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each epoxide leads to the same diol. No, that can't be right. Because the epoxide's configuration would influence the diol's stereochemistry.

Hmm. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose the epoxide is cis or trans. When you protonate the oxygen, the ring opens, and the nucleophile attacks from the opposite side. So the diol's configuration would reflect the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, let's imagine a simple epoxide like trans-epoxide. Upon ring-opening, the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on opposite sides. Or same sides?

Wait, no. Let's take a simple epoxide, say, cyclohexene oxide (cis). When treated with acid, the ring opens with water attacking the less hindered carbon (assuming the same on both sides). The attack would be from the opposite side of the protonated oxygen, leading to the hydroxyl groups being on opposite sides of the ring, making a trans-diol.

Wait, but for a trans-epoxide, would the diol be cis or trans?

Wait, perhaps the diol's stereochemistry is opposite to the epoxide's. Because the attack occurs from the opposite side.

Alternatively, maybe the diol's configuration is the same as the epoxide's.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming that each reaction produces a different epoxide, which upon acid treatment gives a different diol.

Wait, but what's the outcome for each reaction?

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide A → Diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide B → Diol B.

If the diols are different, then combining them would give a mixture of Diol A and Diol B.

Now, when these diols are run on HPLC, what happens?

The standard (achiral) HPLC column doesn't distinguish between enantiomers or diastereomers. So if Diol A and Diol B are diastereomers, the standard HPLC would show two peaks.

But wait, are Diol A and Diol B enantiomers? Or are they diastereomers?

Alternatively, if the diols are enantiomers, then on a standard HPLC, they would co-elute, but on a chiral column, they would show as two separate peaks.

But wait, I think that each epoxide's diol is a diastereomer of the other.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomeric epoxide, which upon ring-opening gives a different diastereomeric diol. So, combining them would yield two diastereomers.

But wait, what's the actual product of the epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, another angle: when each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the diol formed from each will have a specific stereochemistry. If the starting epoxides are different, the diols must be different.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide A → Diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → Epoxide B → Diol B.

Diols A and B are different diastereomers.

So, when you combine the products, you have Diol A and Diol B.

Now, when you run these on a standard HPLC, which is achiral, Diols A and B are diastereomers. Diastereomers will have different physical properties, so they'll elute as separate peaks. So, two peaks on standard HPLC.

On a chiral HPLC, if the diols are enantiomers, they would each elute as a single peak. But if they're diastereomers, they would still show as separate peaks. Wait, no. Chiral columns separate enantiomers, but if the molecules are diastereomers, they may not be separated by a chiral column.

Wait, no. Chiral columns are designed to resolve enantiomers, but diastereomers would have different physical interactions and would elute at different times. So, in that case, if the diols are diastereomers, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the diols are not chiral. Wait, if the diol is a meso compound, it wouldn't be chiral.

Wait, let's think about the diol structure. Oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule. So, when the epoxide is formed, the diol after ring-opening would have two adjacent hydroxyl groups. But the molecule may have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, for example, after the ring-opening, if the diol has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the starting epoxide from (E) and (Z) alkenes leads to diols that are meso compounds, then they would be achiral. But if the diols are different, perhaps they are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the exact structure.

Assuming the starting alkene is symmetric, the epoxide would be symmetric as well. Then, upon ring-opening, the diol would also be symmetric.

Wait, no. The starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), which are not symmetric. For oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same. So, the molecule is symmetric. So, for both (E) and (Z), the epoxide would have a certain symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans epoxide, and the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis epoxide. Then, upon ring-opening, each would form a diol with a certain configuration.

But wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric. So (E) and (Z) would have different configurations but would each have a plane of symmetry. So, their epoxides would have a plane of symmetry as well.

Then, when the epoxides are treated with acid, the ring opens to form diols. If the epoxides are symmetric, would the diols be meso compounds?

For instance, let’s say the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, leading to a diol that's a meso compound. Similarly, the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene is cis, and upon ring-opening, also forms a meso diol.

Wait, but then both diols would be the same meso compound. That can’t be right because the starting materials are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide from (E) and (Z) alkenes are different, leading to different diols.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

In the first reaction, (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, forming an epoxide. Then, acid work-up gives a diol. Similarly, in the second reaction, (Z)-oct-4-ene gives another diol.

Assuming that the diols are different, then when combined, you have two diastereomers.

Wait, but if each diol is a meso compound, then they would be the same compound, not different.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but since the reaction goes to 100% completion, each diol would be a single enantiomer.

Wait, that's not possible because the diol from each reaction would be a racemic mixture if the epoxide is symmetric. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe each diol is a single enantiomer. For example, the (E)-epoxide would form a diol with a certain configuration, and the (Z)-epoxide would form the opposite configuration.

Wait, but the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Let me think again: mCPBA adds an oxygen to each carbon of the double bond. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are opposite. So, the epoxide formed would have substituents on the same side because the oxygens are added from the same face.

Wait, perhaps the (E) epoxide is a cis epoxide, and the (Z) epoxide is a trans epoxide.

But when the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's.

So, for a cis epoxide (from Z-alkene?), the diol formed would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis), but wait, under acidic conditions, the attack is from the opposite side, leading to a trans diol. Or is it?

No. The ring-opening under acidic conditions usually leads to the formation of a trans diol because the nucleophile attacks the opposite side. So, if the epoxide is cis, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans). Similarly, if the epoxide is trans, the diol would also have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, but perhaps in a different configuration.

Wait, but this is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach.

The products after both reactions are run on HPLC.

Each reaction produces a diol. If the diols are different, then in the standard HPLC, which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, you'll see two peaks. On the chiral HPLC, if the diols are enantiomers, you'd see two peaks for each enantiomer, but if they are diastereomers, you'd see two peaks again.

Wait, but in the case of diastereomers, the chiral HPLC would separate them, but if the molecules are not chiral themselves, the chiral column wouldn't separate them either.

Wait, no. Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers would still be separated on a regular (achiral) column.

Wait, but if the diol is a meso compound, it's achiral, so it would show as a single peak on both columns.

Wait, let's think: if each diol is a meso compound, then each would be a single peak on the standard HPLC. But since both reactions produce the same meso diol, combining them would give just one product, leading to a single peak on both columns.

But that's not matching any of the options. The options don't have a single peak.

Wait, but earlier I thought the diols from each reaction might be different. So, perhaps each reaction produces a diastereomer of the other.

So, when you combine the products, you have two diastereomeric diols. Now, when you run them on standard HPLC, you'd see two peaks because diastereomers have different physical properties.

On a chiral HPLC, since they're diastereomers, not enantiomers, the chiral column wouldn't separate them. Wait, no. Chiral columns are designed for enantiomers. Diastereomers would be separated based on their different physical interactions with the column, regardless of whether they're chiral or not.

Wait, but if the diols are diastereomers, then the standard HPLC would show two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks, because diastereomers have different retention times even on a chiral column.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the diol formed from each reaction is the same. That would lead to a single peak on both columns. But I don't think that's the case because the starting materials are different.

Wait, perhaps the diol is a single compound. If the diol is a meso compound, then it would be achiral. So, the standard HPLC would show one peak, and the chiral HPLC would also show one peak (since it's a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers).

But then, the options don't have a single peak in either. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers. If that's the case, then in standard HPLC, each pair would co-elute, showing as two peaks if the diols are different. Wait, no. If each diol is a racemic mixture, they'd show as a single peak on standard HPLC. But if the diols are different, perhaps each is a different pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but I'm getting myself more confused. Let's try to think of what the products would look like.

After reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → diol A.

After reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B → diol B.

Now, if diol A and diol B are enantiomers, then on standard HPLC, each would be a single peak, but if they're each a pair of enantiomers, the combined mixture would have two enantiomeric pairs, but on standard HPLC, each would co-elute, giving two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each enantiomeric pair would split into two peaks, giving a total of four. But the options don't have four, except option A and D.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Each reaction produces an epoxide, which upon acid work-up gives a diol. The diol's structure depends on the starting epoxide.

If the starting epoxides are different, the diols are different. So, when combined, there are two diastereomeric diols.

In the standard HPLC (achiral), diastereomers would show as two separate peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, if the diols are enantiomers, they would each split into two peaks, giving four peaks. But if they're diastereomers, the chiral column might not separate them, but wait, diastereomers would have different interactions with the column, leading to two peaks on the chiral column as well.

Wait, but if the diols are diastereomers, the chiral column would separate them, same as the standard column. So, standard HPLC: two peaks. Chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But looking at the options, option C is two peaks in both cases.

Wait, but let's think again. Are the diols from reactions 1 and 2 the same or different?

If the starting alkenes are E and Z, and the epoxidation leads to different epoxides (cis and trans), then upon ring-opening, the diols would be different.

So, combining the diols, you have two diastereomers.

On standard HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

So the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

But wait, another possibility: each diol is itself a pair of enantiomers. So, the diol from reaction 1 is a racemic mixture (two enantiomers), and the diol from reaction 2 is another racemic mixture (maybe the same or different enantiomers).

But that's unlikely because each reaction would form a single enantiomer if the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Wait, no. Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are each single enantiomers? No, wait. (E) and (Z) are geometrical isomers, not enantiomers. So, each is a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

So, when each undergoes epoxidation, the resulting epoxide is a single diastereomer, which upon ring-opening gives a single diol.

So, if reaction 1 gives diol A, and reaction 2 gives diol B, and A and B are diastereomers, the combined product has both A and B.

Thus, on standard HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: since A and B are diastereomers, the chiral column would separate them into two peaks.

So, in both cases, two peaks.

Therefore, the correct answer would be C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The goal is to determine the chromatographic behavior of the combined products on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.
   - (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene form different epoxides due to their differing geometries. The (E) isomer forms a trans epoxide, while the (Z) isomer forms a cis epoxide.

2. **Epoxide Ring-Opening**:
   - When treated with aqueous acid, epoxides undergo ring-opening to form diols. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the epoxide.
   - For a trans epoxide (from (E)-oct-4-ene), the diol formed is a trans-diol. For a cis epoxide (from (Z)-oct-4-ene), the diol formed is a cis-diol.

3. **Products**:
   - Reaction 1 produces a trans-diol, and Reaction 2 produces a cis-diol. These diols are diastereomers of each other because they differ in stereochemistry.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers have different physical properties and will elute as separate peaks. Thus, the combined products will show two peaks.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns separate enantiomers but not diastereomers. Since the diols are diastereomers, they will elute as separate peaks. Thus, the combined products will also show two peaks.

### Conclusion:
The combined products of the two reactions yield two diastereomeric diols. On both standard and chiral HPLC columns, these diastereomers will elute as two separate peaks.

**Answer: C**
