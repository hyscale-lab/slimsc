Alright, I'm trying to tackle this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read through it carefully.

So the scenario is that there's a small peptidic compound synthesized, and when they ran the 1H NMR on the crude sample, they saw two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So each peak is about 0.5H? Or maybe each is just splitting into two but the integrals add up to one. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. Hmm, so it's not about coupling with adjacent protons causing splitting, like in an AB system or something. That makes me think it's something else causing the peak to split into two.

Then looking at the LC-MS analysis, the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So each peak is the same mass, same retention time? Wait, the question says same mass spectrum, but the peaks are at different retention times because they're two separate peaks. Oh wait, no. LC-MS separations can separate based on retention time, but if both have the same mass, they might be isomers.

So what could cause the same molecule to have two peaks in LC-MS? Maybe diastereomers or enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same mass but might be separated by the LC column, especially if it's a chiral column. But wait, the question says LC-MS at elevated temperature. Hmm, elevated temperature usually makes the column elute faster, so maybe the column is not chiral since the peaks are clearly defined and same mass.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The two peaks in LC-MS are of equal intensity and same mass. So either enantiomers or diastereomers. But if they were enantiomers, unless the LC column is chiral, they would co-elute. Oh but the problem says it's a crude compound—could it have impurities? No, because the MS is consistent with the expected molecule. So both peaks are the same compound, but perhaps different in their physical state or something else.

Wait, but the two peaks in LC-MS—same mass. So they are the same molecule. Wait, that can't be unless there's a conformational
