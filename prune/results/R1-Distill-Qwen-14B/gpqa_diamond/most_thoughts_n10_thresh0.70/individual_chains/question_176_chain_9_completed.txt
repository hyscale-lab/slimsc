Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, wait—hold on. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, and their elements are complex numbers, right? But here the elements are (-1, 2, 1), which are real. I guess that's acceptable for simplicity.

So, first, I need to understand the setup. The state vector is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The sum of the squares of the elements: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is not 1. That means we need to normalize it before proceeding. So the actual state vector is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

But wait, does the problem mention that the state is normalized? Because the way it's given is (-1, 2, 1), which isn't a unit vector. Oh, I think I should proceed with the assumption that the given state is not normalized, but calculations will require normalization. So I should normalize it before proceeding.

So the first step is to normalize the state vector. Let me compute the normalization factor. The sum is 6, so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(6). So the state vector becomes |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Next, the problem involves measuring P and then Q. So the measurements are sequential: first P, then Q.

I remember that when you measure an observable, you get an eigenvalue of the corresponding operator with a probability given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state. But wait, when you measure P and then Q, the state for the second measurement depends on the outcome of the first measurement. Because the first measurement (of P) collapses the state into an eigenstate of P.

So the steps are:

1. Measure P. The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. Find them.
2. For each eigenvalue of P, compute the probability of getting that value. Then, for each such outcome, compute the probability of getting Q=-1 after the state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector of P.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So we need to find the combined probability of first measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.

So let's break it down.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.

The operator P is given by the matrix:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

But this might get a bit complicated. Let me think if there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for symmetries or patterns in the matrix that would make diagonalization easier.

Looking at P, it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me try to see if it's symmetric. Yes, since P_{i,j} = P_{j,i} for all i,j. So it's Hermitian, which makes sense since it's an observable's operator. So the eigenvalues will be real.

Another approach: Maybe P can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices or some other basis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the eigenvectors have certain symmetries.

Let me consider the structure of P. The diagonal elements are zero. The off-diagonal elements are non-zero only for certain positions.

Wait, looking at the matrix, the first row is [0, a, 0], second is [a, 0, a], third is [0, a, 0], where a = 1/sqrt(2).

Hmm, this looks like a symmetric matrix with a specific pattern. Maybe it's a permutation matrix scaled by a factor.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvectors can be found by considering the permutations of the basis vectors. Alternatively, maybe it's block diagonal. But I don't see an obvious block structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix and some other terms. Let me compute P^2 to see if that helps.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to find the eigenvalues numerically.

So the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is:

| -λ    1/sqrt(2)    0     |
| 1/sqrt(2)  -λ   1/sqrt(2) |
| 0     1/sqrt(2)  -λ     |

Computing this determinant. Hmm, maybe expanding along the first row.

The determinant would be:
-λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2))] 
- 1/sqrt(2) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ]
+ 0 * [something, which doesn't matter]

So let's compute each part.

First term: -λ * [ λ^2 - (1/2) ]

Second term: -1/sqrt(2) * [ (-λ / sqrt(2)) - 0 ] = -1/sqrt(2) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) )= -1/sqrt(2) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ)/(2)

Third term: zero.

So the determinant equation becomes:

-λ (λ^2 - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) = 0.

Let me expand that:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

So -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor out λ: λ ( -λ^2 + 1 ) = 0.

So the equation is λ (1 - λ^2 ) = 0. Thus, the eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Oh, that's simpler! So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Now, the next step is to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue, particularly for λ=0, because the problem is about measuring P=0.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

For P - 0I = P:

[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0;
1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2);
0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

We need to solve (P)|v> = 0.

So the system of equations is:

1. 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0
2. (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1
3. 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2=0 (same as first equation)

So from equation 1, v2=0. From equation 3, same.

From equation 2, v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So we can write this as v1 [1, 0, -1]^T.

The eigenvector for λ=0 is proportional to [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, let me make sure. Because if v2 is zero, and v3 = -v1, then the vector is [1, 0, -1] scaled by any v1, so yes, the eigenvector is along [1; 0; -1].

But let me check if this vector is correct.

Plugging into P:

P * [1; 0; -1] = ?

First component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) = 0. So yes, the first component is zero.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = (1 -1)/sqrt(2) = 0. So second component is zero.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 +0*(-1) =0. So all components are zero, so yes, the vector [1;0;-1] is an eigenvector for λ=0.

So the eigenvector for P=0 is |p0> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 0; -1] because the norm squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2 → normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2). So |p0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Wait a second, but wait. Wait, let me compute the normalization. The vector [1, 0, -1] has squared norm 1 + 0 +1 = 2. So it's length is sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, we divide by sqrt(2), giving [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

Now, the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |ψ> in the direction of |p0>.

So the state |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T. Wait no, earlier I said |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) times that vector. So |ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

So the amplitude is the inner product of |p0> and |ψ>.

So the inner product is: [1/sqrt(2) , 0, -1/sqrt(2)] · [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

Calculating each term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Which is [ -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ].

So total: (-2)/(sqrt(12)) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but the problem asks for the probability of first measuring P=0 and then, in the subsequent measurement of Q, getting Q=-1.

So after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |p0>, which is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Now, we need to measure Q on this state. So what are the eigenvalues of Q? Let's look at the operator Q.

The operator Q is given as:

[
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

This is a diagonal matrix. So the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1.

So for Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors for Q are the standard basis vectors.

For eigenvalue 1: |q1> = [1, 0, 0]^T
Eigenvalue 0: |q0> = [0,1,0]^T
Eigenvalue -1: |q-1> = [0, 0, 1]^T.

So, if after the first measurement, the state is |p0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T, we now measure Q.

The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probability for each is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in |p0>.

So for Q=-1, the eigenvector is |q-1> = [0, 0, 1]^T.

The amplitude is the inner product of |p0> and |q-1>.

So [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] · [0,0,1] = (0) + (0) + (-1/sqrt(2) *1) = -1/sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.

Thus, the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Because when you measure P, the state collapses to |p0>, and then you measure Q in that state. So the probability for Q=-1 is 1/2, as calculated.

So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me double-check.

First, the normalization of |ψ> is correct: divided by sqrt(6).

Eigenvalues of P are 0,1,-1. The eigenvector for 0 is [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2). Correct.

The inner product of |p0> and |ψ> was correctly computed as (-1/sqrt(3)), so the modulus squared is 1/3. Correct.

Then, after measuring P=0, the state is |p0>, which is [1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)].

Measuring Q in this state: The inner product with |q-1> is -1/sqrt(2). The square is 1/2. So the probability is 1/2.

Multiplying the probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So the answer should be D) 1/6.


The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), in sequence on a quantum system. The state of the system is initially given as \( |ψ\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. Normalizing it, the state becomes:

\[
|ψ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, solve \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The characteristic equation simplifies to:

\[
\lambda (1 - \lambda^2) = 0,
\]

giving the eigenvalues \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is found by solving \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \), yielding:

\[
|p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |p_0\rangle \) in \( |ψ\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle p_0 | ψ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
\left| \langle p_0 | ψ \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 3: Measuring \( Q \) After \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |q_{-1}\rangle \) in \( |p_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle q_{-1} | p_0 \rangle = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
\left| \langle q_{-1} | p_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 4: Combined Probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\]

Answer: D
