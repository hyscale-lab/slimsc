Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and its observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The question is about figuring out the comoving distance to the quasar based on some given parameters. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. The observations show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and a significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than that. I remember that quasars can emit light across a wide range of wavelengths, but a peak in the infrared might indicate something about their redshift. Oh wait, because if the peak is in the infrared, it might mean that the emitted light was actually in the optical range but has been redshifted due to the expansion of the universe.

Right, so if the rest frame emission is in the optical and we see it in infrared, the wavelength has stretched. The rest wavelength (λ_rest) for optical light is typically around 500 nm to 700 nm. Let's say the rest wavelength is about 500 nm. Wait, but wait, the peak is at 790 nm, so the observed wavelength λ_obs is 790 nm. To find the redshift z, I can use the formula λ_obs = (1 + z) * λ_rest.

But wait, what if the rest wavelength is different? Like maybe the quasar emits peak at optical, say around 550 nm (green light). So 550 nm * (1 + z) = 790 nm. Let me compute that. So 1 + z = 790 / 550 ≈ 1.436. So z ≈ 0.436. Or maybe I should use a more typical rest wavelength for quasars? I'm not exactly sure, but I'll proceed with this calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is at 121 nm in rest. But if it's observed at 790 nm, that would imply (1 + z) = 790/121 ≈6.52. So z≈5.52. Wait, that seems very high. But quasars can have high redshifts. But wait, the question states that the flux drops significantly below 790 nm.
