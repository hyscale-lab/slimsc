Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, which is 1/plx^5. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r?

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, distance r is approximately 1/plx.

Wait, but the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So I need to express the number of stars (N) in terms of distance r.

Let me write down what I know. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since r ≈ 1/plx, then plx ≈ 1/r. Let me substitute that into the equation. So plx would be 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. 

So 1/(plx)^5 is 1/(1/r^5) which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, that would mean N increases as r^5. But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because as distance increases, I would think fewer stars are visible. But maybe in this specific case, the number increases with distance to the fifth power?

But wait, let me think again. If N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, and since 1/plx is r, then N ∝ r^5. So when r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. That's a very steep increase. So per unit distance, the number of stars would increase quite rapidly.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if you have a small change in r (like moving from r to r+dr), how does N change? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question says, per unit range of distance, how does N change. So perhaps the way N depends on r is the key. Since N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases with distance to the fifth power. So the correct option would be B) ~ r^5.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's go through it again.

Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/r.

So 1/(plx)^5 = (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

But wait, how can the number of stars increase with distance? Typically, stars become dimmer and fewer as you look further away. Unless this is a special scenario where the density of stars increases with distance, but I think the question is more about the mathematical relationship given.

So the question is about how N depends on r, given N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx =1/r. So substituting, N ∝ r^5. Therefore, the number of stars increases with r^5. So the answer should be option B.

But wait, let me check the options. The options are:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So B is r^5, which matches our conclusion. So I think the correct answer is B.


The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

This shows that the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( r^5 \), meaning \( N \) increases rapidly with distance. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of \( r \), and the relationship \( N \propto r^5 \) directly answers this. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct answer is **B**, as \( N \propto r^5 \). 

Answer: B
