Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The setup is about a spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor is uncharged initially, so it has no net charge. The cavity is small and spherical, and its center is separated by a distance 's' from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is 'r', and it's smaller than the conductor's radius 'R'. So the conductor is bigger, and the cavity is inside it but not at the center.

Then, a small positive charge '+q' is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P located outside the spherical conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from point P to the center of the cavity is 'l', and both L and l are larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A to D, each with a different expression for the electric field E.

Hmm, I remember something about conductors and charges inside cavities. Oh right! When you have a conductor, the charges reside on the outer surface. But if there's a cavity, the inner surface might have induced charges. Wait, but in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged, so any charges inside the cavity would induce opposite charges on the inner surface and the same on the outer surface. Or wait, let me think again.

So, the conductor is neutral (uncharged) to start with. When we place a charge '+q' inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge '-q' because the conductor is a conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge '+q' to balance it out. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize the setup. The conductor is a sphere of radius R. Inside it, somewhere, there's a cavity with radius r, whose center is at a distance 's' from the center of the conductor. So the cavity isn't at the center; it's off to one side. The charge '+q' is placed inside this cavity.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor (at point P, which is outside the conductor) would depend on the charge outside the conductor. Since the conductor's outer surface has a charge of '+q', the field outside should be as if the charge '+q' is located at the center of the conductor. Wait, no, wait. Because the conductor is a sphere, its outer surface's charge distributes uniformly. But wait, the cavity is off-center. Does that affect the distribution of charges on the outer surface?

Wait, no. In a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the outer surface are arranged such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Since the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface will uniformly distribute regardless of the inner cavity's position. Because any external fields due to the inner charge would be canceled by the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces. So, the outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed.

Wait, but the cavity's position is off-center. So, the induced charge on the inner surface would be '-q' and located at the cavity's surface, right? So the inner surface's charge is -q, and the outer surface is +q. So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field is as if the charge '+q' is at the center of the conductor because the outer surface's charge behaves as a point charge at the center, regardless of the inner cavity's position. Wait, no, wait. Because the outer surface is a shell, the field outside the conductor should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, the electric field at any point outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point P.

Wait, but the options don't all have L squared. Let me check the options again.

Option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). That's what I just thought. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared. Option C has (l + s cosθ) squared. Option D has l squared.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something about the setup. The point P is at distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance to the cavity's center is l. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm. So, the displacement from the cavity's center to point P is l, and the displacement from conductor's center to cavity's center is s. So, the positions are a bit more involved.

Wait, but the outer surface's charge is +q uniformly distributed. So, the electric field outside depends only on that charge and the distance from the conductor's center. So, the field at P should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), which is option B.

Wait, but why are the other options involving 'l' and 'theta' present? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the field inside the conductor. But no, the point P is outside. So the field outside should be the same as if the charge were at the center.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the cavity's position affects the distribution of the outer charges. But no, the outer surface should still have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is a sphere. Any external field would be created as if the charge is at the center, so the field at P would only depend on L, the distance from the center.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of it another way. Imagine the conductor is a shell, with a cavity inside. The cavity has a charge q. The induced charges on the inner surface are -q, and the outer surface is +q. So, the external field is due to the +q on the outer surface, which is a spherical shell. Therefore, the field outside would be E = k q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

So option B is correct.

Wait, but why are other options involving 'l' and 's' present? Maybe because someone might think that the field is due to the charge inside the cavity, not considering the conductor's response. But no, because the conductor's response is to have +q on the outer surface, so the field at any external point is that of a point charge at the center.

Wait, another way to think about it: the charge inside the cavity is +q, but the conductor's inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface +q. So the net effect is that the conductor's exterior behaves as if it has a charge of +q, and the field outside is as if that charge is at the center.

So, the correct expression is option B, because E = k q / L².

Hmm, but let me think about the positions. The point P is at L from the conductor's center, and l from the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. But since the conductor's outer surface charge is uniformly distributed, the field at P would depend only on the total charge and the distance L. So the other factors (l and theta) don't matter because the field is as if all the charge is at the center.

So, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves a neutral spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is at a distance \( s \) from the conductor's center, and the charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, which is at a distance \( L \) from the conductor's center and \( l \) from the cavity's center. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

When the charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface develops an induced charge \( -q \), and the outer surface develops a charge \( +q \) to maintain the conductor's neutrality. The charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly because the conductor is a sphere, and the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, \( +q \), and the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center.

The electric field outside a charged spherical shell is given by \( E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \), where \( L \) is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point \( P \). The other options involving \( l \), \( s \), and \( \theta \) are incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the outer surface and the distance \( L \), not on the position of the cavity or the angle \( \theta \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
