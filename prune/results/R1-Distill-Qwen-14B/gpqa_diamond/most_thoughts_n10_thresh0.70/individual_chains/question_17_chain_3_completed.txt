Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are ideal pH and temperature at 25°C. The formation constant, K_CA-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the right one.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

So the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think the complex is [Ca(EDTA)]^2- or something similar, and when it dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dissociation equation. Let me think. The formation reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, right? So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, we're given the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M. So, initially, all of that is the complex, and it dissociates a little bit, releasing some Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the problem says "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex." Oh right, that probably means that the concentration of the complex is such that the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1. So each formula unit of the complex contributes one Ca and one EDTA.

Wait, no, the complex is Ca-EDTA, so each complex has one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4- forming the complex. So when it dissociates, it releases those ions.

But when the complex dissociates, the K is the formation constant. So we can write the dissociation as CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this dissociation would be 1/Kf, because Kf is for the formation.

So, Kdissociate = 1/(Kf) = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, that makes sense because if Kf is very large, the complex is very stable, so the dissociation constant is very small. So the complex doesn't dissociate much, meaning the concentration of free Ca^2+ is low.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's call that C. So, at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex will be approximately C - x, but since Kdissociate is so small, x will be really tiny, so C - x ≈ C. So, we can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, no, wait. Let me set it up properly.

Let me denote the initial concentration of the complex as C. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = C = 0.02 M.

Then, when it dissociates, let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- produced. So:

[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x
[CaEDTA^2-] = C - x ≈ C (since x is very small compared to C)

So, using the dissociation equation:

Kdissociate = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = x^2 / (C)

So, x^2 = Kdissociate * C

Plugging in the numbers:

x^2 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 2e-11 * 2e-2 = 4e-13

So x^2 = 4e-13

Taking the square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-6.5), which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again. Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. Wait, 10^-13 is (10^-6.5)^2? Let me think. 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 times that would be 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, Kdissociate = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Correct.

C is 0.02 M.

x^2 = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Yes, that makes sense. So option C is the correct concentration of Ca^2+.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium. The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_{\text{dissociate}} \) is related to the formation constant \( K_{\text{f}} \) by:

\[
K_{\text{dissociate}} = \frac{1}{K_{\text{f}}}
\]

Given \( K_{\text{f}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_{\text{dissociate}} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The initial concentration of the complex is \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium. Using the dissociation equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{dissociate}} = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \), \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \), and \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02 M):

\[
K_{\text{dissociate}} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_{\text{dissociate}} \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
