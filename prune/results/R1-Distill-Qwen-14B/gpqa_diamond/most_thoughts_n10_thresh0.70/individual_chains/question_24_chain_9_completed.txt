Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem is about some mixtures and reactions. I'll try to outline what's given.

So, there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Hmm, substances that decolorize bromine water usually have double bonds because they undergo addition reactions with bromine. So, mixture X probably has alkenes or maybe something else like phenols, but phenols might not be likely since mixture Y comes from a reaction involving X.

Then, X is treated with platinum when heated. Platinum is a catalyst, so this is probably a hydrogenation reaction. But wait, wait. Wait, the result is a mixture Y which is formed through disproportionation, and Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Disproportionation is when a single species undergoes both oxidation and reduction. But wait, mixture Y is formed from X. So maybe the two components of X each undergo a reaction, perhaps with each other?

Wait, the problem says that when X is heated with platinum, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So each component of X is part of the same reaction? Or perhaps the two components in X each undergo a reaction. Hmm, not sure yet.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. And Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's likely fully saturated—maybe an alkane.

So, I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me start by figuring out what Z is.

Hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's calculate its molecular formula.

Hydrogen mass fraction is about 14.28%, so carbon must be the rest.

Hydrogen: 14.28% → 14.28/100 = 0.1428. Let's assume the molecule is CnHm.

The molar mass of Z is (12n + m *1) g/mol.

Hydrogen's mass is m *1 / (12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let me try to find n and m such that this holds.

Let me assume it's a simple molecule. Let's try m=28 since 14.28 is 1/7. Maybe m=28, which would be 28 H atoms.

Wait, 28 H would be 28 *1 =28. So the total mass is 12n +28.

28/(12n +28) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

28 = 0.1428*(12n +28)

0.1428 ≈ 1/7.

So 28 = (1/7)(12n +28) → multiply both sides by 7:

196 = 12n +28 → 12n=168 → n=14.

So the formula would be C14H28. But that's a pretty big molecule. Hmm, but it doesn't have to have 28 H; maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, let's try another approach. 14.28% is approximately 1/7. So the fraction of H is 1/7. So if the molecular formula is CHx, then (x)/(12 +x) =1/7.

Cross multiplying: 7x = 12 +x → 6x=12 → x=2. So CH₂? No, that's not possible because if it's CH₂, the molecule would be CH₂, but that's not a stable molecule. Hmm, maybe it's a bigger molecule.

Wait, maybe m is 30? Let me see:

30/(12n +30) = 0.1428 → 30 = 0.1428*(12n+30)

Multiply both sides by 7: 210 = 12n +30 → 12n=180 → n=15. So C15H30.

But wait, that's a very long alkane. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.

Wait, another way: The mass of H is 14.28%, which is 1/7 of the total mass. So for each mole of Z, the mass is 12n + m, and mass of H is m*1. So m/(12n +m) = 1/7 → 7m =12n +m →6m=12n → m=2n.

So, m=2n.

So possible n and m where m=2n.

Looking for a hydrocarbon where the number of H is twice the number of C.

So, for n=1, m=2 → CH₂ (but that's not possible for a neutral molecule).

n=2, m=4 → C2H4. Let's check the fraction: 4/(24+4)=4/28=1/7≈14.28%. Oh! Yes, that works. So Z is C2H4? No, wait, wait, no. Because C2H4 is ethylene. But earlier, when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which doesn't react further with H2. If Z is ethylene, which is an alkene, it would decolorize bromine water, but the problem says that mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine. Wait, but the problem says that X can decolorize bromine, but Y can't. So, perhaps Z is an alkane.

Wait, but according to our calculation, Z is C2H4, which is an alkene. But that would still decolorize bromine. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. If Z has 14.28% H, then let's recalculate.

14.28% is 0.1428.

Assume Z is a hydrocarbon with formula CnHm.

So:

m / (12n + m) = 0.1428 → m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

Let me rearrange that equation:

m = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428 m → m -0.1428 m = 0.1428 * 12n → 0.8572 m = 1.7136 n → m ≈ (1.7136/0.8572) * n → approximately 2 n.

So m ≈ 2n.

So what hydrocarbons have m=2n?

For n=1: m=2 → CH₂ → Not possible.

n=2: m=4 → C₂H₄ → ethylene. But that's an alkene.

But Z is a constituent of Y, and Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So Z must not have any double bonds. Because if Z were ethylene, it would react with bromine.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. So if Z is ethylene, and it's hydrogenated, it would form ethane, which is an alkane. But in the problem, hydrogenation of X and Y gives only Z. That suggests that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So if X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two other alkenes? Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe Z is ethane, which is C2H6. Let's check the hydrogen percentage.

C2H6: H mass is 6/(24+6)=6/30=0.2 → 20%. That's not matching 14.28%.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the exact value.

0.1428 is approximately 1/7.

So, 1/7 = m/(12n + m) → 12n +m =7m → 12n =6m → 2n = m.

So the formula is CnH2n.

Which is a general formula for alkenes (if it's a single double bond) or for cycloalkanes.

Wait, but if Z is an alkane, the formula would be CnH2n+2.

So, in that case, m=2n+2.

Then, m/(12n + m) = (2n+2)/(12n +2n +2) )= (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 2(n+1)/(2(7n+1)) )= (n+1)/(7n+1).

Set this equal to 0.1428, which is 1/7.

So (n+1)/(7n+1) = 1/7 → 7(n+1) =7n +1 → 7n +7 =7n +1 → 7=1 → Contradiction. So it can't be an alkane.

Hmm, so Z must be an alkene. But then, since Z is part of Y and Y doesn't decolorize bromine, that can't be right because alkenes do decolorize bromine.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem says that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. So Y has no double bonds, but Z is a hydrocarbon that does not react further with H2. So if Z is an alkane, it wouldn't react with H2 anymore, but if Z were an alkene, it would react more. But since Z doesn't react further, it must be an alkane.

But earlier calculation with formula CnHm where m=2n gives 14.28% H. So Z is C2H4. But that's an alkene, which would react with bromine. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Z can't be an alkene.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Let me recalculate Z's formula.

Let me let the percentage of H be 14.28%, which is exactly 1/7.

So,

H% = (m) / (12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m =12n +m → 6m=12n → m=2n.

So, the formula is CnH2n.

That's either an alkene or a cycloalkane. Either way, it has a double bond or ring.

If Z is an alkene, then when Y is formed, perhaps from X via hydrogenation, but then why would Y not decolorize bromine? Wait, wait, no. The problem says that X is treated with Pt and heated to form Y via disproportionation. Then, X and Y are hydrogenated to give Z.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two diols or something else after hydrogenation. Wait, but the problem says Y is formed via disproportionation.

Wait, another angle: X is a mixture of two alkenes. When treated with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo hydrogenation, but wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation. Oh wait, but if X is a mixture, perhaps each component undergoes a different reaction.

Wait, wait, the problem says that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. When treated with Pt and heated, undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So Y is a mixture of two other liquids in equimolar amounts.

Wait, but what kind of reaction is a disproportionation involving two different reactants? Maybe each undergoes a change. Hmm, perhaps one part is being hydrogenated more than the other?

Wait, let me think again. Maybe X consists of two alkenes, perhaps 1,3-butadiene and something else. Oh wait, but if they undergo hydrogenation, it would form butane and another alkane. But then Y would be a mixture of two alkanes, which wouldn't decolorize bromine. That makes sense.

Wait, but the problem states that Y is formed via a disproportionation. So maybe the alkenes in X are such that when they react, they form a new set of alkanes, but that might not be a disproportionation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different alkenes, but when treated with Pt and heat, each undergoes a reaction that changes their structure, perhaps leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the components in X is a diene, and the other is a different alkene. When hydrogenated, they form alkanes, which are in Y. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. So, a single reactant undergoing disproportionation to form two products. But X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each of the two components in X undergoes a different disproportionation reaction.

Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to think differently.

Let me focus on Z. Since Z is a constituent of Y and is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H, and it's an alkane (since it doesn't react further with H2), perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe Z is not C2H4 but something else. Let me try another approach.

Let me compute the exact value for Z. Let me set up the equation again:

(m) / (12n + m) = 14.28% = 0.1428

So,

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Multiply both sides by 1000 to eliminate decimals:

1000m = 142.8*(12n + m)

1000m = 142.8*12n + 142.8 m

1000m - 142.8m = 1713.6n

857.2 m = 1713.6 n

Divide both sides by 1713.6:

(857.2 / 1713.6) m = n

Let me compute 857.2 /1713.6:

Approximately, 857.2 ≈ 857, 1713.6 ≈1714.

857/1714 ≈ 0.5 (since 1714 ≈ 2 *857)

So n ≈ 0.5 m.

So m = 2n.

So, again, m=2n.

So back to the same conclusion.

So the formula is CnH2n.

Which is either an alkene or cycloalkane.

But Z is a constituent of Y, and Y doesn't decolorize. So if Z is an alkene, Y would have to not have any other alkenes, but I'm confused.

Wait, but maybe Z is a cycloalkane, like cyclopropane. Let's see. If Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6.

Wait, let's compute the H% for C3H6: 6/(36+6) =6/42=1/7≈14.28%. Oh! So that's exactly the value given.

So Z is cyclopropane (C3H6). So n=3, m=6.

So, Z is C3H6. That's a cyclopropane, which is an alkane (as it's a saturated ring) and doesn't have any double bonds, so it wouldn't decolorize bromine water. But wait, cyclopropane is a ring with three carbons, which is a cycloalkane. So it's saturated and doesn't have double bonds, so it won't decolorize bromine.

Wait, but wait—cyclopropane doesn't have double bonds but is strained. So when hydrogenated, it would require more energy. But in the problem, when X is hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z.

So, if Z is cyclopropane, which is a cyclic alkane, then X must have been a mixture of alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane and possibly another compound.

Wait, no. Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids, and when treated with Pt and heat, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. Then, X and Y are hydrogenated to give Z.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reactions.

So X is a mixture of two alkenes (since they decolorize bromine). When X is treated with Pt and heat, a disproportionation occurs. Disproportionation is a reaction where a single species is both oxidized and reduced. But here, X is a mixture, so perhaps each component undergoes a reaction.

Wait, maybe one of the components in X is a more substituted alkene, and the other is less substituted. Upon hydrogenation, perhaps they form different products. But how does that lead to a disproportionation?

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different alkenes, and when heated with Pt, they undergo a reaction where one is hydrogenated more than the other.

Wait, but the problem says that Y is formed via disproportionation, which is a type of reaction where a single substance breaks down into two different substances. So perhaps one component of X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction to form two products.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that on hydrogenation form a single product. But in this case, the problem says that Y is formed from X via a reaction, not hydrogenation.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of possible candidates.

If Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), then when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So X must have been a mixture that upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane. Wait, hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds. If X's components are dienes or something else, their hydrogenation would form alkanes.

But Z is C3H6, which is a cycloalkane, not an alkene. So perhaps the components in X are such that upon hydrogenation, they form cyclopropane and another alkane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of ethylene and another alkene. Upon hydrogenation, ethylene becomes ethane (C2H6), and another becomes, say, C4H10. But then, when Y is treated with H2, they would produce alkanes. But in the problem, hydrogenation of X and Y gives only Z. So maybe X's components, upon hydrogenation, give Z, and Y's components also upon hydrogenation give Z. That suggests that all components are leading to Z.

Wait, but Y is formed from X via a reaction, and then both X and Y are hydrogenated to form Z. So, perhaps in X, each component upon hydrogenation gives Z. And Y, which is formed from X, upon hydrogenation also gives Z.

So, X could be a mixture of two alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives Z.

Wait, but that would mean that both alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation leads to the same Z. Hmm, perhaps if Z is a di-substituted alkane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,3-butadiene and another diene. Upon hydrogenation, they both form butane, but that's not matching Z.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane. So, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible structure of X.

X is a mixture of two alkenes, which when hydrogenated give Z (C3H6). So each alkene in X must have a structure that upon hydrogenation yields C3H6.

Wait, but to hydrogenate to C3H6, perhaps the alkenes are in a way that when H2 is added, they form cyclopropane. But wait, hydrogenation typically adds H2 across double bonds, leading to alkanes. For example, ethylene becomes ethane, propene becomes propane, etc.

But cyclopropane is a ring structure. So how would that form upon hydrogenation of an alkene? Unless the starting material was a diene, which upon hydrogenation forms a ring. Hmm, but that might require some specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps X consists of two alkenes, and when hydrogenated, they form the same alkane. But then, if Z is an alkane, like propane (C3H8), but that doesn't match the 14.28% H. Let me check:

C3H8: H mass is 8/(36+8)=8/44≈18.18%, which is higher than 14.28%. So that can't be Z.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggests that Z is C3H6. So 6/(36+6)=6/42≈14.28%. So yes, that's correct.

So Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), which is a saturated compound and won't react with H2 further.

So, X is a mixture that upon hydrogenation gives Z (C3H6). So X must be a mixture of alkenes that upon hydrogenation become cyclopropane.

But how?

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X contains a cyclic diene that upon hydrogenation would form cyclopropane.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,2-dienes or something, but this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which is a cyclic structure. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction where X is treated with Pt and heated to form Y via a disproportionation.

So, X has two alkenes. One of them undergoes a reaction to form a more hydrogenated product, and another perhaps becomes something else.

Wait, but the problem says it's a disproportionation. So one component is oxidized and another is reduced. But since Pt is a catalyst, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the alkenes in X is more substituted and upon hydrogenation becomes a more substituted alkane, while another becomes a less substituted. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, say, 1-pentene and another. When heated with Pt, perhaps one isomerizes or something.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it from another angle.

Since Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that each, when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. But that doesn't make much sense because hydrogenation would typically add H2 across a double bond to form an alkane, not a ring.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that can each form cyclopropane upon hydrogenation under certain conditions. Let me think—what alkenes would form cyclopropane upon hydrogenation? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are such that when hydrogenated, they form a ring, but that's not typical. Usually, hydrogenation just adds H across the double bond.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of 1-propene and another alkene. Upon hydrogenation, 1-propene becomes propane (C3H8), which has a higher H% than 14.28%. So that can't be Z.

But earlier, Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane. So maybe the alkenes in X, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

Wait, but how? Perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a cyclic structure. Like, maybe one is a cyclopropane derivative with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that when H2 is added, it forms a ring. For example, if you have a diene like 1,3-butadiene, hydrogenation would form butane (C4H10), which has a H% of 10/58≈17.24%, not matching.

Hmm, maybe I need to take a different approach.

Let me consider the possible structures for X. Since X can decolorize bromine, it's likely a mixture of alkenes. When treated with Pt and heat, a disproportionation occurs, leading to Y. Then, both X and Y hydrogenate to Z, which is C3H6.

So, perhaps X contains 1,3-butadiene and another diene. Wait, but upon hydrogenation, 1,3-butadiene would become butane, which doesn't match Z.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane. But I'm not seeing how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes, each with a double bond that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a ring. For example, maybe one is a cyclohexene, which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But that's a larger molecule.

Wait, but Z is C3H6. So maybe X's alkenes, when hydrogenated, produce cyclopropane. But then, perhaps X is a mixture of two strained alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options given for the number of H atoms in X.

The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. Each is an alkene. Let's say each has the formula CnH2n. Because alkenes have the formula CnH2n.

So each component in X is CnH2n. Since X is a mixture of two alkenes, perhaps they have the same or different n.

When each is hydrogenated, they add two H's to each double bond, forming CnH2n+2.

But wait, if Z is C3H6, which is a cyclopropane, then perhaps the alkenes in X are such that upon hydrogenation, they form cyclopropane.

Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkene typically adds H2 across the double bond to form an alkane.

Cyclopropane is a ring, so maybe the alkenes in X are part of a ring. For example, if X has a cyclopropane with a double bond, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But I'm not seeing how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that when hydrogenated, they lose a hydrogen and form a ring. Hmm, but that's not typical of hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1-propene and another alkene. Wait, but 1-propene hydrogenates to propane (C3H8), which doesn't match Z's formula. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives the same product, Z. Then, each alkene in X must have the same number of carbons and the same structure upon hydrogenation.

For example, X could be a mixture of 1-pentene and cis-1-pentene or something, but that's not necessary.

Wait, but Z is C3H6. So, each alkene in X must have three carbons. So X is a mixture of two alkenes with three carbons each. So their formula would be C3H6 each.

Wait, but there are two alkenes with three carbons. The possible alkenes for C3H6 are propene (CH₂=CHCH3) and cyclopropane, but cyclopropane is already Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Wait, but no—cyclopropane is a cyclic alkane, not an alkene.

Wait, no. C3H6 exists as propene (an alkene) and cyclopropane (a cycloalkane). So if X is a mixture of propene and something else, but that doesn't fit because X is a mixture of two alkenes. So, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, then Z must be their hydrogenated forms.

But if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with C3H6, then upon hydrogenation, they would form C3H8. But Z is C3H6, which is a cyclopropane. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about mixture Y.

Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. So, perhaps X has an alkene that undergoes a reaction to form two different products.

Wait, a common example of a disproportionation reaction is the reaction of H2O2 to form H2O and O2. But in the case of alkenes, perhaps one part is hydrogenated more than the other. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and a diene. Upon heating with Pt, the diene may undergo some reaction to form a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,3-butadiene and another diene, but this seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the total number of H atoms in X.

X is a mixture of two alkenes. Each alkene has a formula CnH2n.

So, for each compound, the number of H atoms is 2n. So, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, say, with n1 and n2 carbons, the total H atoms would be 2n1 + 2n2.

But the question is asking for the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X.

Wait, but the mixture is equimolar. So the moles are same for both components. So the total H atoms would be (2n1 + 2n2) per two moles of X.

Wait, no. For each mole of each component, the number of H atoms is 2n. So, if X is a 1:1 mixture, then for each mole of X, each component contributes 2n H atoms.

Wait, perhaps each component has the same number of H atoms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So, for each mole of X, there are 0.5 moles of each component. So, the total H atoms per mole of X would be 0.5*(2n1) + 0.5*(2n2) )= (n1 +n2).

But to find the total H atoms in two liquids of X, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of H atoms in both components, not per mole. So it's the sum of H atoms for each component in X.

Wait, but the problem states it's an equimolar mixture. So, if each component has m H atoms, and the mixture is equimolar, then for 1 mole of X, each component contributes 0.5 moles. So the total H atoms per mole of X would be (m1 *0.5 + m2 *0.5 ), where m1 and m2 are the number of H per mole of each component.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all H atoms in the two components of X, regardless of moles. But since they're equimolar, perhaps each contributes the same number of H.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Let me think about the answer options. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

If X consists of two alkenes, each with formula CnH2n.

If each is C2H4 (ethylene), then each has 4 H atoms. So for two moles (since equimolar mixture), each contributes 4 H. So total H would be 4 +4=8. But that's not an option.

Wait, wait. Wait, if each component is C3H6, which is an alkene, then each has 6 H atoms. Two moles would have 12 H. But that's option D)12. But earlier, I thought Z was C3H6, which would be cyclopropane, but that's an alkane. So perhaps X is a mixture of two C3H6 alkenes, but that would make Z C3H8, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is C2H4. Each has 4 H, so two components would have 8 H. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps each component is C4H8. Each has 8 H. So two components would have 16 H. Which is option A)16.

But then, when hydrogenated, C4H8 would become C4H10. But Z is C3H6, so that's not matching.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane. So how does that fit?

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of C2H4 and C4H8. Each, when hydrogenated, would form ethane (C2H6) and butane (C4H10). But then, Z would have to be both, but the problem says only one substance Z is formed. So that can't be.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Since the problem states that no conjugated multiple bonds are in X's molecules. So each component of X is a single alkene, not conjugated dienes.

So, each has a single double bond, so each is CnH2n.

When each is hydrogenated, they form CnH2n+2.

So, for each component, upon hydrogenation, it's CnH2n → CnH2n+2.

But when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is a single substance.

So, all components of X and Y must hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, but Y is formed from X via a reaction. So perhaps Y is a mixture of the products of X's components upon some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two diols or something else. But no, Y is formed via a disproportionation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is that the alkenes in X are hydrogenated to form alkanes, but under certain conditions, they undergo some isomerization.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X undergo some kind of addition or rearrangement to form different products.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to think about the possible structures that could lead to Z being C3H6.

If Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, then when X is hydrogenated, it produces cyclopropane. So, X must be a mixture of alkenes that each, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

But how?

Wait, perhaps X contains a cyclopropane with a double bond, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, lose some carbons to form cyclopropane. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which has three carbons. For example, propene (C3H6) and another isomer.

Wait, but propene is C3H6, which is an alkene. If X is a mixture of two C3H6 alkenes, but that can't be because propene is the only C3H6 alkene. So perhaps X is a mixture of propene and another alkene with a different structure.

But I'm stuck again.

Wait, maybe I should conclude that Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), and X consists of two alkenes that when hydrogenated give cyclopropane. But I can't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1-pentene and another alkene, but upon hydrogenation, they form cyclopropane. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane or something, but that doesn't fit.

Another thought: Maybe the alkenes in X are such that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane via a ring-closing reaction. For example, if X contains a diene that upon hydrogenation forms a ring.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the information given.

So, Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane. When X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So X must be a mixture of alkenes that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane.

But I don't see how that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes each with 3 carbons, and when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane.

Wait, but 3 carbons with a double bond would be propene (C3H6), which upon hydrogenation becomes propane (C3H8), not cyclopropane.

So, perhaps I'm wrong about Z's structure.

Wait, perhaps Z is ethane, which is C2H6. Let me check the H%: 6/(24+6)=6/30=0.2 → 20%, which is not 14.28%. So no.

Alternatively, maybe Z is butane (C4H10). H% is 10/(56+10)=10/66≈15.15%, which is close but not exactly 14.28%.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the exact value of 14.28% as a fraction.

14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, the H fraction is 1/7.

So, if Z is CnHm, then m/(12n + m) =1/7 →7m=12n +m →6m=12n →m=2n.

So, m=2n.

So, the formula is CnH2n.

Which is either an alkene (if it's a single bond) or a cycloalkane.

So, for n=3, m=6 → C3H6, which is propene or cyclopropane.

But earlier, I thought Z is cyclopropane, which is a cycloalkane and doesn't react further with H2.

So, the alkenes in X must, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane.

But I'm not seeing how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of H atoms in X.

If each component in X is an alkene with a formula CnH2n, then each has 2n H atoms.

Since X is a mixture of two such alkenes, and they're equimolar, the total H atoms would be 2n1 + 2n2.

But the question asks for the total number of H atoms in two liquids of X. So, perhaps it's 2n1 + 2n2.

Looking at the options: 16,18,22,12.

So, possible combinations where 2n1 + 2n2 equals one of these.

For 16: 2(n1 +n2)=16 →n1 +n2=8.

Possible n1=3, n2=5 →3+5=8 →2*3 +2*5=6+10=16.

For 18: n1 +n2=9. So, 2(n1 +n2)=18.

For 22: n1 +n2=11. 22 is option C.

For 12: n1 +n2=6 → 2(n1 +n2)=12. Option D.

So, which option is correct?

If Z is C3H6, then perhaps the alkenes in X are C3H6 and another alkene.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because C3H6 is an alkene. So when X is hydrogenated, it would form C3H8, but then Z wouldn't be C3H6.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is C2H4. So two components would each have 4 H. So 4+4=8, which is not an option.

Alternatively, maybe each component is C4H8. Each has 8 H, so two would have 16 H. So option A is 16.

But if X is a mixture of two C4H8 alkenes, then upon hydrogenation, they'd form C4H10, which isn't Z.

So, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, another thought: The problem states that mixture Y doesn’t decolorize bromine. So Y has no double bonds. So Y must be a mixture of alkanes.

When X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of alkanes.

So, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon reaction with Pt and heat (a hydrogenation) become alkanes, but also undergo some other reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,3-butadiene and another diene. When heated with Pt, they undergo hydrogenation to form alkanes. But how does that lead to Y via a disproportionation?

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

If each component in X is C3H6 (propene), then each has 6 H atoms. Two components would have 12 H. So option D)12.

But then, when X is hydrogenated, it would form C3H8, which doesn't match Z's H percentage.

So that can't be.

Wait, but the problem states that when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So if X is C3H6, upon hydrogenation it becomes C3H8, which has 20% H, not 14.28%.

Thus, this can't be.

Another approach: Let's think that each component in X is an alkene with the formula CnH2n.

Upon hydrogenation, they form CnH2n+2.

Since Z is CnH2n+2, and its H% is 14.28%, let's compute that.

H% = (2n+2)/(12n +2n +2) )= (2n+2)/(14n +2 )= 2(n+1)/(2(7n +1)) )= (n+1)/(7n +1).

Set this equal to 1/7:

(n+1)/(7n +1) = 1/7 →7(n+1)=7n +1 →7n +7 =7n +1 →7=1 → Contradiction. So Z can't be an alkane.

So earlier calculation must have been wrong. Thus, Z is an alkene, perhaps C3H6 (propene), which when hydrogenated, becomes propane (C3H8), but that doesn't fit the 14.28% H.

Hmm... I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the initial calculation where Z is C3H6, which is propene. But that would mean that Y would still have double bonds, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine.

Wait, no—Y doesn't have any double bonds. So perhaps Z is not an alkene, but a cyclopropane.

So, back to the drawing board.

If Z is cyclopropane (C3H6), which is a saturated compound, then the alkenes in X, upon hydrogenation, must form cyclopropane.

But I can't see how that would happen. Maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that each, when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane via some ring-closing reaction.

But I'm not familiar with such a reaction. Maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's not hydrogenation.

I think I'm stuck and I might have to make a guess. Given the options, if each component in X is C2H4, then two components would have 4 H each, so 8 H total. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, if each is C4H8, then each has 8 H, so total 16 H. Option A is 16.

So I'll go with option A)16.


The problem involves analyzing a series of reactions and determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes.
   - When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, indicating Y contains no double bonds (i.e., Y is a mixture of alkanes).
   - Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions produces only one substance, Z, a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is fully saturated (an alkane).

2. **Determining Z**:
   - The hydrogen mass fraction of Z is 14.28%, which corresponds to a fraction of 1/7. Using the formula for hydrogen mass fraction:
     \[
     \frac{m}{12n + m} = \frac{1}{7}
     \]
     where \(m\) is the number of hydrogen atoms and \(n\) is the number of carbon atoms. Solving this gives \(m = 2n\), meaning Z has the formula \(C_nH_{2n}\).
   - Z is identified as cyclopropane (\(C_3H_6\)), which is a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon and does not react further with hydrogen.

3. **Hydrogenation of X**:
   - X is a mixture of two alkenes (\(C_nH_{2n}\)), which upon hydrogenation form Z (\(C_3H_6\)). This implies that the alkenes in X must hydrogenate to form cyclopropane. However, this is unusual because hydrogenation typically converts alkenes to alkanes. The problem likely assumes that the alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation results in cyclopropane.

4. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - Each alkene in X has the general formula \(C_nH_{2n}\). For two alkenes with \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) carbons, the total number of hydrogen atoms is \(2n_1 + 2n_2\).
   - Considering the options provided (16, 18, 22, 12), the most plausible scenario is that each alkene in X has 4 hydrogen atoms (e.g., ethylene, \(C_2H_4\)). For two such alkenes, the total number of hydrogen atoms is \(4 + 4 = 8\). However, this does not match the options. Reassessing, if each alkene has 8 hydrogen atoms (e.g., \(C_4H_8\)), the total for two alkenes would be \(8 + 8 = 16\), which matches option A.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the reasoning and the options provided, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **16**.
