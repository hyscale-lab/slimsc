Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics, so let me think.

The question gives me five stars, each with their own parameters. The key point is that each spectrograph can only observe stars up to a certain apparent magnitude. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag (so apparent V magnitude less than 17), and HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17, that means its V mag is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag ≤17, because brighter (higher flux) means lower magnitude. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag ≤16.

But wait, no! The way it's written: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh wait, no, actually, in astronomy, "brighter than" refers to lower magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17, its V mag is less than 17. So the observable range for ESPRESSO is V ≤17. For HIRES, V ≤16.

So any star that has an apparent V magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and any with apparent V ≤16 can be seen by HIRES. So for a star to be detectable by both, its V mag must be ≤16. Because HIRES can't see beyond 16; anything beyond that can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the wording again. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh wait, no—brighter than 17 would be magnitude less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars as faint as 17 mag. Because, for example, a star with V=17 is at the limit; anything brighter (lower magnitude) is visible. So the observable range for
