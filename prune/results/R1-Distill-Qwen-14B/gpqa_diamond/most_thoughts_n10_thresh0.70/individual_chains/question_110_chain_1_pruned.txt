Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which pair is correct. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should understand the problem. It's about detecting stars using ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key is their apparent V magnitudes because the spectrographs have different brightness limits. So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent magnitude (if not already given) and see if it's bright enough for both instruments.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. Wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes, right? So if a star is brighter (lower mag), it's easier to see. So for detection, the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Because anything brighter than those (lower mag) would be detectable.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, but wait, 'brighter than' is a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, a star that's brighter has a lower apparent magnitude. For example, a magnitude 15 star is brighter than a 16 mag star.

So, if the instrument can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with apparent mag ≤17. Because anything above that (like 18, 19, etc.) is dimmer and not detectable. Wait, no, wait. Let's think again.

The way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star is brighter (lower mag) than 17, then it's visible. So the maximum apparent magnitude for ESPRESSO is 17. So any star with V ≤17 is detectable.

Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16 mag. So stars with V ≤16 mag can be observed by HIRES.

So a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, no, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So, the apparent V mag must be ≤17 (can be detected by ESPRESSO) and also ≤16 (can be detected by HIRES). Because if the star is brighter than 16 (like 16.5), then ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <17) but HIRES can't (because HIRES can only see up to 16). Wait, no. Wait, the way the question is phrased, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, for ESPRESSO, if a star's apparent V is brighter (lower) than 17, it's observed. So the limit is
