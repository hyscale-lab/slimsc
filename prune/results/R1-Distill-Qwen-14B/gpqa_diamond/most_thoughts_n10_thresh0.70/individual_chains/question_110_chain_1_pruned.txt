Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question is asking which stars can be observed with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key here is that each spectrograph has a different brightness limit for the stars they can observe. 

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait: the question says "brighter than 17 mag" can be observed. Wait, magnitude is a tricky scale. Oh right, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter stars. So a star with a V magnitude less than 17 is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag? Or brighter than 17? Hmm, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star is brighter (lower magnitude) than 17, it's observable. Wait, but that would mean the limit is 17, so it can observe up to 17? Or up to brighter than that? Wait the text says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star is 17 mag, that's the limit. Like, if a star is magnitude 17, ESPRESSO can't observe it? Or can it?

Wait, no.
