Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through each step carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are provided. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a bit upfield for an -OH group but maybe it's an alcohol, but wait, the IR would show a broad peak for OH. Alternatively, the 1720 cm⁻¹ could be a ketone. Wait, but if it's a ketone, the -CO- would have neighboring protons. Let me think: in the NMR, 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be adjacent to a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because epoxides usually have protons around 3.5-4.5, but more deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but that might show a broad peak. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when dibromides react with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, they can form alkenes via elimination. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a diamondoid structure with each carbon connected to three others). So when KOH is used in excess and heated, it's likely an E2 elimination, producing an alkene. But wait, the product is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. But KOH is a strong base, so more likely elimination. But elimination would give an alkene, which wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone? Wait, no, because to form a ketone, you'd need to lose two equivalents of HBr from adjacent
