Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid. From the NMR and IR data, I need to figure out what this product is.

IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That peak is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. But since we're using KOH, which is a strong base, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in an adamantane structure. Heating with KOH (a strong base) sounds like an E2 elimination. But wait, elimination usually forms alkenes, which might not have a carbonyl. Hmm, wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but maybe in the adamantane structure, the elimination leads to a carbonyl? Alternatively, could it be a substitution reaction?

Wait, KOH is used in substitution. If it's a double substitution, perhaps. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on adjacent carbons, but in adamantane, the structure is quite rigid. So when you heat with KOH, maybe two eliminations happen. Each Br is replaced by an -OH group. Wait, but that would give 1,3-diol. But then why the IR peak at 1720? Diols don't have carbonyls. Hmm.

Wait, maybe a different reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So two eliminations would form a double bond. But in the case of adamantane, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of an allene or a conjugated diene? Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3, so eliminating two HBr molecules would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C2 and C3? Or wait, maybe it's a single
