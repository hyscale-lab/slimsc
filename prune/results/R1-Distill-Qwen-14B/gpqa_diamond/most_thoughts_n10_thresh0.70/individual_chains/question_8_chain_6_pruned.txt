Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) involved in white lupine resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've created knockout mutants and double mutants, and tested their resistance. The results are given, and I need to choose the correct conclusion about their interactions from the options provided.

So, first, I should remember what each term in the options means. Let me jot down some definitions to get clear:

- Transcription Factor: A protein that helps regulate the expression of genes by binding to nearby DNA.
- Pleiotropy: When a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this context, maybe it's about genes influencing each other's expression?
Wait, no, pleiotropy is more about one gene affecting multiple phenotypes. Hmm, but in genetic interactions, maybe it refers to genes affecting each other in a pathway.

- Epistasis: When the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes.' So, an epistatic gene's phenotype masks or modifies the phenotype of another gene. For example, if gene B is epistatic over gene A, then the presence of a certain allele in B determines whether A's effects are visible.

- Gene redundancy: When two genes have overlapping or duplicate functions. So, if one is knocked out, the other can compensate. If both are knocked out, the effect is more severe.

The setup says that at least one of G1, G2, G3 is a transcription factor acting upstream of another gene. So, the transcription factor (TF) is probably activating other genes involved in resistance.

Looking at the data:

Control (wild type) has 100% resistance.

Mutants:
- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)

Double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm. So, let's process this. 

First, the single mutants: g2 is completely susceptible, which is 0% resistance. That's a big effect. G2's knockout makes the plant very vulnerable. G1's knockout reduces resistance to 75%, so it's not as severe. G3's knockout is halfway; 50% resistance.

When considering double mutants, the g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants both show 0% resistance. So, in both cases, the presence of the second mutation in g2 doesn't change the outcome—they're as susceptible as g2 alone. That suggests that g2 is the one that's epistatic here. Because when you have g2 knocked out, even if another gene is also knocked out, the resistance is as bad as g2 alone. So, maybe g2 is epistatic over the others.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance drops to 10%, which is worse than either of their single mutants (75% and 50%). So, knocking out both g1 and g3 together makes things much worse. That might suggest some redundancy or additive effect.

But wait, let's think about what each gene's role might be. Since g2 knockout is the most severe (0%), it's likely that G2 is the transcription factor. Because if G2 is a TF, then its knockout would prevent the expression of downstream genes it regulates. So, any downstream genes (like G1 or G3) would not be expressed. But wait, in the data, g1 and g3 single mutants are not 0%, so that might not fit.

Wait, another angle: if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then knocking G2 out would affect both G1 and G3 expression. But in the data, when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%, which is much worse than either G1 or G3 single mutants. So perhaps G2 is the TF, and without it, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't function. But in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, which implies they still have some function—perhaps they're regulated by other factors as well, or G2 isn't the only regulator.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then in the absence of G2, G1 and G3
