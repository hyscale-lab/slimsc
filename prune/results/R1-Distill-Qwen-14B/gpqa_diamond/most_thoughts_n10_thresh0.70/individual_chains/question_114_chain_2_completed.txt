Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. There are two reactions given, and I need to choose the correct options A and B based on the steps.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably some kind of nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are good nucleophiles. So maybe it's an addition reaction?

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would lead to a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe? Because I think the addition of HCN to ketones typically uses an acid. So, the reaction is probably the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Cyanohydrin formation involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen attacks the CN- nucleophile, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate, and then protonation occurs. So, the reagent A is probably an acid that protonates the intermediate to drive the reaction forward.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw its structure. The molecule has a nitrile group (CN) attached to the second carbon, which also has a hydroxyl (OH) and a methyl group (CH(CH3)OH-C-CN? Wait, more accurately, it's (CH(CH3))CH(OH)CN? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When CN- adds, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the product is indeed a cyanohydrin.

So the reagent A would be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (since H3O+ is a common acid catalyst in such reactions), or perhaps something else like H2SO4. But looking at the options, the choices for A are H3O+, NaHSO3, etc.

Wait, but sometimes when dealing with more sensitive situations, like if the carbonyl is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group or if the reaction is under specific conditions, other acids might be used. But NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a mild acid. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: if the carbonyl is a ketone, the addition of HCN (with a catalyst like H3O+) would form the cyanohydrin. So reagent A is H3O+.

Then, looking at the options, for reaction A, the possible reagents are H3O+ or NaHSO3. So options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Reacting this with reagent B (which is H2O?) gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the structure of the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile substituted with a 4-benzylphenyl group. So the molecule is something like:
Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CN? Or perhaps more accurately, the substituents are on the second carbon of butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe not, but I think the key is that the nitrile group is adjacent to a hydroxyl group.

The product is the corresponding acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

How does that happen? Oh, right! The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically involves strong acidic conditions, like HCl or H2SO4, and heat. Another possibility is using a strong base, but I think in this case, considering the presence of a hydroxyl group, it's more likely acid-catalyzed.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides first, and then further to acids. But in this case, it's a direct conversion. So the reaction is probably the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent. So when you hydrolyse the nitrile, you don't want the hydroxyl group to interfere. Or maybe it's part of the structure.

Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, meaning the nitrile is on the second carbon, which has a hydroxyl as well. So when you hydrolyse the nitrile, you would get a carboxylic acid on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group.

So reaction-wise, hydrolysis of nitrile to acid. The typical reagents for this are H2O under acidic conditions, such as H2SO4 or HCl. Alternatively, using H3O+ as a catalyst in aqueous conditions.

Looking at the options, reagent B is H2O, but the options give possible B as HCl or CH3COOH.

So, for the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O, but the catalyst or acid is needed. So perhaps the reagent is HCl. Because I think that nitrile hydrolysis to acid usually uses a strong acid, like HCl, with heat, and water.

Wait, let's think about the mechanism. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically occurs under strongly acidic conditions. So when the nitrile is treated with concentrated HCl and water, it forms the chloro-derivative first (maybe), but more accurately, the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis in HCl to form a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, another way: nitriles can be hydrolyzed using a strong acid (like HCl) and water, often under reflux conditions.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. Because the options are for B as HCl or CH3COOH.

Looking back at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C has B as HCl. Let me see.

So, for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+, and for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option C is A = NaHSO3, B= HCl.

Wait, but if the second reaction uses HCl as the reagent, then the first reaction, using H3O+ as A, makes sense.

But wait, what about the second reaction conditions? Let me make sure.

The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When treating with H2O and reagent B, which is HCl, I think it's the acid in the aqueous solution that helps the hydrolysis.

So the reagents would be: for reaction 1, H3O+ (acid catalyst) and NaCN; for reaction 2, HCl (as B) plus water.

Wait, but in the question, the second reaction is written as:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the reagent B is in parentheses as H2O, but the options have B as HCl or others. So perhaps the reagent B is HCl, and H2O is the reaction medium.

So putting it together, first reaction uses H3O+ as A, second uses HCl as B.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → this matches.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → but in reaction 1, if A was NaHSO3, that's a different scenario. But why would NaHSO3 be used? That's a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, another thought: in the first reaction, when you add NaCN to a ketone, do you need H3O+ as a catalyst? Or does NaCN provide the necessary CN- and maybe the reaction is done in basic conditions?

Wait, no. Because in the formation of cyanohydrin, the addition requires acid catalysis. The mechanism is: the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making it a better electrophile. Then, the CN- attacks, leading to the tetrahedral intermediate. Then, another proton is added to push the elimination of water, forming the cyanohydrin.

So, the acid is necessary. So for reaction 1, A must be an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+ or CH3COOH (which is a weak acid). NaHSO3 is a weak acid as well, but in solution, it can provide H+ ions.

Wait, but in the presence of NaCN, which is a salt, perhaps the solution is slightly basic. So adding H3O+ would make it more acidic, which is necessary.

So for reaction 1, the reagent A is H3O+.

So, reaction 1: ketone + NaCN + H3O+ → cyanohydrin.

Reaction 2: 2-hydroxybutanenitrile + H2O and HCl → 2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, looking at the options, the correct pair is A = H3O+ (option A or B) and B=HCl (option A or C).

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that's the correct combination.

But wait, looking again at the options.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

So why would someone choose NaHSO3 for A? I'm a bit confused. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a mild reducing agent and can act as an acid. But in the first reaction, the addition of HCN to a ketone requires an acidic condition. So H3O+ would be more appropriate, as it's a strong acid.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is done under basic conditions with NaCN, but I don't think so because the mechanism requires acid. So I think option A is correct.


The problem involves selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, confirms that the reaction proceeds via acid-catalyzed cyanohydrin formation. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** is the most appropriate acid catalyst for this reaction.

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl, to facilitate the reaction. While H₂O is the reaction medium, the reagent B must be HCl to drive the reaction forward.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, and HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH (a weak acid) is not strong enough for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction.  

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ is a mild acid and not strong enough for the cyanohydrin formation in the first reaction.  

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Both NaHSO₃ and CH₃COOH are insufficient for their respective reactions.  

### Conclusion:
The correct choice is **Option A**, as it provides the appropriate reagents for both reactions.  

**Answer: A**
