Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and from it, you can derive quantities like area or volume. 

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. Oh right, I think this is similar to the metric of a 2-dimensional pseudosphere, which is a type of space with negative curvature. Pseudospheres are maximally symmetric and have a constant negative curvature, right?

So the question is about the area. I remember that for a sphere in 3D, the area is 4πr². But wait, this is a pseudosphere, which is a 2-dimensional surface. Wait, no, wait. No, the metric is 2-dimensional, so it's a 2D surface. So I'm looking for its area, maybe the total area?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think. In 2D, if it's a sphere, the area would be 4πr², but that's in 3D. But for a 2D surface embedded in 3D, like the sphere, the area is 4πr² as well. But for a pseudosphere, which is a 2D surface (with Lorentzian metric?), the area might be something else.

Wait, wait. Let me get back to the metric. The given metric is:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x
