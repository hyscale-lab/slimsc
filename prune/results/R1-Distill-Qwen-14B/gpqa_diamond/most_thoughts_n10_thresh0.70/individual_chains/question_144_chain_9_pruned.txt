Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says X is a meson resonance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. They want the mean decay distance.

Wait, I remember that the decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula is something like decay distance L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to light speed.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the energy width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, so let me get the units right. Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert that to GeV or something that matches the other units. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ is the reduced Planck constant. What's the value? I think ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me double-check that. Oh yeah, because ħ is about 197 MeV·fm or something, but when working in GeV units, it's 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ is about 20.56875e-25 seconds, or 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, I need to find the velocity β. How? Well, I can use the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. The total energy E is gamma * m c², and the momentum p is gamma * m v, where v is the velocity. Alternatively, for a relativistic particle, maybe we can find beta
