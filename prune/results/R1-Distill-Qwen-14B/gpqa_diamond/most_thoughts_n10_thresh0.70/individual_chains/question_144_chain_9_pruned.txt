Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of the meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle, its speed, and the time it lives before decaying. Oh right, the formula should be something like distance = gamma * beta * c * tau, where tau is the mean lifetime.

Wait, but wait, mean lifetime tau is related to the decay width Γ. I think the relation is tau = ħ / Γ, but wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Oh yes, the mean lifetime (proper time) is tau = ħ / Γ. No, wait, no, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau is ħ divided by Gamma. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Then, to get the mean decay distance, I need to multiply tau by the velocity of the particle times the speed of light. So distance = v * tau * c. Wait no, because v is in terms of the speed of light. Let me think again. The formula is (gamma * beta) * c * tau. Because beta is v/c, so beta * c is v. And gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So first, I need to calculate gamma for the particle. Gamma is E/(m c^2). But wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2. Let me compute that. 8 divided by 1.2 is approximately 6.666... or 20/3.

Wait, but wait, E here is the total energy, which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So yes, gamma is E/(m c^2) but since E is already in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps the units will work out if we handle it properly.

Wait, perhaps I should write the energy in terms of m. E = gamma * m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², let's see. Let me think about units. Let's just compute gamma as E / m. Because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But when E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², we can write:

gamma = (E [GeV]) / (m [GeV/c²] * c²) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me see an example. If E = 8 GeV and m =
