Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several steps to produce a final product, which is one of the four given options. I need to determine which option is correct.

Let me break down each step and think about what reactions occur. I'll try to visualize each transformation.

First step: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1. I remember that nitration of benzene typically uses a mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 as the catalyst. Nitration adds a nitro group, which is a strong meta-directing group. So product 1 should be nitrobenzene. Wait, but wait, benzene can undergo nitration either in the meta or para positions? No, nitration is a meta director, so the nitro group would be added in the meta position. Wait no, no, wait, nitration adds a nitro group as a meta director. So benzene â†’ nitrobenzene.

Wait, correction: Actually, nitration of benzene adds a nitro group in the meta position relative to any existing substituents. But since benzene is just benzene, the first substitution will place the nitro group in the para position? Wait, no, wait. No, when
