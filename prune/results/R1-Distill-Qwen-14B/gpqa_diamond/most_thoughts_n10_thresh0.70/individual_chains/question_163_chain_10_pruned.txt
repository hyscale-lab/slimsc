Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with an acid, it's a neutralization reaction. So Fe(OH)3 should react with a strong acid like HCl, right?

The problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. First, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 that is. The formula weight for Fe(OH)3 would be Fe's atomic weight plus 3 times the OH group's weight. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, and OH is 17.01 g/mol each. So that's 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.1 divided by approximately 106.88 is around 0.000936 moles. Or wait, wait, 0.1 / 106.88 is 0.0009357 moles, maybe. Let me double-check that calculation. 106.88 times 0.0009357 is roughly 0.1, yeah.

Now, the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid like HCl. The balanced equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of HCl. So moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which means moles per liter. So the volume needed is moles / concentration. 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Wait, but the problem says 'minimum volume' to dissolve it. Hmm, okay, that makes sense because it's the stoichiometric amount required. So the first part of the answer is around 28.07 cm³.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which must be the correct volume. So that's the first part.

Now for the pH. After the reaction, the solution is FeCl3 in water. FeCl3 is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So the solution will be acidic because the Fe^3+ ion hydrolyzes in water.

So the pH depends on the concentration of Fe^3+ ions. Let's calculate the concentration. The total volume is 100 cm³ plus the volume of acid added. Wait, wait, no. The problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume would be 100 cm³ plus the volume of acid added. Hmm, but wait, the question says "in 100 cm³ total volume." So the initial volume is 100 cm³, and we're adding the acid to that. So the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³ + volume of acid. But wait, no, because 100 cm³ is the total solution. So if I add x cm³
