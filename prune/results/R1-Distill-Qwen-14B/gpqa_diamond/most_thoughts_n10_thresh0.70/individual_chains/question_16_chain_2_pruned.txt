Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me remember what optical activity means. Oh right, a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Or sometimes, if there's a plane of symmetry or something that makes it non-chiral.

Wait, but wait. There are other factors too. For example, meso compounds aren't optically active because they have an internal plane of symmetry, even though they have chiral centers. So I need to be careful about that.

The question lists seven compounds. I'll go through each one by one and determine if they're optically active.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Let me draw this structure. The molecule is but-1-ene, so CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So structure is Cl-C double bond C-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Oh, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH3)Cl? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. 2-methyl would be a methyl branch on the second carbon. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as CHCl=CHCH(CH3)2? Hmm, not sure, but maybe the structure isn't the key point here. Wait, but the configuration is (Z). So for a double bond, Z configuration refers to the arrangement of substituents on each carbon. But does this compound have a chiral center?

Wait, let me think about the molecule. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the first carbon is connected to Cl, double-bonded to the second carbon, which has a methyl group. So
