Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. A chemist found a white solid, and some spectral data is given. I need to identify which of the four options it is based on the mass spec, IR, and NMR data.

First, let me look at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm. So the molecular weight is likely 156. The other peak is 158, which is two mass units higher. Maybe it's a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has isotopes at around 35 and 37 Cl, so that would add 2 mass units. So the molecular formula probably has a chlorine atom.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H and strong carbonyl peaks. Also, maybe esters or other carbonyl compounds. Let me think about what the options are.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

So benzoic acid derivatives. Let me think about the NMR. The 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

The peak at 11.0 ppm is a singlet. That's probably a carboxylic acid proton, since they are usually around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. Wait, but wait. In the given data, it's a singlet, but carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, not sharp. Hmm, or maybe this is an aldehyde proton? Wait, options A has a benzaldehyde group. The aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. So that's a possibility.

Wait, but looking at the other peaks. The other NMR peaks are at 8.02 and 7.72, both doublets with 2H each. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. So maybe it's para-substituted aromatic rings. Because in para substitution, each pair of protons would be a doublet, each being next to one substituent. Alternatively, if it's an ortho substitution, maybe the splitting is more complex.

Let me think about each option:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to the para position, and COOH at the ortho. Wait, no, benzoic acid is at the para position. Wait, 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have the Cl at the para position relative to the COOH group. So the structure is benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. So the ring would have two substituents, each in para positions.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let's see, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has two substituents: COOH and Cl. The remaining protons are in the ortho and meta positions relative to each substituent. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the ring is substituted with COOH at position 1. So the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the two remaining positions are 2 and 3, and 5 and 6. Wait, no. Let me imagine the ring:

Positions are 1 (COOH), 4 (Cl). Then positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are meta. So the protons would be in positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5. But since the substituents are at 1 and 4, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (if the ring is symmetrical) and similar chemical shifts. Similarly, 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the splitting would depend on the neighboring substituents.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two doublets each have 2H. So that suggests that each doublet corresponds to a pair of equivalent protons. For example, in para-substituted benzene, like para-substituted with two groups, the protons would be as two doublets.

Alternatively, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, then perhaps the protons are at positions 3,4,5,6, but then the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, going back to the NMR. The aromatic region has two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So four aromatic protons in total. So the molecule must have four aromatic protons. So the substituents must be in positions that make the remaining four protons into two sets of equivalent pairs.

If the molecule is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the ring has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Each of these positions has a hydrogen. Wait, but in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, and Cl at 4. So the ring would have two substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para to each other). So the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. Each of these positions has a hydrogen, but due to symmetry, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent.

So the H at 2 and 6 would be next to the COOH group (position 1), and the H at 3 and 5 would be next to the Cl (position 4). So the H's at 2 and 6 would be deshielded more because of the electron-withdrawing COOH group. The H's at 3 and 5 are near Cl, which is slightly de-shielding as well.

So in the NMR, the H's at 2 and 6 would be more downfield than those at 3 and 5. So for the NMR data, we have two doublets. The more downfield one (8.02 ppm) would be the two H's (each doublet of 2H) near the COOH group, and the other doublet (7.72) would be the two H's near the Cl.

Wait, but in the NMR, the first doublet is
