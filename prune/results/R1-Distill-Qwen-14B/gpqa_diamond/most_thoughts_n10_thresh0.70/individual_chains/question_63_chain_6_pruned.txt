Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I need to find the momentum of a photon that causes a molecule to switch states. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. The given masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it and transitions to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. Hmm, I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (J=0) maybe? Or does each model have different starting points? Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, the states are quantized in both rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0.

But wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the next higher energy state. I think that in this model, the energy levels are quantized, so the transition would involve both a change in vibrational and rotational energy.

Wait, but the question is about the photon's momentum, so I probably need to calculate the energy difference between the two states and then find the momentum from the energy using E=pc (since for a photon, energy is related to momentum as E = p c, where c is the speed of light).

Wait, no. For a photon, the relation is E = h f = pc. So p = E / c. So I need to find the energy difference between the initial and final states, and that will give me the photon's energy, from which I can find the momentum.

But what's the initial and final state? The molecule is in the fundamental state. The next state with the lowest possible energyâ€”so the next state would be the first excited state. But what's the energy structure here? Are we considering only vibration, or also rotation?

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which one is lower in energy?

Wait, I
