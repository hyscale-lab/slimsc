Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that when a molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to a higher energy state. The question here is about finding the momentum of the photon needed for this transition.

Let me read the problem again. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the absorbed photon that switches it to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of X and Y (20 amu and 2 amu), the bond length R (2 angstroms), and the angular frequency w (4e14 rad/s).

Wait, so the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? And the next state would be the next higher energy level. But since it's a diatomic molecule, I think the energy levels come from both rotation and vibration. Oh wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is a non-rigid rotor model. So, that probably means it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed. Oh, but wait, maybe that's a different point. The question is about the energy transition when a photon is absorbed. So I need to figure out the energy difference between the current state and the next state, then relate that to the photon's energy, and from there, find the momentum.

But wait, the problem is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in the ground state, and the photon causes it to transition to the next
