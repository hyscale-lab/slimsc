Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. We're given the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. And the options are four possible eigenvectors.

Hmm. I remember that for spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. So the operator here is probably the spin operator. The eigenvectors correspond to spin-up or spin-down along a particular direction.

The operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is in the x-z plane, meaning the angle theta is measured from the z-axis, and phi would be zero since it's in the x-z plane. Wait, but the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so phi is 0, but theta varies.

Wait, the operator P along an arbitrary direction n would be the sum of the components in that direction. So the operator P would be proportional to n · σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. But wait, the given components are P_x, P_y, P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each multiplied by ħ/2 gives the components of the spin operator.

So the operator P for a direction n would be given by n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component (n_y) is zero. So the operator simplifies to P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, no, wait. The direction vector n is a unit vector. Let me think. The direction is given by a unit vector n = (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane. So n_x² + n_z² =1.

So the operator P is the spin operator along n. So the operator is P = (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z). Each P component is (ħ/2) times their respective 2x2 matrices.

Wait, no
