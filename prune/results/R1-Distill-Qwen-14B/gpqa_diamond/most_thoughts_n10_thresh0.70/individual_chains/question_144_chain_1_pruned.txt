Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question says that X is a meson resonance, and I need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various numbers in meters, so I think I need to calculate the decay length using these parameters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find τ? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ ≈ ħ/τ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. Let me think about the units.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Planck's constant ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ would be ħ divided by Γ, so τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds. That's the lifetime.

Next, I need to find the velocity β. Since the particle is a meson, which is a boson, but regardless, for relativistic particles, β is close to 1. But perhaps I can calculate it more accurately. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much larger than the mass, so it's definitely ultrarelativistic. But let's compute it properly.

The energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. So γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but the units here are in GeV, so it's easier. Let's convert everything into units where c=1. Then E = 8 Ge
