Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The IR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR has several signals, but none are vinyl hydrogens, and there are some complex splitting patterns. The options are four different structures, all of which are some sort of substituted carboxylic acids.

First, I'll start by analyzing the IR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably due to O-H stretching. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because the -OH group is both acidic and can form hydrogen bonds. So that makes sense. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, which fits with the carboxylic acid as well because the carbonyl (C=O) in carboxylic acids typically absorbs around there, maybe a bit higher than 1700 but close.

Now looking at the NMR. The key point here is that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds, or if there are, the protons adjacent aren't showing up. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see any with double bonds. They all seem to have branching but not any alkenes. So that's probably not an issue. 

The NMR has several signals, which suggests multiple different types of protons. Let's look at the splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about how splitting works.

Each coupling (each neighboring set of protons) causes the splitting. So let's break down the first splitting: doublet of triplets of quartets. That would mean the proton is coupling with three different sets of neighboring protons. Each coupling would multiply the number of peaks. So a doublet (from two neighbors), then each of those splits into triplets (another set of two?), and then each triplet splits into quartets (a set of three neighbors? Or maybe four? Wait, quartet comes from three neighboring protons. Like a CH2 group with three Hs? No, a quartet is four peaks, which comes from coupling with three neighboring hydrogens. So the splitting must involve three different coupling constants. 

Alternatively, perhaps each splitting is from a different group. Let me think about this structure. Since the options are all carboxylic acids with branching, let's imagine their structures.

Looking at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, so this would be something like (CH2CH3)2CCH2COOH. Let me write it as:

The main chain is CH2CH2COOH, but the middle has two substituents, each being C2H5. Wait, actually, the structure would be:

The central carbon is connected to two CH2CH3 groups, a CH2 group which is connected to the COOH, and a central CH. So maybe it's (CH2CH3)C(CH2CH3)(CH2COOH)CH3? No, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many equivalent protons each group has.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH-(C2H5) - CH-(C2H5) - COOH. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substituted structure. Let me think: the molecule is something like (CH2CH3)2C-CH2-COOH? Or maybe not
