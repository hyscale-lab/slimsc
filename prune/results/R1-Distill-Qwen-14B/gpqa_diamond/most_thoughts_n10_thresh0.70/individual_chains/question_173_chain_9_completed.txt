Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum, and that it's given by Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Right, and since they're asking for the minimum uncertainty, I guess I should use the equality, so Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

The question says the electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v = 2e8 m/s, but wait, actually, the problem says to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. Oh, right, because energy is related to momentum. So I think I need to connect the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, the electron's speed is given, but the problem is about uncertainty. Maybe I don't need the exact velocity but the uncertainty in momentum. Or perhaps I should find the momentum from the velocity and then find the Δp from Δx. Let me think.

So, uncertainty in position Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters, or 1e-10 meters. Right.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So half of that is about 5.27e-35 J·s. So Δx * Δp = ħ/2. So solving for Δp: Δp = (ħ/2) / Δx.

Let me compute that. Δx is 1e-10 m, so Δp = (1.0545718e-34 / 2) / 1e-10. Wait, 1e-34 / 1e-10 is 1e-24. So 1.05e-34 / 2 is about 5.27e-35. Divided by 1e-10 is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, but wait, 1e-34 divided by 2 is 0.5e-34, which is 5e-35. So 5e-35 / 1e-10 is 5e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, how does this relate to energy? The energy of a particle is given by E = p²/(2m), where m is mass. Since we're dealing with uncertainty, I think the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in momentum squared over twice the mass. So ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m) ?

Wait, let me think. For small uncertainties, the uncertainty in energy can be approximated as ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), because E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. The derivative dE/dp is p/m, but when taking the uncertainty, I think it's more like (Δp * p)/(m), but since p is the average, maybe in the uncertainty, it's just (Δp)^2/(2m) since the expansion of (p + Δp)^2 would be p² + 2pΔp + (Δp)^2, so the average E is p²/(2m), and the uncertainty is (Δp)^2/(2m) plus some terms, but perhaps the main term is (Δp)^2/(2m). Or maybe I should think in terms of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, but that might not be necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to use the relation between momentum and energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m). So yes, that's the right approach.

So plugging in the numbers: (5.27e-25)^2 / (2 * m_e), where m_e is the mass of the electron, which is about 9.109e-31 kg.

Let me compute that. (5.27e-25)^2 = (5.27)^2 = approx 27.77, so 27.77e-50 = 2.777e-49.

Divide that by 2 * 9.109e-31 kg: denominator is 1.8218e-30.

So 2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = approximately 1.524e-19 J. Hmm, but wait, that's 1.5e-19. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, option B is ~1e-17. So perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Let me recompute Δp.

Wait, Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m. So:

Δp = (ħ/2) / Δx = (1.05457e-34 / 2) / 1e-10 = (5.27285e-35) / 1e-10 = 5.27285e-25 kg·m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, (Δp)^2 = (5.27285e-25)^2 = 5.27e-25 squared. 5.27^2 is about 27.77, and (e-25)^2 is e-50, so 27.77e-50 = 2.777e-49 kg²·m²/s².

Divide by 2m: 2 * 9.109e-31 kg = 1.8218e-30 kg.

So 2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = let's compute that.

2.777 / 1.8218 ≈ 1.524.

Exponents: 1e-49 / 1e-30 = 1e-19.

So 1.524e-19 J. So about 1.5e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m). Maybe I should think about the uncertainty in energy in terms of the momentum uncertainty and the derivative. Let me think, the energy is E = p²/(2m), so ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp = (p/m) * Δp. But wait, p is the average momentum, which for the electron here is much larger than the uncertainty. Because the electron's momentum is p = mv = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s. The Δp is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So p is about 3.47e3 times larger than Δp. So when you take p/m, that's (1.82e-22)/(9.1e-31) ) = approx 2e8. Then ΔE ≈ (2e8) * (5.27e-25) = 1.054e-16 J. Wait, that gives a much larger value. Hmm, but this approach is conflicting with the previous result.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me get this straight. The two approaches are:

1. Using ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), which gave me about 1.5e-19 J.

2. Using ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp, which gives about 1e-16 J.

Which one is correct?

Wait, I think the correct approach is to use the first method. Because the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p times the uncertainty in p. The derivative dE/dp is p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Ah, right, so that's the correct way. Because the uncertainty in E is the sensitivity of E to changes in p multiplied by the uncertainty in p.

Wait, but wait, in the first approach I treated it as ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m) which is correct when p is the average value, and the uncertainty is small. But if you're using the derivative approach, you get ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp, which is (p * Δp)/m.

Wait, but which method is correct?

Let me think again. The relationship between E and p is E = p²/(2m). The uncertainty in E, ΔE, can be found using error propagation. The formula for the uncertainty in a function when the function depends on a single variable is ΔE = |dE/dp| * Δp.

So dE/dp is (2p)/(2m) ) = p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

So that would give a much larger value.

Wait, the p here is the average momentum, which is (mv) = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s.

So p is 1.82e-22 kg·m/s. m is 9.1e-31 kg.

So p/m is (1.82e-22)/(9.1e-31) ) ≈ 2e8 (since 1.82/9.1 is about 0.2, and 1e-22/1e-31 is 1e9. So 0.2 * 1e9 = 2e8.)

So (p/m) is 2e8 s/m.

Then Δp is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

So ΔE ≈ (2e8) * (5.27e-25) = 1.054e-16 J.

Hmm, that's 1.05e-16 J, which is about 1e-16 J. So that's option D.

Wait, but earlier using the other method, I got 1.5e-19 J, which is about 1e-19, which would be option C. So which approach is correct?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's compute the uncertainty in energy using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle between time and energy. But wait, the question gives position uncertainty, so I think the initial approach using position and momentum is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy uncertainty via the momentum uncertainty, which is connected via the momentum-energy uncertainty relation. Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle also states that ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But without knowing the time uncertainty, that might not help directly.

Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that the uncertainty in energy is related to the kinetic energy change based on the momentum uncertainty. So the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in kinetic energy would be (Δp)^2/(2m) if the momentum is measured precisely. But wait, that's the same as the first approach I took, giving 1.5e-19 J.

Wait, but I'm now getting conflicting results because of two different methods. I need to figure out which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second method. Let me reevaluate the two approaches.

Method 1: ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m) → 1.5e-19 J.

Method 2: ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp → 1.05e-16 J.

Which is correct?

I think the correct approach is the second one because when you have a function that depends on p and you're taking the uncertainty, you use the derivative. So for E = p^2/(2m), dE/dp = p/m, so ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but in that case, the uncertainty in E is proportional to p, which is a large number. So even though Δp is small, when you multiply by p/m, which is large, you get a relatively larger ΔE.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let's reevaluate.

Wait, the error propagation formula for E = f(p) = p²/(2m) is:

ΔE = |dE/dp| * Δp.

So dE/dp is (2p)/(2m) ) = p/m.

So ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

So yes, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

p = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s.

m = 9.1e-31 kg.

So p/m = 1.82e-22 / 9.1e-31 ≈ 2e8 s/m.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

So ΔE = (2e8) * (5.27e-25) = 1.054e-16 J.

Which is about 1e-16 J. So the answer would be option D.

But wait, another way to think about this: the kinetic energy is (p^2)/(2m), so the relative uncertainty in p is Δp/p. So the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately 2*(Δp/p), because E is proportional to p squared. So the absolute uncertainty ΔE = E * (2Δp/p).

So E is (p^2)/(2m) = (1.82e-22)^2 / (2 *9.1e-31).

Calculating E: (1.82e-22)^2 = (3.31e-44) / (1.82e-30) → 3.31e-44 / 1.82e-30 = approx 1.82e-14 J.

Then, the relative uncertainty is 2*(Δp/p) = 2*(5.27e-25 / 1.82e-22) = 2*(2.9e-3) ≈ 5.8e-3.

So ΔE ≈ E * 5.8e-3 → 1.82e-14 * 0.0058 ≈ 1.05e-16 J. Which matches the previous result.

So this approach also gives 1.05e-16 J, so option D.

Wait, but earlier when I used the first approach without considering p, I got a much smaller value. So that approach must have been incorrect.

So perhaps I should have used the derivative method in the first place.

Wait, but why did I get such a different answer when I used the two methods? Oh, because the first method, (Δp)^2/(2m), is correct only when p is zero? No, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, no.

Wait, wait a minute. Let's think again. The correct approach is using the error propagation formula, which for E = p²/(2m) gives ΔE = (p/m)*Δp.

So why did the first approach give a different result? Because in that approach, I assumed that E is (Δp)^2/(2m), which is only valid when the average p is zero, which it isn't in this case.

So the correct approach is the second one, giving 1e-16 J. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but wait, the initial approach using the uncertainty principle for position and momentum gave me a Δp, and using that to find the energy uncertainty gave a 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But looking at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J, which is what I got.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up a calculation step. Let me recheck the calculation of (p/m) * Δp.

p = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s.

m = 9.1e-31 kg.

p/m = (1.82e-22) / (9.1e-31) = let's compute this.

1.82 /9.1 ≈ 0.2. Then 1e-22 / 1e-31 = 1e9. So 0.2 * 1e9 = 2e8.

So p/m is 2e8 s/m.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

So 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = 1.054e-16 J. Yep.

So the correct answer is D, ~1e-16 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum. The uncertainty principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \) and \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Solving for \( \Delta p \), we find:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \cdot 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the electron is given by \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), where \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated using error propagation:

\[
\Delta E \approx \left| \frac{dE}{dp} \right| \cdot \Delta p.
\]

Since \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dE}{dp} = \frac{p}{m}.
\]

Thus, the uncertainty in energy becomes:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{p}{m} \cdot \Delta p.
\]

The momentum \( p \) of the electron is calculated as:

\[
p = m \cdot v = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 2 \times 10^8 = 1.82 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Substituting the values, we find:

\[
\frac{p}{m} = \frac{1.82 \times 10^{-22}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}} \approx 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{s/m}.
\]

Now, substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E \approx (2 \times 10^8) \cdot (5.27 \times 10^{-25}) = 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

This value is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
