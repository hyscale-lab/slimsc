Okay, so I've got this question about observations in the Milky Way related to absorption lines. Hmm, let me think through what I know.

The question says that structures are being observed at about 2.1 gigaparsecs away. Wait, but that's not the main point. The key here is the absorption line energy equivalent, which is 3.9 micro electron volts. Oh right, I remember that different parts of the interstellar medium (ISM) emit or absorb certain energies.

Absorption lines are usually from specific transitions in atoms or molecules. The energy of these lines depends on the temperature and density of the medium. So, if the energy is 3.9e-6 eV, that's a really small number. Wait, micro is 1e-6, so 3.9 micro eV is 3.9e-6 eV.

I think about the different components of the ISM. There's the hot, warm, and cold phases. The cold ISM is mostly molecular and has lower temperatures, like around 10 K. The warm is atomic or molecular but higher than cold, maybe 100-1000 K. And the hot is millions of Kelvin, but that's more in the ionized gas.

Wait, but the energy of the absorption line is related to the ionization potential or the transition energy. For example, Lyman-alpha is about 10.2 eV, which is way higher. So a micro electronvolt is quite low. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the 21 cm line is from hydrogen atoms in the hyperfine transition. That's about 2
