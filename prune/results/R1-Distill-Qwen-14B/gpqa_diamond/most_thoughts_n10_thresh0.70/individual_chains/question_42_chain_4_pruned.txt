Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. I think that method relies on the gravitational influence of other planets on a star's reflex motion, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are about 1.4. So, T1/T2 ≈ 1.4? Or wait, maybe T2/T1 is 1.4? Hmm, the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. I'm a bit confused by the wording. Oh right, when they say the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between A and B is X, it's either T_A/T_B or T_B/T_A. I think in this context, it's probably T_planet1 / T_planet2 = 1.4. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Because generally, if a planet is farther from the star, it would be colder. So if Planet1 is hotter, it might be closer.

Wait, equilibrium temperature is given by the formula T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( M_planet )^(1/4) / (a (1 - albedo))^(1/4) )? No, wait, the equilibrium temperature is usually derived from the star's luminosity, the planet's albedo, and the distance a. So the formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ), assuming a circular orbit and uniform albedo. Or wait, the standard formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (2(1 - e)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 + m_planet/M_star) )^(1/4) ) * ( L * (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) / (16 π a^2 σ )^(1/4) ) Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.

The equilibrium temperature formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) / ( (1 + (M_planet/M_star))^(1/4) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward: T ∝ (L/(a^2(1 - A)))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's orbital radius, and A is albedo. Wait, but the star's luminosity is the same for all planets, right? Because all planets are orbiting the same star.

Wait, so the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) )

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, a more precise formula is:

T_eq = ( ( L * (1 - A) ) / (16 π a^2 σ) ) )^(1/4)

Yes, that sounds right. L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, a is the orbital radius, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, since L, A, and σ are the same for all three planets, the equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), because (1/a^2) under the 1/4 power becomes (1/a)^(1/2).

Wait, let me compute that.
