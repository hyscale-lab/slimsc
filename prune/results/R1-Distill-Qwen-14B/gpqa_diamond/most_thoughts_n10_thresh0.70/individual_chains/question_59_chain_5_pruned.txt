Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't have a lot of experience with these kinds of questions. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, right, when you mix acids and bases, you're probably looking at a neutralization reaction. So first, I should figure out how much acid and how much base are present, and then see if there's excess of either.

Wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when these are all mixed together, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. The excess H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So I think the approach here is to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess. Then, the concentration of the excess ion in the total solution volume will let me find the pH.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

First, for CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, but when calculating H+ contributions, I think I should treat it as a source of H+ but maybe not as straightforward as a strong acid. Wait, but when you mix everything, the strong acid and strong base will react first. So maybe I should first neutralize the HCl and Ba(OH)2, and then see what's left. Then, the acetic acid might react if there's any OH- left, but perhaps in this case, it's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 will react with the HCl and any remaining OH- will then react with the acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out all the H+ and OH- contributions.

Let me think: HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, contributing H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. But wait, how much OH- does Ba(OH)2 produce? Each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. Because the formula is Ba(OH)2, it's Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

So, let's compute the moles:

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L =
