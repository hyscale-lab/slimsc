Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids. Since the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a hyperbolic space, maybe this metric is representing a hyperbolic plane.

So the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere radius... I'm a little confused. Oh right, in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is an example of a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric they provided might be related to that.

But wait, the metric here seems to be in two dimensions, right? Because it's dx² + dy². So this is a 2D metric. That makes sense because a pseudosphere is a 2D surface.

The general form of the metric for a pseudosphere (which is a hyperbolic plane) is something like ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ², but I'm not sure if that's the exact form. Alternatively, maybe it's written in isothermal coordinates or something else.

Wait, another approach. The metric given is conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So
