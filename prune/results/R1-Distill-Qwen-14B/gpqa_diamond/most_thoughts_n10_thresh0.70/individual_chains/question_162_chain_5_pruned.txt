Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element for some kind of curved space. I remember that in relativity, the metric tells us about the geometry of spacetime, but here it's just a 2-dimensional metric, probably representing a surface.

The question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I think the term is sometimes used in different contexts, but in metric terms, it's similar to hyperbolic space. The area of a sphere in 3D is 4πr², but for a pseudosphere (which is a 2D surface), I might be thinking about something like the hyperbolic plane's area, but wait, hyperbolic plane is infinite in extent, so its area would be infinite. But wait, maybe in this case, the pseudosphere is a finite area.

Wait, pseudosphere as a surface of revolution, like the tractricoid, which is a finite area with infinite perimeter. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the area of a sphere embedded in a space with this metric. Let's think about what this metric represents.

Looking at the metric: ds² = [32/(
