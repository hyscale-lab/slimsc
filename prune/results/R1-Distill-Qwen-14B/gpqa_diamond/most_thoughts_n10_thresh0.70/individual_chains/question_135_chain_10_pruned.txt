Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a boson X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think the notation here might be a bit off. Usually, the interaction term would involve the field of the boson, so perhaps it's something like X(y) ψ_f(y) ψ_f(y)? Oh wait, maybe the correct form is something like X(y) ψ̄_f ψ_f, which would represent the Yukawa interaction. Because in Yukawa theory, you have terms like g φ ψ̄ ψ, where φ is the scalar field. So in this case, X is the scalar field, and ψ_f is the fermion field.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermions can be produced when X decays.

At lowest order, the decay would be through tree-level Feynman diagrams. The interaction term would allow X to couple directly to fermions. So, X can decay into a pair of fermions. But which fermions are possible?

Fermions come in different types, like quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau), and their antiparticles. But not all of them will be allowed because the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion (since energy and momentum must allow for the decay product to have rest mass).

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the masses of the fermions. Oh wait, I think I remember that in the Standard Model, each generation of fermions has certain masses. For example, the top quark is the heaviest, with a mass around 173 GeV, which is way higher than X's 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks because 2*m_t is about 346 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So any decay channel involving top quarks is out.

What about other quarks? Let's see: up, down, strange, charm, bottom. Wait, but what are their masses? I think up, down, strange are much lighter. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.7 GeV. Let me check: the masses (approximate) are:

- Up: about 2 MeV (so negligible)
- Down: around 4-5 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV

So for X (6 GeV) to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion's mass must satisfy 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ 3 Ge
