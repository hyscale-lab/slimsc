Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions is given by a Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ_f fψ_f(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, I think I've seen similar Lagrangians before. It looks like it's describing how the boson X interacts with fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, so X is a boson, probably a scalar since the Lagrangian is written that way. So when it decays, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because bosons can annihilate into pairs of fermions.

But wait, the problem is about allowed decays, so we need to consider the possible fermions that X can decay into, considering their mass and the mass of X.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So any fermions it can decay into must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be possible, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the parent particle.

Wait, but wait: the decay products are fermions, like quarks or leptons. Each fermion has a rest mass. So for a fermion-antifermion pair, the total rest mass is twice the mass of the fermion.

So, the mass of X (6 GeV) must be equal to or larger than twice the mass of the fermion. So m_X >= 2*m_f.

So let's list the known ferm
