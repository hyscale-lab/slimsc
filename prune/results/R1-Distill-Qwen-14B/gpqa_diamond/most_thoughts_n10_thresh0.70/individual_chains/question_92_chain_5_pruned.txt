Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds, maybe? Each of those double bonds is between carbons with different substituents. Wait, the formula has C=C in two places, so two double bonds.

The question provides bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, that's the energy needed to break a C-C bond in graphite into two atoms of carbon gas. But wait, when calculating enthalpy of formation, I think I need the bond energies to figure out the energy released or absorbed when the molecule is formed from its elements.

The bond energies are given as:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but when you form a molecule from its elements, you have to consider breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the products. For enthalpy of formation, the formula is usually: ΔH°f = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed). But wait, no, wait. Wait
