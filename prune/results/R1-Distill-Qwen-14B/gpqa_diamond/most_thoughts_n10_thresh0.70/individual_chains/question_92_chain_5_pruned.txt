Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific hydrocarbon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. It looks like it has two double bonds. The formula probably has multiple CH3 groups attached. Maybe it's a conjugated diene or something similar. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure right now. But the question is about the enthalpy of formation, so I think that involves bond energies.

The problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond into individual atoms. So for carbon, it's the energy to break a C-C bond, I suppose. Wait, no, the bond energies given are C-C, C=C, etc. So the enthalpy of atomization is probably the energy to turn a solid carbon into gaseous atoms, but maybe that's a separate value used for calculating bond energies. Hmm.

The other given bond energies are H-H (100 kJ/mol), C-C (200), C=C (300), and C-H (400). So when calculating the enthalpy of formation, I think I need to consider the bonds broken in the reactants (like elements in their standard states) and the bonds formed in the product.

The standard enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for hydrocarbons, that's carbon (probably as graphite) and hydrogen gas (H2).

Wait, but the given data includes bond energies, which are used in the bond enthalpy approach. So the method would be to calculate the total energy of the bonds broken in the reactants minus the bonds formed in the products.

Alternatively, another approach is to take the standard enthalpy of atomization of each element, subtract the bond energies for the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, maybe using the formula: ΔHf° = Σ [ (atoms in elements) ] - Σ [ bonds in molecule ].

Wait
