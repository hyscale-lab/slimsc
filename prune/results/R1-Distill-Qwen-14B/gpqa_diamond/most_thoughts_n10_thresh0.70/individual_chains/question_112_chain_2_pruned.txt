Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |α> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form a basis for the spin-1/2 system. Since the state is given proportionally, I'll probably need to normalize it first to find the exact coefficients.

Then, the problem asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is 2x2, since it's for spin-1/2, right?

Wait, let's think about the dimensions. The operator is acting on a two-level system because the state |α> is a combination of |up> and |down>. So the matrix A has dimensions 2x2. The elements where i≠j are ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. Let me write that matrix out:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, that's correct. Because for i=1, j=2 and i=2, j=1, they're non-zero. Diagonals (i=j) are zero.

So this operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that looks familiar. I think such an operator has eigenstates that are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices, perhaps.

Wait, Pauli matrices are usually represented with different elements. Let me see. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. So the operator A seems proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because if I factor out ħ/2, then A is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] which is (ħ/2) times sigma_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are the same as the eigenstates of A, right? Because it's a scaled version. So the eigen
