Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so that's a proportional statement, which means it's not normalized yet. I think I need to normalize it first. Because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

So, the state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2 - i)|down>, where a is the proportionality constant. Wait, no, actually, the question says it's proportional, so it's just (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>, but I have to find a such that the state is normalized. Because the sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1.

Right, so the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>. Let me calculate the squared magnitudes. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So the square is 2. Similarly, (2 -i)'s magnitude is sqrt( (2)^2 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(4 +1)= sqrt(5). So the square is 5.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2 +5) = 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [1/sqrt(7)] (1+i)|up> + [1/sqrt(7)] (2 -i)|down>.

Next part of the question is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator with matrix A. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix. Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the basis is |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z.

Wait, what does A look like? Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2.

So A would be:
[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[
