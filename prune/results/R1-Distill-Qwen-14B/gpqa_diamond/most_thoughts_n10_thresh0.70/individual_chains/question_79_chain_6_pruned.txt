Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in specific conditions, and then analyzing the resulting NMR spectra. Hmm, what do I remember about these reactions?

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, right? Oh, right, it's used as a catalyst in certain eliminations. Oh, like in the elimination of epoxides. Oh! So if compound X is an epoxide, reacting with this base might lead to an elimination reaction. Because when epoxides are treated with strong bases, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, I think the conditions here might be more about ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, no. Wait, the reaction is between compound X and DBU (which is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) in a nonpolar solvent at high temperature (403 K). I think DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So in such conditions, I'd expect an elimination reaction, maybe an E2 mechanism. So if compound X is an epoxide, the base could deprotonate a beta hydrogen, leading to the opening of the epoxide ring and the formation of an alkene.

So the product would be an alkene. Now, the NMR of the product is given. Let me look at the NMR data. Let's start with the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR shows several signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): That's probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an electronegative atom or a benzene ring.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet methyl. Could be another methyl group, perhaps on a benzene ring like in a toluene derivative.
- The aromatic region has several signals: 
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d)
   - δ 7.08 (2H, d)
   - δ 7.68 (1H, d)
   - δ 7.71 (2H, d)
Wait, looking at these, I see two doublets with 2H each and one each with 1H. Hmmm, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause splitting. Or maybe it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, leading to a conjugated system.

Wait, the aromatic protons are part of a conjugated diene or something? Or maybe a styrene-type structure. Let me think.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:
- 21.3 (1C, s): That's a low chemical shift, probably a methyl group attached to something like a benzene ring (like a toluene methyl).
- 28.4 (1C, s): A little higher shift, maybe another methyl. Hmm, but wait, 28 ppm is more like a CH2 or maybe a CH3 attached to something else. Or perhaps a bridgehead in a bicyclic structure, but not sure.
- The rest are in the aromatic region. Let me list them:
   126.9 (2C, s) — two equivalent carbons, maybe part of a para-substituted ring or a symmetrical structure.
   127.1 (1C, s) — a single carbon, maybe a substituent.
   129.1 (2C, s) — another two equivalent carbons.
   130.3 (1C, s) — single carbon, possibly a quaternary carbon?
   141.5 (1C, s) — that's a high value, maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic carbon attached to something else, like an oxygen.
   144.1 (1C, s) — even higher, maybe a carbonyl or an epoxide carbon, but in the product, since the epoxide would have opened, perhaps an sp2 hybridized carbon.
Wait, the product is from the reaction of X with DBU. If X is an epoxide, and the product is an alkene, then maybe the 13C NMR shows the carbons from the alkene.

Wait, but in the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7 (1C, s). That's a very high shift. 197 is around where ketones or aldehydes are. Wait, but
