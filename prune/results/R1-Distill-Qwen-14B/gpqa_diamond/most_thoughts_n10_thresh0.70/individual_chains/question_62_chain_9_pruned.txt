Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to know what the target molecule looks like. The name suggests a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is further attached to another cyclohexane ring that has a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). Wait, no, wait. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a hydroxymethyl group (like a -CH(OH)CH2- group). And the cyclohexane ring also has a carbonyl group, so maybe a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, the end is "carbaldehyde," so it's an aldehyde group. So the cyclohexane ring has a -CHO group.

Now, starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond, so a -Câ‰¡CH group).

I need to figure out the steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about the possible reactions.

Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Common reactions for terminal alkynes include hydration, which can form either ketones (acid catalyzed, with HgSO4 as catalyst, like in the oxymercuration) or aldehydes (maybe via other methods). But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclic alkyne. If I perform a hydration, I could add water across the triple bond.

Wait, but sometimes alkynes can be converted into alkenes via hydrogenation. Using H2 with a catalyst like Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, but if I use more H2 and a different catalyst, maybe Lindlar's, I could get cis or trans addition. But in this case, perhaps the triple bond
