Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think about it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The problem says the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, the operator P is a vector operator, probably like the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, no, wait. The components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Right, each component is a matrix. For P_x, the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix, and P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix—each multiplied by ħ/2.

The operator P is the vector operator, so when you have a direction n, say (nx, ny, nz), then the operator along n would be P·n = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, it means ny = 0. So the operator becomes P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. And we need to find the eigenvector when this operator acts on it, with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvector equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Wait, wait, no—the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, the equation would be:

(nx P_x + nz P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but each component P_x, etc., is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So, let me write that out.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So then, P·n would be (ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ].

So the operator along n is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. So, the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can factor out the ħ/2, so we have:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, no, because the right side is (ħ/2) |ψ>. So, the equation is:

(ħ/2) * M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, where M is the matrix [[
