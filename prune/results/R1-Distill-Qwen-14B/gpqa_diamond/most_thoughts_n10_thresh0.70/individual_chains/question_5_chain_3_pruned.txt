Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement of that observable is made. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the eigenvector should satisfy the equation P|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Wait, but wait. The operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is in the x-z plane, which probably means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, right? So direction n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n would be along the x and z directions. Hmm, maybe it's just (cosθ, 0, sinθ) or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure, maybe that detail affects the operator's matrix.

Wait, but the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. So the total operator P is probably the vector operator, meaning P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. Or wait, no, in quantum mechanics, operators are often represented as vectors when they're angular momentum operators. So the operator P here might be analogous to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each multiplied by ħ/2, perhaps. So the operator components given for Px, Py, Pz are indeed proportional to the Pauli matrices. So the operator P would be P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z, where x, y, z are the direction unit vectors. So for a direction n, the operator would be P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait but the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is in x-z, meaning n_y = 0. So the operator P would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z. So the matrix would be a combination of the matrices of P_x and P_z.

But wait, the problem asks for the eigenvector of the operator P along direction n. So the operator in the direction of n is P·n. So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

So I need to construct the matrix for P·n and then find its eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the matrix representation of P·n. Since n is in the x-z plane, its components are (n_x
