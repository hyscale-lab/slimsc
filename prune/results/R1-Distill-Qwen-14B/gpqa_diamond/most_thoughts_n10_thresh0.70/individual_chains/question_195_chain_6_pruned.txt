Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is there's a star with a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. Around it, there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the orbital period is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet, which has a radius 2.5 times Earth's, and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have so that it both transits and occults. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm. Okay, so I think the key here is about orbital periods and how they relate to each other for the two planets to have both events. I remember that for a planet to transit, it needs to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. For occultation, it's when the planet passes behind the star, so it's hidden from view, I think.

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to the first one? Oh, maybe it's about the period ratio. Because both planets are in the same system and same orbital plane, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital periods are in a certain ratio so that they can align for both events.

I remember something about the Hill sphere or maybe the Roche limit, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. Alternatively, it's more about orbital mechanics and the conditions for transit and occultation.

Wait, another thought: for a planet to undergo both transit and occultation, it must be in the same orbital plane as the first planet. But more importantly, their orbital periods must be such that the second planet's orbital period is longer than the first's. Because if it's longer, the first planet would be moving faster, so it can pass in front and behind. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, no, the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on as seen from Earth. So both have the same inclination, which is given. So their orbital periods and distances are the main factors.

Wait, maybe I should think about the orbital distance. The orbital period is related to the distance from the star via Kepler's third law. So, for the first planet, let me find its distance from the star.
