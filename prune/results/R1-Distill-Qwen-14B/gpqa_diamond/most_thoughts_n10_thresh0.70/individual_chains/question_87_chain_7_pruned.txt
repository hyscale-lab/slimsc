Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total, and the IR data shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Hmm, wait. Let me start by visualizing the structure. A 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's benzene-based. Di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. The total carbon count is 8, so the benzene has 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 more. But wait, that's only 8. Oh, wait, substituents can have more carbons. Wait, 6-membered ring with two substituents, each substituent might have multiple carbons.

Wait, the IR indicates a carbonyl group. So one substituent is likely a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone or an aldehyde. The other substituent has an aromatic-halogen bond, so it's probably a halogen like chlorine or bromine attached directly to the ring.

Wait, but a di-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and a halogen. Let me think about possible structures. One common structure is when the benzene has a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen substituent. But how would the substituents be arranged?

Alternatively, the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group) and a halogen. Wait, but if one substituent has a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone attached to the ring. For example, acetophenone has a ketone attached to the benzene. But that's mono-substituted. If it's di-substituted, then there's another group, like a halogen.

Wait, but the problem says the compound has two substituents on the ring. So perhaps one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and the other is a halogen. But wait, the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen. So the substituents are -X (like Cl) and -CO-something.

Wait, but if the substituents are -X and -COR, where COR is a carb
