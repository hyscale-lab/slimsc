Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which undergoes a reaction. The product's NMR data is given, and the options are various epoxides or similar structures. I remember that in such reactions, sometimes epoxides are involved, maybe opening or something else. Wait, the reaction condition is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane... Oh, wait, that's a base, right? It's often used as a base in reactions like the deprotection of silyl ethers or maybe in some eliminations.

Wait, or maybe it's used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. But if compound X is reacting with a base, perhaps it's an epoxide that's undergoing some kind of ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination or a rearrangement. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the reaction mechanism here. Maybe I should focus more on the NMR data to figure out the structure.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). Two singlets, each integrating for 3H. So, two methyl groups, each as singlets. Singlets mean they're probably attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons, like attached to an electronegative atom or maybe a quaternary carbon.

- Then, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). The protons here are in the aromatic region. Let's see: two doublets at around 6.75 and 7.08. Wait, doublets with 1H and 2H. Hmm. Maybe a substituted benzene ring with some substituents causing splitting. Let me think of coupling patterns.

In aromatic regions, when you have a doublet, it's often from a coupling with one neighboring proton. So, for example, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton is coupled with two others, but in some cases, you get doublets if the coupling is between two protons. Wait, maybe it's a trans coupling in a di-substituted ring.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows four aromatic signals: 1H d, 2H d, 1H d, and 2H d. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with some substituents. Or perhaps it's a substituent that causes different coupling.

Wait, looking more carefully: the four signals in the aromatic region. Let's count the number of protons. 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 protons. So, a benzene ring with six protons, which suggests that it's fully substituted? No, wait, because a benzene ring has 6 protons. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that they split the ring into these multiplets.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are causing the ring to have different types of protons. Let's think about a styrene group (vinyl benzene). Styrene has a vinyl group attached to a benzene. In the case of styrene, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the ortho and para to the vinyl group.

Wait, styrene's 1H NMR typically shows a triplet around δ 7.2-7.4 for the aromatic protons, but that's without substituents. Alternatively, maybe in this case, the substituent is causing more splitting.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region. Let's think: perhaps a di-substituted benzene. For example, a para-substituted benzene with another substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group attached, leading to some coupling.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a compound with two substituents on the benzene ring. For example, a methyl group and another substituent. Or maybe the compound has two substituents leading to four different types of protons.

But let me look at the 13C NMR data for more clues.

13C NMR:
- δ 21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s): these are likely to be two methyl carbons. The values suggest they might be attached to oxygen
