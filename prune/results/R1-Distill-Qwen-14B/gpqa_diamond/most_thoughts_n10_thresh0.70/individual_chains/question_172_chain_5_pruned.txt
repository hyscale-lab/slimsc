Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and maybe the Saha equation, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think through this.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can apply the relevant physics equations for LTE.

Wait, LTE means that the properties of the gas can be described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and the Saha equation for ionization, but here we're talking about excitation levels, which is more about the Boltzmann factor. Oh right! The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states.

The Boltzmann equation in its simplified form is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where n_i is the number of particles in state i, g_i is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say E_i is the higher energy level, and E_j is the lower. So, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, no: the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So n_i (excited state) in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So, n1 = 2 * n2.

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars because it's the same element and same energy levels. So g_i / g_j is 1. Then the equation simplifies to n1 / n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), because for each star, the denominator would be the lower energy state. Wait, actually, for each star, the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)).
