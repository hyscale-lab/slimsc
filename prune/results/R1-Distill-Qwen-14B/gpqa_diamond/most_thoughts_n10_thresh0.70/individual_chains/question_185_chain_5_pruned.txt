Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of the system, and eigenvalues correspond to possible energy measurements.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Right, the Pauli matrices... Each component σx, σy, σz are 2x2 matrices. So, σ · n would be the dot product, which is σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix vector multiplied by a unit vector would be related to their properties. Wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when they're multiplied by a unit vector, the overall operator might have a different scaling.

Wait, more generally, any spin operator in the direction of n would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 times the gyromagnetic ratio or something. But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The general form for the eigenvalues of a spin operator. The spin component in any direction has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is ε times the Pauli vector dotted with n. So, H = ε (σ · n).

Each Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. So, when you have a sum like σ · n, each term is σ_i multiplied by n_i. The sum will be a 2x2 matrix. What's the trace? The trace would be n_x Tr(σ_x) + n_y Tr(σ_y) + n_z Tr(σ_z). But each σ_i is traceless, so the trace is zero. That makes sense because the eigenvalues should add up to zero.

What about the determinant? The determinant of σ · n. Let me think: For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (λ1)(λ2) - (sum of off-diagonal terms squared or something). Alternatively, for a general matrix A, if it's 2x2, determinant is ad - bc. But for σ · n, since it's a traceless matrix, the product of eigenvalues is the determinant. So, eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 satisfy λ1 + λ2 = 0 and λ1 λ2 = det(H). Wait, H is ε (σ · n). So H is a scalar multiple of σ · n. Let me factor ε out: H = ε (σ · n), so σ · n is a matrix with entries depending on n.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the eigenvalues directly. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1
