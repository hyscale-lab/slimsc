Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds from their NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting and integration can tell us a lot about the structure.

The problem states that the mixture is a 1:1 ratio of two compounds, both with formula C10H14. Wait, C10H14—so each is a mono-substituted benzene? No, wait, benzene has six carbons. So C10H14 would mean four substituents, each with a methyl group because each has one carbon. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene. Or wait, maybe one has two substituents, but that doesn't fit the H count. Let me think: benzene is C6H6. If each substituent is an ethyl group, that would add 2 carbons each. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. So 10 carbons minus 6 is 4, so four substituents each with one carbon (methyl). So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene. So substituents are methyl groups.

The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm. In aromatic regions, singlets are usually from equivalent protons. So maybe each compound has two sets of equivalent protons, each giving a singlet. Or perhaps each compound has two aromatic protons each, but in the mixture, it's a 1:1 ratio, so each contributes their own singlet?

Wait, no. The question says the mixture has two signals (singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in 1:1 ratio. Wait, but wait, the integration is in 1:1 for the aromatic region. Each aromatic signal is a singlet, and they are in 1:1 ratio. So perhaps each compound contributes one singlet each, and they are each in 1:1 ratio. So each compound has one set of equivalent aromatic protons, contributing a singlet, and the two are in 1:1 ratio in the mixture.

Then, the other part: three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in 2:1:1 ratio. So that's likely the methyl groups attached to the benzene. Because methyl groups next to substituents can split, but if they're all singlets, they must be equivalent in some way. Wait, but three signals—so maybe each compound has two or three different methyl groups.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. The options are:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Option C: 1,2,3,5 and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would be two ethyl groups, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me check: 1,4-diethylben
