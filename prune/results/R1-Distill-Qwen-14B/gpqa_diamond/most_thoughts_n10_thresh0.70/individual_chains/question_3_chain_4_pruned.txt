Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of expectation values and spin operators. But let's try to tackle this step by step.

So the question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. 

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable on a large number of identically prepared systems. The formula I remember is ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. Since expectation values are linear, the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations. So I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, yes. Because expectation is linear, so ⟨A+B⟩=⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩, and if there's a scalar multiple, like ⟨cA⟩=c⟨A⟩. So that's the plan.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's write this as a column vector to make things concrete. I think |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So |ψ⟩ would be [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So the state is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when we compute ⟨σz⟩, it's the expectation of σz in state |ψ⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is given by ψ† σz ψ. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, since
