Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations compare to those caused by an exoplanet. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star is about 1 R_sun. But wait, no, the question says the star's radius is equal to the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. Oh right, but when comparing to the exoplanet's radius, it's R_planet over R_star, so we need to find R_planet.

The star's Teff is 6000 K. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere, right? So the filling factor is 0.2. And the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K. Oh, but wait, the star itself has an effective temperature of 6000 K, so the spots are 5000 K.

The problem says that when only one hemisphere is spotty, the photometric observations show periodic brightness changes because the spots rotate into and out of view. These brightness changes can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. So, the question is, what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Wait, but the setup says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same signal. So, I think we need to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

First, let's figure out the brightness variation due to the spots. When the spots are on the visible side, they make the star appear dimmer. The brightness variation (delta F) depends on the area covered by the spots and their temperature difference.

The flux from a star is proportional to R^2 * T^4. But in this case, part of the star is cooler. So the total flux when spots are visible would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since it's one hemisphere, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4Ï€ R^2) ), wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is already the fraction.
