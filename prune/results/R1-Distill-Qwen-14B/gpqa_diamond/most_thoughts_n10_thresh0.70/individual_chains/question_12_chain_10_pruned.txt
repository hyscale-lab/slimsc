Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a Pi(+) particle, which is stationary, decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). I think the neutrino is probably a neutrino, but I'm not entirely sure, but I guess that's what the notation 'nu' stands for.

The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles, which are the mu(+) and the neutrino. The options given are A to D, each with two values. I need to figure out which pair is correct.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the total momentum of the products after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. I think the neutrino has a very small mass, but in many cases, especially in high-energy physics, it's considered to have zero mass. I'll have to check that. If the neutrino is massless, that would simplify things.

So, the rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I don't know the mass of the neutrino, but I think it's negligible here. Let's proceed assuming it's zero.

The decay equation is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. So, the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino has effectively zero mass.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Now, the energy of each particle after decay is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

But wait, E_pi is the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. So,

139.6 = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + (E_nu)

But the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. So,

E_nu = K_nu.

So,

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu

So, the sum of the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino is 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now, considering conservation of momentum. The pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the vector sum of the muon's and neutrino's momenta must be zero. So, the magnitude of their momenta must be equal and opposite.

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, and that of the neutrino as p' (but since they're opposite, p' = -p). But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is |p'| c, because for massless particles, E = pc.

Wait, but particles with mass have E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). But since p is in units where c is 1 (like MeV and such), perhaps I can work in natural units where c=1, so E² = p² + m².

So, for the muon:

E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² )

And for the neutrino, since m_nu ≈ 0,

E_nu = p_nu.

But since the momenta are equal and opposite, p_nu = p_mu, so E_nu = p_mu.

Wait, but the neutrino's momentum is equal in magnitude to the muon's. So, p_nu = p_mu. So E_nu = p_mu.

Now, I have the energies:

E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² )

E_nu = p.

And from energy conservation:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

So,

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p.

Hmm, this looks like an equation I can solve for p.

Let me set sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = x. So,

x = 139.6 - p.

Then,

x² = p² + (105.7)^2.

Substituting x,

(139.6 - p)^2 = p² + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 * p + p² = p² + (105.7)^2.

Simplify:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p = (105.7)^2.

Compute the squares:

139.6² is 139.6 * 139.6. Let me calculate that:

139.6 * 139.6: Let's compute 140^2 = 19600, but since it's 139.6, which is 0.4 less than 140.

Wait, 139.6 = 140 - 0.4.

So,

(140 - 0
