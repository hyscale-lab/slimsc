Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the aperture is an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is falling vertically on this aperture, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large.

Wait, so first, I should probably recall what an apothem is. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So all apothems being the same length 'a' means it's a regular polygon, right?

When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. Oh wait, but wait, no. Wait, if all apothems are the same, but when N approaches infinity, it's a circle. But wait, in a circle, the concept of an apothem doesn't exactly apply because all points are equidistant from the center. So maybe the 'a' here is the radius of the circle when N approaches infinity?

Wait, but the question is about the far field diffraction pattern. So when the aperture is a circle, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk, right? But the question is about minima in the intensity. For a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/(π a), but wait, that's the formula for the first minimum. So the angle between the first and second minima would be the difference between the angles of these minima.

Wait no, the first minimum is the first dark ring. But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the minima occur at θ values given by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a, and the second minimum is higher, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, but wait. The problem is not about a circular aperture, but about an N-sided polygon. But N is approaching infinity, so it's effectively a circle. So maybe the problem is a way to approach the circle case. But the
