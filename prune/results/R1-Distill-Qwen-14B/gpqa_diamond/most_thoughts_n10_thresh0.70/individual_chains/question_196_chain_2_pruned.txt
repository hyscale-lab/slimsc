Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are a bit different.

The setup: a 1D oscillator with mass m, maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, so it's obeying Hooke's law. We're looking for v_max in terms of c, the speed of light.

In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the maximum speed comes from setting this equal to (1/2)m v_max². So v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But that's option C, which is probably the classical answer. Since this is a relativistic problem, the correct answer must be something else.

Wait, but in relativity, as an object's speed approaches c, its relativistic mass increases. Or wait, no—maybe I should think in terms of relativistic energy. The total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, right?

So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the same at all points in its oscillation. At maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic.

But wait, in the relativistic scenario, the kinetic energy
