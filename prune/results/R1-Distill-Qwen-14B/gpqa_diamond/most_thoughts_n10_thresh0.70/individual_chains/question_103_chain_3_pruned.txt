Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of steps, and I need to figure out which one is the right order.

Let me think about the target molecule first. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The 3 position has a bromine, and the 5 position has a nitro group. Additionally, there's a ketone group attachedâ€”so that would be the ethan-1-one part. Ethanone is (propan-2-one?), right? Wait, no, ethan-1-one would be a ketone in a two-carbon chain. Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is actually not possible because the ketone would be on the first carbon, which isn't feasible. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's acetophenone-type structure where the ketone is attached to the benzene.

Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone part is CH3-C(O)- attached to the benzene ring. The benzene has substituents at 3 and 5 positions: Br and NO2.

So the benzene ring substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Let me visualize the benzene ring: if one substituent is at position 3 (let's say Br), then the other (NO2) would be at position 5. Wait, in benzene, numbering starts where? It depends on the substituents. For two substituents, the lower numbering is chosen. So perhaps the nitro is at position 3 and Br at position 5? Or vice versa.

Wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl group. So the benzene ring has Br at position 3, NO2 at position 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, meaning they are meta to each other.

So the plan is to introduce these groups in the correct order and positions
