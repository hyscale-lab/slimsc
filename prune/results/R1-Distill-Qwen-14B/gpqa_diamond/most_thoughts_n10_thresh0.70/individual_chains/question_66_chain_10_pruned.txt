Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, and the options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, let me think about each symmetry one by one. I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. Because the SM itself is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz-invariant, so that's a yes for number 1.

What about Poincare symmetry? Oh, wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like spacetime translations). But wait, when we talk about the SMEFT, it's more about the local symmetries, but operators in SMEFT are built respecting the symmetries at each point. So I think that any operator in SMEFT must be invariant under Poincare symmetry, because that includes the spacetime translations which are necessary for a consistent field theory. So number 2 should also be a yes. Or wait, sometimes people might confuse whether SMEFT includes Poincare or just Lorentz. But since Poincare is a broader symmetry, and SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincare as well. So 1 and 2 are both required.

Now, what about CP symmetry? I'm a bit fuzzy here. The Standard Model is CP symmetric except for certain parts like the CKM phase which is a source of CP violation. So, in the SM, not all operators respect CP. Therefore, in SMEFT, I think the operators can have terms that violate CP, right? Because SMEFT allows for all possible operators, including those that break CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So number 3, CP symmetry, is not a must-respect symmetry. So options that include 3 are probably incorrect.

Then CPT symmetry. CPT is a big one in quantum field theory. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be CPT-symmetric. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So number 4 is definitely a yes.

So let's recap: which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So options 1,2, and 4 must be respected.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4: So that's correct.

Option A is 1,2 only. But wait, do they include CPT? Because the question says "all operators", and SMEFT must respect CPT for each operator. So C is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. Poincare symmetry. SMEFT is a field theory, and all terms must be Poincare-invariant because field theories in a relativistic sense must be. So yes, 1 and 2 are correct. So the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.

Wait, but wait. The Poincare group includes translations and Lorentz. SMEFT's operators are local, so they have to transform covariantly under Lorentz, but each operator is a local operator, so perhaps the Poincare symmetry (which includes the translations) isn't required on each operator's form, but rather the theory as a whole is Poincare invariant. Hmm, but the question is about each operator. So each operator must be invariant under Lorentz and translation? Or maybe not. Wait, no, because each operator is a term in the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian must be translation invariant, meaning that the entire Lagrangian is the same everywhere. So each term in the Lagrangian must be such that when you act with translations, the term doesn't change.
