Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think that's lithium-6 because lithium usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which probably refers to the kinetic energy of the ions. I remember that in particle accelerators, the energy given is often the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. I need to be careful here.

So, the first thing is to figure out the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which is an isotope of lithium. The mass number A is 6 (3 protons + 3 neutrons). I think the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of the individual nucleons. A proton has a mass of about 1.007276 GeV/c² (wait, no, actually, the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c², which is 0.938 GeV/c²). Similarly, a neutron is about 939 MeV/c², so 0.939 GeV/c². Let me get that right.

So for Li-6, A is 6, so the total rest mass is approximately 6 times the average of proton and neutron masses. Wait, actually, each proton is about 1.0073 GeV/c² (wait, no, that's the atomic mass. Oh wait, no—wait, no. Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², so 0.938 GeV/c². Similarly, neutron is about 940 MeV/c², so 0.940 GeV/c². So the average would be roughly around 0.939 GeV/c² per nucleon. Let me think: For a light nucleus, the binding energy isn't too significant, so the total mass is roughly A times the mass of a nucleon. So for Li-6, mass M = 6 * 0.938 GeV/c²? Wait, no—wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 proton is 0.938 GeV/c², but when you have multiple nucleons, the total mass isn't exactly A times the individual masses because of binding energy, but for this problem, I think it's acceptable to approximate the mass as roughly A times the mass of a proton (or neutron), since the binding energy is small compared to the rest mass. So, let's proceed with that.

So, M = 6 * (0.938 GeV/c²) ≈ 5.628 GeV/c². Wait, but wait: let me check the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe the mass is given by the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So, for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, M = 3*(m_p) + 3*(m_n). m_p is about 0.93
