Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are A to D, with some GeV values. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the theory of special relativity. The energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and its velocity. The formula I recall is the total energy, E, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, mc². So E = gamma * m c². 

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Wait, the question gives v as 0.96c. So let me plug that into gamma. Let's compute it step by step. 

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². 

So 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then, sqrt(0.0784) is... Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784). Well, 0.0784 is 784e-4, so sqrt(784) is 28, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. 

So gamma = 1 / 0.28. Let's see, 1 divided by 0.28 equals approximately 3.5714. Wait, double-checking: 0.28 times 3 is 0.84. 0.28 times 3.57 is 0.28 * 3.5714. Let me compute 0.28 *3.5714. 

Wait, 3.5714 is actually 25/7, because 25/7 is approximately 3.5714. So 25/7 * 0.28 is (25 *0.28)/7. 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So 25 *7/25 =7, divided by 7 is 1. So yes, 3.5714 is 25/7, which when multiplied by 0.28 gives 1. So gamma is 25/7, approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the next step is to find the rest mass of the nucleus X. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? The standard lithium has an atomic number of 3. So Li has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 3+3=6 nucleons. So the isotope is Li-6. 

The mass of Li-6 is needed. The atomic mass is approximately the sum of protons and neutrons in atomic mass units. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. 

Let me compute that. 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) )= 6.047823 u. 

Wait, but wait. Actually, the exact mass of Li-6 is known. I think it's about 6.015 u. Hmm, but let me think. The exact value might be needed. Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Oh wait, maybe I can look up the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Let me think. I remember that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c² (when converted using 1u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c²). Wait, but perhaps the exact mass isn't necessary if I can find the rest energy in another way.

Wait, no, maybe I can find the rest mass in GeV. Let me think. Alternatively,
