Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, ranging from 1e-15 m to 1e-16 m. 

Wait, I remember that the decay length of a particle depends on its lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I find τ from the given parameters?

I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime. Oh, right! The uncertainty principle: Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. Specifically, τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units need to be consistent. Γ is given in MeV, so I'll need to convert that into energy units that work with ħ.

So, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I remember that ħc is a common unit in particle physics. Let me recall the values. ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and I think 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 joules. But maybe I should just work in natural units where c=1 and use the appropriate conversions.

Wait, another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert it into GeV to match the units of ħ. Since 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate 6.582 / 0.32. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is indeed approximately (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32: let's compute that accurately. 0.32 * 20 =6.4, so 0.32 *20.56875 = 6.582. So yes, that's correct. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X=1.2 GeV. I can calculate the Lorentz factor gamma from E = gamma * m c². But since we're using units where c=1, it's simply E = gamma m.

So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 2.666... So gamma is 2.6667 approximately. 

Gamma is also equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), so sqrt(1 - v²) = 1/gamma. So 1 - v² = 1/(gamma²). v² = 1 - (1/(gamma²)). Let's compute that. 

Gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 ≈ 42.6667. 1/(gamma squared) is 1/42.6667 ≈ 0.0234375. So 1 - 0.0234375 = 0.9765625. So v squared is 0.9765625. Taking square root, v ≈ sqrt(0.9765625) = approximately 0.9882 c. Hmm, wait, sqrt(0.9765625) is 0.9882? Let me compute this: 0.9882 squared is approximately (0.988)^2 = 0.976, so yes, that's correct. So v ≈ 0.9882 c.

Wait, but wait a second. The exact value of 0.9765625 is (244/250)²? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as a decimal. 0.9765625 is exactly equal to 1 - (1/42.6667) = 1 - (3/128) = 125/128. Wait, 128 * 0.9765625 = 125. So yes, v² is 125/128. Wait, 125/128 is 0.9765625. So sqrt(125/128) = sqrt(125)/sqrt(128). Let's compute that.

sqrt(125) is 5*sqrt(5) ≈ 5 * 2.23607 ≈ 11.18035. sqrt(128) is 8*sqrt(2) ≈ 8 *1.41421 ≈11.3137. So 11.18035 / 11.3137 ≈ 0.98815. So v ≈ 0.98815 c. That's a high velocity, which makes sense because the energy is much higher than the rest mass. 

So v ≈ 0.98815 c. But wait, what's the exact value? Let me calculate 0.9765625's square root accurately. Hmm, 0.9765625 = 31/32 is that correct? Wait 32/32 is 1, so 31/32 is 0.96875, which isn't correct. Wait, 125/128 is 0.9765625. So sqrt(125/128) = sqrt(125)/sqrt(128) = (5*sqrt(5)) / (8*sqrt(2)) ) . Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just multiply 0.98815 by the speed of light, c.

Now, the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So v ≈ 0.98815 * 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that. 0.98815 *3 = 2.96445e8 m/s. So v ≈ 2.96445e8 m/s.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the mean decay distance is L = v * τ. Plugging in the numbers: L = (2.96445e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = multiply the numbers.

Let me compute 2.96445e8 * 2.056875e-24. 2.96445 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see. 3 * 2 is 6, but let's do it more accurately. 2.96445 * 2.056875. Let me compute 2.96445 * 2 =5.9289, 2.96445 *0.056875. Hmm. 0.056875 is 56875e-6. 2.96445 * 0.056875 = 0.16863 approximately. So total is 5.9289 +0.16863 ≈6.0975. So L≈6.0975e(8-24) =6.0975e-16 m.

Wait, but wait: 1e8 *1e-24 = 1e-16. So 6.0975e-16 meters. Hmm. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 5.0223e-16 m, option D is 4.0655e-16. Hmm, none match 6e-16. Did I make a miscalculation somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check. Gamma is E / m. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So yes, 8/1.2 is 20/3, which is about 6.6667. Oh wait wait! Wait a second, no, 8 / 1.2 is 80/12 = 20/3 ≈6.6667, not 2.6667 as I thought earlier. Oh no, I messed up that calculation. Oh no, that's a big error.

Wait, so wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) but since c=1 in these units, it's E/(m) =8 /1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667, not 2.6667. That's where I messed up. So everything after that was wrong. Oh, that's a big mistake. So let me correct this.

So gamma is 6.6667. So gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444. So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - v² = 1/(gamma squared) → v² =1 - 0.0225= 0.9775. So v = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887 c. Wait, 0.9887 squared is approximately 0.9775, yes.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately. Hmm, 0.9887^2 is 0.9775. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. So v is approximately 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Previously, I calculated that as 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, but let me double-check that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is indeed 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So now, L = v * τ = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 2.9661 * 2.056875 * 1e(8-24) → 2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.9661 * 2.056875. Let's break it down. 2 * 2.9661 is 5.9322. 0.056875 * 2.9661 ≈ 0.1684. So total is 5.9322 + 0.1684 ≈ 6.099. So L ≈6.099e-16 meters. Hmm. But again, the options don't have this value. The options are about 4e-15, 5e-16, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24:

2.9661e8 = 2.9661 * 1e8 = 2.9661 * 10^8

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 * 10^-24

Multiply them:

2.9661 * 2.056875 = let me compute this exactly.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322

2.9661 * 0.056875 = let's compute 2.9661 * 0.05 = 0.148305, 2.9661 * 0.006875= approx 0.020413. So 0.148305 + 0.020413 = 0.168718.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.168718 =6.100918.

So 6.100918e(8-24) =6.100918e-16 meters.

Hmm. The options don't have 6e-16. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of τ? Let me recheck: τ= ħ/Γ.

ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875e-25 GeV·s / GeV → units become seconds. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the decay length formula is different. I'm using L = v * τ. But wait, the velocity here is in the lab frame, so I think that's correct. But perhaps I need to consider relativistic effects differently. Or maybe I should compute the mean lifetime in the rest frame and then apply time dilation.

Wait, another approach: The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Because from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So perhaps I shouldn't have used tau as ħ/Γ, but that's the proper lifetime, and the lab frame is longer. Wait, wait, no.

Wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is τ= ħ / Γ. But wait, in the rest frame, the lifetime is τ0= ħ/Γ. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by τ0. Because from the lab frame, the particle is moving, so time is dilated. So the lifetime is longer: τ_lab= gamma * τ0.

Wait, no, I think I got this wrong earlier. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is the same in all frames, because it's a property of the particle. But the lifetime τ is different. The proper lifetime (rest frame) is τ0 = ħ / Γ. The lifetime in the lab frame is τ_lab = gamma * tau_0, because moving clocks run slower. Wait, wait, no: from the lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime is longer. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

But earlier, I used tau = ħ / Γ, which is the proper lifetime. So if I use that, and then multiply by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime, then the decay length would be v multiplied by gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but earlier I calculated tau as the proper lifetime, and then used v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau_0. So in my initial approach, I must have made a mistake by not considering the time dilation. Because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer, so decay length is longer.

Wait, in the initial calculation, I did L = v * tau, where tau was the proper lifetime. But that's wrong because the lifetime in the lab frame is longer. So I should have used tau_lab = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is ħ/Γ. So correct calculation is L = v * gamma * (ħ / Γ).

So let's redo the calculation correctly.

First, calculate tau_0 = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24.

20/3 is approx 6.6667. So tau_lab = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute 2.056875e-24 * 6.6667.

6 * 2.056875 =12.34125e-24, 0.6667*2.056875≈1.37795e-24. So total is approx 12.34125 +1.37795=13.7192e-24 s, which is 1.37192e-23 s.

Wait, no, wait, 6.6667 is approx 20/3, so 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875) /3 e-24. 20 *2.056875=41.1375. 41.1375 /3 =13.7125e-24 s =1.37125e-23 s.

So tau_lab is 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Then, L = v * tau_lab. v is approximately 0.9887 c = 0.9887*3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So L=2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = let's compute 2.966 *1.37125 = approx 4.0729e(8-23) =4.0729e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.07e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close to this value. Alternatively, option C is 5.02e-15, which is higher.

Wait, but why did I get this different result when I corrected for the time dilation? Because earlier, I forgot to multiply by gamma, so I had a shorter decay length, which led to 6e-16, but that's not matching any option. When I include the gamma factor, I get around 4e-15, which matches option B.

But wait, let me redo the exact calculation.

tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.66666667.

tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = (20/3)*2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24) /3.

20 * 2.056875 =41.1375. 41.1375 /3 =13.7125e-24 s → 1.37125e-23 s.

v = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) → but in our case, since E = gamma m c^2, and we're using units where c=1, v = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) → sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) → sqrt(1 - 1.44/(64)) → sqrt(1 -0.0225) → sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887 c.

So v=0.9887 *3e8 m/s =2.966e8 m/s.

L = v * tau_lab =2.966e8 m/s *1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply 2.966e8 *1.37125e-23:

2.966 *1.37125 = let me compute this exactly.

2.966 *1 =2.966

2.966 *0.3 =0.8898

2.966 *0.07 =0.20762

2.966 *0.00125=0.0037075.

Adding up: 2.966 +0.8898 =3.8558, +0.20762=4.06342, +0.0037075=4.0671. So approximately 4.0671.

So 4.0671e(8-23) =4.0671e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but why did the initial approach without considering gamma give a different result? Because I forgot to include the time dilation factor. The initial calculation used the proper lifetime, leading to a shorter L, but the correct approach must account for the longer lifetime in the lab frame, which is why the decay distance is longer, matching option B.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B: 4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for decay length:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime in the lab frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the particle. The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

The lab frame lifetime is then given by time dilation:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau_0 \)
The decay width is \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Thus:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy of the meson is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined from the relation:

\[
v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
v = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887c \), where \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Therefore:

\[
v \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23})
\]

First, calculate the product of the coefficients:

\[
2.966 \cdot 1.37125 \approx 4.0671
\]

Then, combine the powers of 10:

\[
L \approx 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Compare with Options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.0671 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B** \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
