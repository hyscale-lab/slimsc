Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed, and determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. So, when it's dissolved in an acid, it should react. The acid is monobasic and strong, which I think means it will donate one H+ ion, like HCl or something. So, the reaction would be Fe(OH)3 reacting with the acid to form Fe^3+ ions and water.

First, I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. Molar mass calculation time. Let's see, Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So that's 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 g divided by 106.85 g/mol gives the moles. Let me calculate that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let's say approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a monobasic strong acid (like HCl) should be: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Wait, no, wait. Actually, Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so maybe the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions.

So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, so concentration is 0.1 mol/L. Volume needed is moles divided by concentration. So, 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. So that's about 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. But wait, maybe I made an approximation in the molar mass. Let me double-check.

Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17. So 3*(17) is 51. 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol correct. So 0.1 / 106.85 is
