Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has and doesn't have spots. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem again carefully. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The key point is about the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels. Without spots, the ratio is some value, and with spots, it's lower. They want the factor by which this ratio changes—so (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

Wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

So the ratio depends on the temperature. But wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. But I'm not sure if the spots affect the local temperature where the Ti lines form. Oh, wait, the problem says the stellar photosphere is in LTE, so I think the effective temperature is the same everywhere in the photosphere for each region. Hmm, but wait, spots are cooler regions. So when spots cover part of the surface, the overall effective temperature decreases. But the question is about the photosphere's temperature—so the areas without spots are hotter (6000 K) and the spots are cooler, say, maybe 5000 K? Or is the overall photospheric temperature 5500 K?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the problem again. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But the spots are cooler than the rest of the surface. So the original star without spots
