Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael reaction and some related additions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let's think through each part step by step.

The question gives three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C, and provides multiple-choice options for the products. My goal is to figure out the correct products for each and match them with the options.

Starting with reaction A: It's dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is an enolate donor because it's a diethyl malonate derivative, which is a good nucleophile.

So, in the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no, wait: wait, the structure is more accurately CH2=C(OCH3)-C(p-tolyl)-something? Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But when it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the acrylate chain. Let me get that right. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the beta carbon. Wait, noâ€”wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the acrylate is at position 1, 2, 3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh, wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the substituent is on the beta carbon. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but wait, that can't be right because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would mean the substituent is on the third carbon, which would be the gamma position. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that's not it. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl being at the 3-position. Wait, perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, and the p-tolyl group is attached to the CH2 group. So the structure might be CH2(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, that would make it (E)-3-(p
