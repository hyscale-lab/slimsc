Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again.

Astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the population of energy levels in atoms. Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The ratio is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, and ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the transition wavelength is given as 1448 Å. That must correspond to the energy difference between the two levels. The energy of a photon is E=hc/λ, right? So ΔE = hc/λ.

So I can calculate ΔE using this wavelength. Let's jot that down.

But wait, the problem says the ratio of n1 to n2 decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T)). So when the temperature decreases, the exponential term (ΔE/(k*T)) increases because denominator is smaller. So if T goes down, the exponent becomes a bigger positive number, making exp(ΔE/(kT)) larger. So n1/n2 increases, meaning n2/n1 decreases. Which aligns with the observation that n2/n1 decreases when spots are present.

So the ratio n2/n1 is smaller when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_with_spots.

So, let me think about the temperatures involved. When there are no spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does the overall Teff drop? Because the spots are cooler, but the rest is hotter? No, wait, I think the star's effective temperature is measured as the total emitted flux from the entire surface. If some parts are cooler (spots), and the others are the same, but the average goes down. But wait, in this problem, when the spots are present, the overall Teff is lower.

Wait, but the star's surface is a
