Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which usually happens when a compound has a chiral center or maybe some other form of asymmetry like a plane of chirality or something. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. No, wait, 1-chloro means the Cl is on the first carbon, and it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The configuration is Z. So for Z, the higher priority groups on each carbon (C1 and C2) are on the same side.

Wait, but for a molecule to be chiral, it needs to have no plane of symmetry and at least four different groups on a carbon. In this case, the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, butane is four carbons, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but 2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, C2 has a methyl, and double bond between C1 and C2. Let me visualize: the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. Then C3 and C4.

Wait, but the configuration is Z, so the substituents on each end of the double bond. For C1, the substituents are Cl and the rest. C1 is CH2Cl, but wait no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on the first carbon. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait that doesn't seem right
