Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps involved, so I'll need to follow each one carefully.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the steps. So, compound A reacts with HCN to produce B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and finally, D loses an inert gas to become E. The hints provided are a and b, so I need to consider those as well.

Looking at hint a, it says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, which forms alkenes. So, the reaction between A and the ylide produces an alkene. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to visualize that structure.

So, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is like (CH3)2C=, so it's a substituted cyclopentane with a double bond attached via the ylidene group. Wait, no, the ylidene group is a substituent on the ring, so perhaps it's part of a double bond.

Wait, the Wittig reaction forms alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So, compound A must be a ketone because it's reacting with a ylide to form an alkene. So, A is a ketone. That makes sense because the Wittig reaction typically takes a carbonyl group (like ketone) and converts it into an alkene.

So, if A is a ketone, then when it reacts with HCN, it would form a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is a reaction where a carbonyl group (like in a ketone) reacts with HCN to form a compound with an adjacent alcohol and nitrile group. So, compound B would be a cyanohydrin.

Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, usually under catalytic hydrogenation conditions. So, what gets reduced here? The cyanohydrin has a nitrile group and an alcohol. Nitriles can be reduced to amines, but more commonly, under H2 and Pd, nitriles are hydrogenated to amines, but wait, perhaps in this case, the nitrile is converted to an amine? Or maybe the double bond is hydrogenated if present. Wait, wait, in the cyanohydrin, there's no double bond. Let me think again.

Wait, the cyanohydrin structure is R2C(OH)CN. When B is hydrogenated, perhaps the nitrile group is being reduced. Nitrile (CN) can be reduced to a primary amine (CH2NH2) under certain conditions. But wait, under H2 and Pd, I think the nitrile would be hydrogenated to an amine. So, the OH group would become an O- (if deprotonated), but maybe in this case, it's protonated. So, the product C would have an amine group and maybe the OH becomes an alcohol again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the cyanohydrin has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carbon where the nitrile is attached. When we hydrogenate the nitrile, it becomes an amine. So, perhaps B is R2C(OH)CN, and upon hydrogenation, it becomes R2CH(NH2)CH2OH? Or maybe it's R2CH(OH)CH2NH2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this
