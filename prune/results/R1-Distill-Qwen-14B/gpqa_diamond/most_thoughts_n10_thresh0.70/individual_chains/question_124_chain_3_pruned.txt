Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about particles being collided in a detector. These particles are new types, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector is a sphere with a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, okay. So, the setup is that particles are produced and move outward, and we need to calculate the Lorentz factor that allows two-thirds of them to reach the detector's inner walls instead of one third.

Wait, I think the key here has to do with time dilation and gamma (the Lorentz factor). Because if the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) would be longer due to time dilation. So the time it takes for them to reach the detector walls is related to their proper lifetime multiplied by gamma.

Let me think. The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the distance they have to travel to reach the wall is the radius, which is 30 meters. The particles' speed is ultra-relativistic, so their velocity is approximately the speed of light, but maybe I can model it as exactly c for simplicity, since the velocity is so high.

The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees a longer lifetime, which is gamma multiplied by tau. So the time it takes for the particle to reach the detector wall is t = distance / velocity. Since velocity is approx c, t = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds, or 1e-7 s.

But wait, the particles are moving at speed v ≈ c. So the time to reach the wall is t = R / v, which is approximately R/(c) since v ≈ c.

But for a particle to reach the wall, its lab frame lifetime must be at least t. So the condition is that gamma * tau >= t. But wait, actually, the particles decay over time, so the fraction that reach
