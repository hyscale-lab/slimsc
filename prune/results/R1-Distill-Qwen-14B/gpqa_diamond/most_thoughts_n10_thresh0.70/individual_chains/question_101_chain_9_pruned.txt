Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what reagent A and catalyst B are used in the reaction.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's going on. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four CH2 groups and one NH. 3-Methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the first carbon. So, cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, making it a cyclohexene group. Wait, no, cyclohexylidene is a substituent where the cyclohexane is connected via a double bond. So, the product is a pyrrolidine ring with a CH2 group that's connected to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, the product structure is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent at position 1 is CH2-cyclohexene. How does that happen?

I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions often involve mechanisms like electrophilic addition or perhaps some kind of ring-opening or formation. Another possibility is an aldol reaction or some kind of
