Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question mentions that the compound was characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR typically indicate O-H stretches. A broad peak at 3000 could be from an alcohol (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a very broad and strong peak around that region. Also, they can sometimes show a peak around 2500-3300 from the O-H stretch, which overlaps with the broad region.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest an conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Another possibility is that the 1650 could be from an aromatic ring, but that's usually around 1450-1600 for aromatic C=C. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl?

Next, the ¹H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule has a double bond somewhere, maybe conjugated with a carbonyl group. That could explain the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak possibly being a C=C in conjugation with a carbonyl.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I need to think about what fragments give a mass of 45. Common fragments at 45 include the methyl group (but that's 15), or maybe a CH3O group? Wait, no. Wait, another possibility is a CH2O group, which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Alternatively, perhaps a (CH3)2CHO- or something. Wait, wait, 45 could be a fragment like CH3CH2O+ (which is 45?), or maybe a ketene ion? Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O... No, maybe I should consider common ions. Wait, 45 is the same as the molecular ion of acetone (propane-2-one), which is (CH3)2CO. But wait, acetone's molecular formula is C3H6O. Hmm, but how does that fit into the larger molecule here?

Now, the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let's list their degrees of unsaturation to see what structures they might have.

The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For C6H12O:
C=6, H=12.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

C6H10O:
DoU = (14 -10)/2=2. So two degrees, maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

C6H10O2:
DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So same as above, but with two oxygen atoms.

C6H12O2:
DoU=(14 -12)/2=1. So one degree, but with two oxygen atoms.

Now, looking at the IR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is probably O-H. So the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. Oh wait, but carboxylic acids would show a strong peak around 1700 (carbonyl) and the O-H would be very broad. So maybe it's an acid.

Wait, but if the IR has peaks at 1700 and 1650, that's two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring. But in that case, why is there a peak at 1700? Maybe it's an ester or something.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 could be a carbonyl, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. But that would tie in with the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So for example, something like a cyclohexenone derivative.

But let's think about the other data. The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which would mean the molecule has an alkene. So that's a double bond, which contributes to the degree of unsaturation.

The mass spec fragment at m/z 45. Let's list all possible options and their possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So one ring or double bond.

But wait, if O is 2, maybe it's a diol, but then where's the carbonyl? Or maybe a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have an ester group (carbonyl) and an ether linkage (O). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group. But wait, another thought: the presence of two O's and a carbonyl. So, for example, a molecule with an ester group and a hydroxyl group.

But let's think about the IR. If there's a hydroxyl (O-H) and a carbonyl (like ester or ketone), the IR would show the broad O-H peak, and the carbonyl around 1700.

Wait, but the IR has two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650. So perhaps two carbonyl groups. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Like, maybe an aromatic ring (C=C) and a carbonyl.

Wait, but the 1650 could be an aromatic ring. If the molecule has an aromatic ring (which would contribute to the DoU as 4 for benzene, but that's not possible with these formulas). Wait, let me check. For C6H10O2: DoU is 2. So if it's an aromatic ring (which requires 4 DoU), that's not possible. So maybe not an aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps a conjugated diene?

Wait, perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. So that would explain the vinyl H in the NMR.

So, putting it together:

- O-H (broad peak at 3000)
- Two carbonyl groups? Because two peaks at 1700 and 1650. Or one carbonyl and another group.

Wait, another possibility: the two peaks could be C=O and C=C. So, maybe an ester group (around 1700) and an alpha,beta-unsaturated group (1650, which would be the C=C in conjugation). That would fit with the vinyl H in the NMR.

So, the structure could be an ester with an alpha,beta-unsaturated group. For example, something like methyl acrylate, but with more carbons.

Wait, another thought: the mass spectrum fragment at 45. Let's consider possible fragments. 45 is the mass of CH3COO+ (acetate ion, 45), or maybe a methyl ester group breaking off.

Wait, acetate ion is (CH3COO-) with a mass of 60 (CH3COO- is 82, but I'm getting confused here). Wait
