Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. My task is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E, with options given as A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. So I need to find out what E is, determine its structure, and then figure out its symmetry group.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember that when metals react with halogens in certain conditions, they form colored products. For example, Copper (Cu) reacting with chlorine gas (Cl2) forms CuCl2, which is blue, but maybe if it's in a different oxidation state, the color changes. Wait, or maybe it's another metal. Oh, wait! I think when sodium reacts with chlorine, it forms NaCl, but that's a white solid. Alternatively, maybe it's something like the combination of metals with sulfur? Wait, but sulfur is a solid too. Hmm, another thought: maybe A is iron, because iron(III) oxide is reddish, but that's a solid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction like the formation of copper(II) sulfate, but that's a solution.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) oxide, but that's a red solid, though I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's lead oxide, which can be red. Or perhaps it's a reaction forming a metal sulfide, but those are usually black or yellow. Oh! Wait, I think I remember that when copper reacts with chlorine under certain conditions, like in the presence of excess Cl2, it forms CuCl2, which is blue. Alternatively, if A is iron and B is Cl2, then maybe they form FeCl3, which is yellow. But FeCl3 solution is yellow, but the solid is reddish-brown. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like phosgene (but that's COCl2, but I'm not sure if that's the case here). Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, so maybe it's something like Cl2 or another chlorine compound. Wait, maybe D is water? No, because in the third reaction, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. So D is probably a different gas.

Wait, let me list the reactions again:

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red product)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (used as a solvent), in 1:1 ratio.

Hmm, so what's H? The solvent. Common solvents are water, alcohol, ether, etc. But since D reacts with B in 1:1, perhaps H is
