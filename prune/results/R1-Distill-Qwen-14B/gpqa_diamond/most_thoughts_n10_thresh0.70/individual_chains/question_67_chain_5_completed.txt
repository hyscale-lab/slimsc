Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, right? Because p orbitals correspond to l=1.

The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so l1 is 1, l2 is 1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2. And m is -1. Right, so this is a coupled angular momentum state.

The problem asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z and getting -ħ for each. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -ħ.

I remember that for angular momentum, the eigenvalues are mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, Lz is mħ. So if we measure each L_z and get -ħ, that would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, since L1z |m1> = m1 ħ |m1>, and same for L2z.

But wait, the current state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. Let me think about how the state can be expressed in terms of the individual m1 and m2.

In coupled states, the total m is m1 + m2. So in our case, m= -1 = m1 + m2.

But if each electron's m is -1, then m1 + m2 would be -2. But here, the total m is -1. So that's a problem, right? Because that combination (m1=-1, m2=-1) would give a total m of -2, which doesn't match the given state's m of -1.

So how does that work? The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 that sum to -1. Because in the coupled state, you have to consider all possible ways m1 and m2 can add to the total m.

Wait, but the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, which is a specific state. So when you have two p orbitals (each l=1), the total angular momentum can be l=2 or l=0 or l=1? No, wait, when adding two angular momenta, l1 and l2, each 1, the possible total l values are l=2, 1, 0. So for l=2, the possible m values are from -2 to +2. So our state has l=2 and m=-1.

In this coupled state, the individual m1 and m2 can vary as long as m1 + m2 = -1.

So for the state |1,1,2,-1>, it's a superposition of states where m1 and m2 add up to -1. So for example, possible (m1, m2) pairs could be (-2, +1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2), etc. Wait, wait, no, because each m1 and m2 can only be -1, 0, +1 since each l=1. So the possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to m_total = -1 are:

m1 = -1 -> m2 = 0
m1 = 0 -> m2 = -1
m1 = 1 -> m2 = -2 (but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1,0,1. So that's impossible.

Wait, so the only possible (m1, m2) combinations are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Because 1 + (-2) is impossible, so yeah, only those two.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. So in the uncoupled basis, it's a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how are these combined? I think the coupled state is built from these. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here. The state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is expressed in terms of |m1, m2> states with m1 + m2 = m.

So the expansion would be something like:

|1,1,2,-1> = a * |m1=-1, m2=0> + b * |m1=0, m2=-1>

What are the coefficients a and b? For l=2, m=-1, the CG coefficients can be looked up. I recall that for l1=l2=1, the coefficients for |l=2, m=-2> would be |1, -1> and | -1, 1> maybe. Let me think about the general case.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for two l=1 adding to l=2, m=-1 is given by:

The general formula for m = m1 + m2.

Wait, for l=2, m = 2: only m1=1, m2=1 is possible. For m=1, possible m1=1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=1. For m=0, m1=1, m2=-1; m1=0, m2=0; m1=-1, m2=1. For m=-1, m1=0, m2=-1; m1=-1, m2=0. And for m=-2, m1=-1, m2=-1.

But in our case, m=-1. So the state is a combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>.

The coefficients for these can be found in CG tables. The coefficient for m= -1, l=2, from two l=1's.

From what I remember, for each m, the CG coefficient is sqrt( (2l +1) ) * some factor.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the normalization. Let's say the state is equally a combination of the two terms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L^2 and Lz, where Lz is L1z + L2z.

So when we express this in terms of the individual m1 and m2, it's a sum of all possible |m1, m2> with m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The coefficients can be found using CG coefficients. Let me think about the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2.

The CG coefficients for l=2 and m=-1 would be:

Let me think, the general formula is:

|l1, l2, l, m> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | l, m> ] |m1, m2>

Where <m1, m2 | l, m> is the CG coefficient.

Looking up the CG coefficient for l=2, m=-1, coming from l1=1, l2=1. The CG coefficient for this case would be:

sqrt( ( (2 - m1) (2 + m1 + 1) ) / ( (2l +1) ) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I recall that for two spin-1 particles (since l=1), the CG coefficients for l=2 and specific m's are known.

Wait, from standard CG tables, for l1=1, l2=1:

The state |l=2, m=0> is (|1,-1> + | -1,1> ) / sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the specific CG coefficients for l=2, m=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>, with coefficients perhaps (1/sqrt(2)) each.

Wait, but I think the coefficients for m=-1, l=2 are sqrt( ( (2 +1 - m) (2 +1 + m) ) / something )... Hmm, not sure. Wait, another approach: the state |l=2, m=-1> can be written as a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

The CG coefficients are given by:

< m1, m2 | l, m > = sqrt( ( (2l +1) (l - m1 + m2)! (l + m1 - m2)! ) / ( (l + m1 + m2)! (l - m1 - m2)! ) ) ) ) * something?

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the state being normalized. Let me consider that the state |1,1,2,-1> is a sum of two terms: |0,-1> and |-1,0>, each multiplied by some coefficients a and b.

So the state is a |0,-1> + b |-1,0>.

Now, the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Also, the state must be an eigenstate of L^2 with eigenvalue ħ² l(l+1) = ħ² (2)(3) = 6 ħ².

But I'm not sure how to find a and b from this; perhaps another approach. Alternatively, I can recall that for two spin-1 particles, the CG coefficients for |2,-1> are 1/sqrt(2) for both terms. Because in some cases, for symmetric and antisymmetric states, the coefficients are equal.

Wait, another thought: in the case of two spin-1 particles, the state |2, m=-1> is a combination of |0,-1> and |-1,0> with equal coefficients, each 1/sqrt(2). Because when you add the states, you get a symmetric combination.

Wait, but let me see: the state |1,1,2,-1> is a symmetric state under exchange of particles? Because for two identical particles like electrons, which are fermions, the total state must be antisymmetric under exchange. Wait, but wait, this is about orbital angular momentum, not spin. So perhaps it doesn't matter here. The question says to ignore the spin angular momentum, so maybe this is just about the orbital part.

Wait, no, the electrons are identical particles, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But the question says to ignore spin, so perhaps the orbital part can be considered separately. Hmm, but maybe that's complicating things. Let me focus on the problem at hand.

So, assuming that the state is an equal combination, with a = b = 1/sqrt(2). So when you measure L1z and L2z, each giving -ħ, you're looking for the probability that both m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But wait, earlier, I thought that the only possible (m1, m2) pairs in the state |1,1,2,-1> are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Because m1 + m2 must be -1, and each m can be -1, 0, +1.

So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). So the state is a combination of these two.

So if I were to measure L1z and L2z, what are the possible outcomes?

In the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible individual m1 and m2 are:

Case 1: m1 = -1, m2 = 0. Then L1z = -ħ, L2z = 0ħ.

Case 2: m1 = 0, m2 = -1. Then L1z = 0ħ, L2z = -ħ.

So when these two possibilities are present, is there any scenario where both L1z and L2z are -ħ? Because that would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which gives m_total = -2. But our state is for m_total = -1, so that's not possible.

In other words, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a superposition of states where either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. It does not include the state where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because in that case, m_total would be -2, which doesn't match the state's m of -1.

So, the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero, because the state doesn't include that possibility.

Wait, but wait. Am I sure that the state doesn't include any component where m1=-1 and m2=-1? Because the state's m is -1, any component must have m1 + m2 = -1. So if m1=-1, m2 must be 0. If m1=0, m2 must be -1. If m1=1, m2 would have to be -2, which is impossible because l2=1, so m2 can't be -2.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't have any component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ is zero.

So the correct answer should be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, with their coupled angular momentum state given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the total $z$-component of angular momentum. The question asks for the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for both electrons.

For angular momentum, the eigenvalues of $L_{z}$ are $m\hbar$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. Measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, the total $z$-component of angular momentum is $m = m_1 + m_2$. In this case, $m = -1$, so $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy this condition are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

The state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ is a superposition of these two possibilities. Specifically, it is a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle$ and $|m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle$. Importantly, there is no component in the state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, as this would result in $m = -2$, which does not match the given $m = -1$.

Since the state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not include any contribution from the $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$ configuration, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.
