Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the peak wavelength is the same for both? That's interesting.

Also, their radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, right? So if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, does that mean their observed peak wavelengths are the same, or their intrinsic (rest) wavelengths are the same?

I think it's the observed wavelengths because the radial velocities are given. So if their intrinsic (rest) wavelengths are the same, but due to Doppler shift, their observed might be different. But the problem says the observed are same, so that might tie into the velocities.

Wait, but the problem says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So, the observed wavelengths are the same. So, despite their velocities, the observed peak is the same. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So
