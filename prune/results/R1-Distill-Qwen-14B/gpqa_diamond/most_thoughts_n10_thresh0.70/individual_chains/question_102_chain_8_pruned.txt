Okay, so I have this complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The experiment involves creating a bicistronic vector using lox-Cre technology. The setup is a bit intricate, so I'll need to parse each part carefully.

First, the vector structure: It's bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) in one transcript. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. Between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So, what's the purpose of the stop cassettes? I remember that in Cre/Lox systems, the loxP sites allow for site-specific recombination. The stop cassette probably prevents the translation of the downstream fusion unless Cre is present to excise the stop. LoxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for the Cre enzyme, which can lead to different excision outcomes.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. The upstream of the receptor has an IRES element. Wait, IRES allows internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor can be translated as a separate ORF in a bicistronic mRNA. So, the mRNA would have two coding regions: ligand (with its own promoter) and receptor (with IRES). But the stop cassettes might prevent their expression unless Cre is present.

Next, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development; Cre would be expressed under SOX10's promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So, the Cre should recombine the lox sites in those cells.

Looking at the Western blot: They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, so the loading was correct. But when they bred the mice and crossed with SOX10-Cre, the offspring didn't show a green signal under confocal. The green is from eGFP, which is on the receptor construct.

So why no green signal? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. Not sure how this relates to the expression of the constructs. Maybe if they are secreted and act on other cells, but the question is about expression in the same cells. Not sure if this explains the lack of eGFP.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the receptor isn't trafficked properly, eGFP wouldn't be visible. But why would that happen now? The construct should be correctly processed. Unless the frame is wrong, but that's another option.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The CBA promoter should drive the ligand, and IRES for receptor. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the promoters aren't active. But the problem arises in the mouse model, not in the initial transfection. Since the Western blot showed expression, perhaps the promoters are working. But wait, in the initial blot, they transfected into astrocytes. The mouse model might have a different regulatory context. Not sure.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, right! If the stop cassette isn't correctly excised, the receptor and eGFP might be translated as a single ORF, leading to a frameshift. But how does Cre affect this?

Looking back: The ligand is after the CBA promoter. The loxP-stop-loxP is between ligand and mCherry. The receptor is after an IRES, and the lox2272-stop-lox2272 is between receptor and eGFP.

Wait, in the Cre mouse, the Cre is expressed under SOX10. So, in neural crest cells, Cre would recombine the lox sites. Let me think about each cassette.

For the ligand: The loxP is upstream. So, Cre would excise the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would have their stop cassette (lox2272) in between, which Cre would excise, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be translated.

But wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites. Cre can recognize both, but perhaps in a different way. Oh, wait, lox2272 is a variant that can allow for recombination but might not be recognized by all Cre variants. Or perhaps, in the setup, the loxP and lox2272 are in a way that requires specific Cre activity.

Wait, the vector is set up as: CBA promoter -> ligand, then loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. And for the receptor, it's IRES-receptor, then lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP.

So, when Cre is active,
