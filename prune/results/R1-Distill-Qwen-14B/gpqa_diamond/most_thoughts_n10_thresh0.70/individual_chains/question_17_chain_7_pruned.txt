Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is present. The concentration given is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25 °C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant, Kf, is given here as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is very stable.

Wait, wait. Wait, the K given is K_Ca-EDTA. Oh right, Kf is the formation constant. So the formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in a solution where the complex is present stochiometrically, that means the concentration of the complex is the same as the sum of the free metal ions and the ligand. Because each complex has one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait no, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the solution has no free Ca²+ or EDTA? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. In a solution
