Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the question says that there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal with temperature at 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so the formula would probably be CaY²- where Y is the EDTA part. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact stoichiometry. Oh, right, each EDTA molecule can bind one metal ion, so the complex is 1:1.

The problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So the solution has the CaY²- complex, and we need to find the [Ca²+] when some of it dissociates. 

I recall that the formation constant (Kf) for a complex is given by Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Since the solution is 0.02 M in CaY²-, that's the concentration of the complex. But wait, in solution, some of the complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. 

Wait, but the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution, which probably means that initially, the concentration is 0.02 M CaY²-, and that's it. So the total concentration of Ca and EDTA species would be 0.02 M each? Or wait, no, because the complex is 1:1, so [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA. So the total concentration of Ca species (free Ca²+ plus complex) and EDTA species (free EDTA and complex) should each add up to 0.02 M? Or am I mixing that up?

Wait, no, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the sum of the concentrations of all species related to Ca would be 0.02 M. Because
