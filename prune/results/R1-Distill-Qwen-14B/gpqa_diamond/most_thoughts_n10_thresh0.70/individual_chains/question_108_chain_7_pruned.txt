Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman effect term) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is under a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and m is small. The magnetic field strength is 1 Tesla, and the wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. The options compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (⟨H⟩) with ΔE.

Hmm. I remember that the Zeeman effect deals with the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. For hydrogen, the energy levels split into m levels, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can be -1, 0, +1 for a particular orbital angular momentum. Since m is small here, maybe we're dealing with a situation where m is 1 or -1, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects it.

Wait, the question says "small values of m"—so maybe m is like 1, but perhaps the values are small in magnitude. So the paramagnetic coupling term would be proportional to m times some constants. Let me think about the formula for the Zeeman energy.

I think the Zeeman energy is given by E_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For orbital magnetism, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L), and the z-component would be μ_z = μ * m. Wait, more accurately, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, so the energy shift is E = -μ·B = -μ_z * B. So for orbital Zeeman effect, the energy shift is E_Z = (μ_B) * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, wait, the formula might be E = μ_B * m * B, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the signs, but the magnitude is what matters here.

So the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩, which is E_Z, would be proportional to m * B. But m can be 0, ±1, ±2, etc., but since m is small, let's say m is 1. So ⟨H⟩ ≈ μ_B * m * B.

Then, the transition energy ΔE refers to the energy difference between two hydrogen states. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the wavelength of the Balmer series for hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line, which transitions from n=2 to n=1? Wait, no, H-alpha is actually n=3 to n=2. Oh right, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2, so H-alpha is n=3→2. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm, which matches H-alpha.

The energy of a photon is given by ΔE = hc/λ. So we can calculate ΔE as hc divided by the given wavelength.

So let's compute both values numerically to compare their magnitudes.

First, let me recall the
