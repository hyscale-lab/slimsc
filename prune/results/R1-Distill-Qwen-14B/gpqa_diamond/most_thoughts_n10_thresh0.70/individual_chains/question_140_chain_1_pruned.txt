Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit lost but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what I can figure out.

The problem says Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 atoms of oxygen. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about Substance X. It's reacting with a liquid, Y. What liquids react violently with compounds? Maybe something like water? Or perhaps another solvent. Wait, but the reaction is violent, so maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid. Oh wait, wait. Substances that react violently when in contact with certain liquids... like maybe a strong base or acid, or a metal reacting with water?

But X is known for having a heavier isotope, so perhaps X is a diatomic element with isotopes. Let me think. Which elements are diatomic and have common isotopes?

Well, let me think about possible candidates. For example, hydrogen has isotopes like deuterium. But I don't think that's it. What else? Maybe chlorine, since it's Cl2 and has isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or maybe something else.

Wait, the problem says that the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids have a ketone group, so maybe something like acetic acid is a keto acid. Wait, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. Oh wait, wait. A keto acid is an acid where the carbonyl is a ketone, not a carboxylic acid. So, like something like acetoacetic acid, but that's more complicated.

Wait, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe X is something that adds oxygen, or maybe it's a dehydrating agent. Or perhaps X is a strong base that reacts with the acid.

Wait, another thought. If X is something like phosphorus, which has a heavier isotope. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back. Let's think about gas W. The molecule of W has equal numbers of
