Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X has isotopes, meaning it's an element with varying atomic masses. So probably, X is an element that commonly has isotopes, like chlorine or something else similar.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, each molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. That's interesting. Because protons and neutrons have nearly the same mass, but for a molecule, the total would depend on the element.

Wait, but when it says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, I'm thinking that each molecule must have a certain structure. Let's think about possible gases that fit this.

Another reaction detail: a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point of around 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so solid B melts just above freezing point. What substance has a melting point close to that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a common solid, like ice? But ice's melting point is 273 K, so 277 is
