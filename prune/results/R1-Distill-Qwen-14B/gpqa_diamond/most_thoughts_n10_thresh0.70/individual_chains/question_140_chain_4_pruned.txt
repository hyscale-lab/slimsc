Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 

Another part mentions that the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's tackle this piece by piece.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W and precipitate G. Gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. That suggests W is H2O? Wait, no, because H and O have different numbers. Wait, maybe CO? No, because CO has 6 protons and 8 neutrons in the molecule (each CO molecule has one C and one O). Wait, but that's 6 protons and 8 neutrons in total? Or per atom? Wait, the molecule as a whole. So the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons in the molecule.

Wait, let's think. For example, if the molecule is like CH4, that's 6 protons and 12 neutrons (C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons; H has 1 each). No, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is O2? O has 8 protons, and each O atom has 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons (2 atoms × 8) and 16 neutrons (2 × 8), so 16 each. That fits. But wait, O2 is a gas, but when X reacts with Y, like perhaps an acid or base, maybe it's CO2? No, wait, CO2 has 22 protons (12 from C, 16×2 from O) and 22 neutrons (12 + 16×2=44, wait no, wait, that's the total for each O? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe
