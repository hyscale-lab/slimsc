Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out.

The question gives six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to different groups. They're all undergoing bromination, and I need to arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are in order from least to most para-isomer yield.

Wait, so each of these substituents will direct the incoming bromine either ortho, meta, or para. Also, some groups are activating, others deactivating. Activating groups make the ring more reactive, but more importantly, they can direct the incoming electrophile.

Let me list the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So in bromination, the Br will add more in para and ortho positions.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: This looks like a benzoyloxy group, so it's an ester. The ester group is a meta-directing, deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So para substitution would be less favored here.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So it directs to ortho and para, but the ring is less reactive because of the deactivation.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong meta-directing, deactivating group. So the Br would go mainly to the meta position, which in benzene terms is the same as the meta position relative to the nitro group. Wait, but for para substitution, does nitro allow any? I think nitro is meta-directing, so para is not a major product. So para substitution would be minimal here.

5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. So similar to toluene, more para and ortho.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. The COOH group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So Br would go mostly to meta positions, meaning para would be less likely.

Wait, but wait. For each substituent, the para isomer's yield depends on the directing effect. So for each compound, I need to determine how much para product is formed, and then arrange them from least to most.

So let me think about each substituent's directing effect and whether para is a major product.

1) Toluene (methyl): It's an activating, ortho/para director. So in bromination, para is a major product. So the para isomer should be high. But wait, bromine is a strong electrophile, and for toluene, para is more than ortho because of steric hindrance? Or maybe it's the opposite. I think in the case of toluene, the para isomer is major compared to ortho because orth
