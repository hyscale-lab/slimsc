Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

So the question is: A Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are given as A to D, each with two values, I think each pair is for the mu and neutrino.

The rest masses are given. Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but in particle physics, sometimes they're considered massless for simplicity, especially in such problems. So I guess the neutrino's rest mass is negligible here.

Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the mu and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta so that their total is zero. So momentum conservation tells me that p_mu = p_nu but in opposite directions. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum (because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2, and m is zero). Hmm, but wait, neutrinos do have some mass, but in this case, maybe we're told to treat it as massless? I'm not sure, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's mass is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem ignores the neutrino's mass because it's too small. So, let me proceed with that.

Let me think about energy and momentum conservation.

The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Momentum conservation: the pion is at rest, so the momenta must be equal and opposite. So p_mu = -p_nu. The magnitudes must be the same.

The muon has rest mass, so its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). And the neutrino's energy would be E_nu = p_nu c (since m_nu ~ 0, so E = pc). But since p_mu = p_nu (magnitude), let's let p = p_mu. So E_nu = p c.

So substituting, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) = sqrt( p² c² + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.

Wait, but I'm using units where c is 1, because the rest mass is given in MeV/c². So perhaps I can ignore the c factors in the equations.

Let me write the equations again, in units where c=1.

Total energy: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

Momentum: p_mu = p_nu (since their directions are opposite, but magnitudes same). So p_mu = p_nu.

E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² + m_mu² ) = sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ).

E_nu = p, because m_nu is zero.

So E_mu + p = 139.6.

That gives me one equation.

But I have two variables here: E_mu and p. Wait, no. Because E_mu is expressed in terms of p. So substituting E_mu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2), into the energy equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p.

Let me denote sqrt(p² + a²) as s, where a = 105.7.

So s + p = 139.6.

s = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides:

s² = (139.6 - p)^2.

But s² = p² + a².

So substitute:

p² + a² = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p².

So,

p² + a² = (139.6)^2 - 279.2 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

a² = (139.6)^2 - 279.2 p.

Rearranging,

279.2 p = (139.6)^2 - a².

Calculate 139.6 squared: 139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute that.

Well, 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 140 - 0.4, so (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

So (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 MeV².

a² is (105.7)^2 = approximately 11172.49 MeV².

So,

279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49 is 8315.67?

Wait,

19488.16
-11172.49
------------
= 8315.67, yes.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is just a bit more than 8315.67.

So 279.2 * 29.77 ≈ 8315.

Wait, let's compute 279.2 * 29.75.

29.75 * 279.2:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 * 0.25 = 69.8.

So 8376 - 69.8 = 8306.2 ≈ 8306.2.

But we have 8315.67, which is 9.47 higher than 8306.2.

So 279.2 * x = 9.47, where x is the additional beyond 29.75.

x = 9.47 / 279.2 ≈ 0.034.

So total p ≈ 29.75 + 0.034 ≈ 29.784 ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me think: 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

Wait, no, that's not right. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * (30-1) = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

Wait, but 279.2 * 29.784 ≈ ~8315.67.

Wait, maybe I should just do 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, perhaps I can approximate this.

279.2 ≈ 280.

8315.67 / 280 ≈ 29.7 (since 280 *30=8400, which is 8400-8315.67=84.33 less than 30. So 30 - (84.33/280) ≈ 30 - 0.301 ≈ 29.699.)

So approximately 29.7 MeV/c.

But let's be precise. Let me compute 279.2 × 29.78.

279.2 *29 = 8096.8

279.2 *0.78 = let's compute 279.2 *0.7 = 195.44, 279.2 *0.08=22.336. So total 195.44+22.336=217.776.

So 8096.8 + 217.776 = 8314.576. Close to 8315.67.

So 29.78 gives about 8314.576, which is about 1.094 less than 8315.67.

So how much more do I need to add to 29.78 to get the rest?

Each 0.01 in p adds 279.2 × 0.01 = 2.792 to the product.

We need 1.094 more.

So 1.094 /2.792 ≈ 0.392.

So p ≈ 29.78 + 0.00392 ≈ 29.78392, so approximately 29.784 MeV/c.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV.

The muon's energy E_mu = 139.6 - p ≈ 139.6 -29.784 = 109.816 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV/c², so its energy is more than that, which makes sense because it's moving.

The kinetic energy of the muon would be E_mu - m_mu*c² = 109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV.

Similarly, the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu because its rest mass is zero. So 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but that would make the kinetic energy of the muon about 4.12 MeV, and neutrino 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8. That's very close.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, when I did the calculation for (139.6)^2, I assumed 139.6 is in MeV/c², so in units where c=1, the energy is 139.6 MeV.

Wait, but in my earlier steps, I think I might have mixed up units. Let me recheck.

Wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV/c². So its rest energy is 139.6 MeV.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV/c², so its rest energy is 105.7 MeV.

So when I compute E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2), where p_mu is in MeV/c, and m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², but when using units where c=1, the mass term is m_mu^2 c^4?

Wait, perhaps I should be careful with units.

In natural units (c=1), energy (E), mass (m), and momentum (p) are all in units of MeV. Because E² = p² c² + m² c^4, with c=1, E² = p² + m², where m is in MeV/c² multiplied by c² → m² in (MeV)^2.

Wait, yes. So when we have m_mu =105.7 MeV/c², then m_mu^2 c^4 = (105.7)^2 (MeV)^2 (c^4)/(c^4) )= (105.7)^2 (MeV)^2. So in natural units, the equation E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2) is correct.

So the earlier calculations seem okay.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

E_mu = 139.6 - p ≈109.816 MeV.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV ≈4.12 MeV.

KE_nu = E_nu = p ≈29.784 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's likely the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the equation setup. For instance, when I wrote E_nu = p, is that correct?

Yes, because if the neutrino's mass is zero, then E_nu = |p_nu| c. But in units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

Also, since the pion is at rest, the momentum of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite, so p_mu = p_nu.

So I think the setup is correct.

Another sanity check: the sum of kinetic energies should be the total energy minus the sum of rest masses.

Wait, the total rest energy is 139.6 MeV. The sum of rest energies of products is 105.7 + 0 =105.7. So the total energy available for kinetic energy is 139.6 - 105.7 =33.9 MeV.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, KE_mu is about4.12, KE_nu about29.78. Sum is 33.9 MeV. Oh, that's correct.

So that makes sense.

In the options, option D has 4.12 and 29.8, which sum to 33.92, which is exactly the available KE. So that's correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary π⁺ pion into a μ⁺ muon and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as follows:  
- Rest mass of π⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)  
- Neutrino mass is negligible (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)).

### Key Equations
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]  
   Since the pion is stationary, \( E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is initially at rest, so the total momentum after the decay must be zero. This implies:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}
   \]  
   where \( p_{\mu} \) and \( p_{\nu} \) are the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino, respectively.

3. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The energy of the muon is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
   \]  
   where \( p_{\mu} \) is in units of MeV/c, and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \).

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)), its energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = p_{\mu}
   \]

### Solving for Momentum and Kinetic Energy
From energy conservation:  
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi}
\]  
Substituting \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p_{\mu} \):  
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p_{\mu} = m_{\pi}
\]  
Let \( p = p_{\mu} \). Then:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}
\]  
Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p
\]  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2
\]  
Expanding the right-hand side:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2
\]  
Canceling \( p^2 \) from both sides:  
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p
\]  
Solving for \( p \):  
\[
2 m_{\pi} p = m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2
\]  
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}
\]  
Substituting \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):  
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
\]  
Calculating numerically:  
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49
\]  
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

Now, calculate the kinetic energies:  
1. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} - m_{\mu}
   \]  
   Substituting \( p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c \) and \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx \sqrt{886.4 + 11172.49} \approx \sqrt{12058.89} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}
   \]  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**:  
   The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
