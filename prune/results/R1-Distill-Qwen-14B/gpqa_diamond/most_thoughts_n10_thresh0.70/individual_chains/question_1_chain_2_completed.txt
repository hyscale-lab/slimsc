Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. 

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE = E2 - E1. For the two states to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. Because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty might make it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but wait. The uncertainty in the measurement of energy is determined by the time over which the state is observed. So for each state, the uncertainty is based on their own lifetimes. Or perhaps, when you have two states, you're looking at the energy difference and the uncertainty in that difference.

Alternatively, maybe the relevant uncertainty is the sum of the uncertainties? Because the energy difference would have an uncertainty related to the lifetimes of both states. Or no, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE needs to be bigger than the uncertainty that arises from the measurement time. So the measurement time would be the time over which you're observing the system. Wait, but I'm not sure what the measurement time is in this context. The problem statement says the lifetimes are 10^-9 and 10^-8 seconds. So perhaps the time Δt is the longer of the two, or perhaps the maximum of the two lifetimes?

Wait, perhaps the key is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So for each state, the ΔE must be larger than their individual uncertainties.

Wait, but the ΔE is the difference between E2 and E1. Let me think: if ΔE is much larger than the uncertainty in each energy, then you can distinguish the two states.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty of the system, which would be the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, let me think again. The uncertainty in each energy is given by ħ/τ. So for E1, the uncertainty is about 6.56e-7 eV, and for E2, it's about 6.56e-8 eV.

The energy difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both states? Or perhaps the uncertainty of the difference is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, I think when you have two energies, E1 and E2, the uncertainty in the difference (ΔE) would be the sum of the uncertainties of each. Because the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 and in E2 is ΔE2, so the uncertainty in ΔE = E2 - E1 is ΔE1 + ΔE2. 

So the total uncertainty in ΔE is 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 ≈ 7.216e-7 eV. 

Therefore, to clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference must be greater than 7.2e-7 eV. 

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 7.2e-7. So this can't be.

B) 1e-11 eV → Also way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's much larger than 7.2e-7 eV.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Also smaller than 7.2e-7 eV.

So the only option that is larger than 7.2e-7 eV is option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait another thing. The calculation for the uncertainty in each energy is based on the Heisenberg principle. So for each state, the energy E has an uncertainty of approximately ħ/τ. Thus, the energy difference between E2 and E1 would have an uncertainty of approximately the sum of the individual uncertainties, as the measurements are of each E. So yeah, the total uncertainty is about 7.2e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than this uncertainty to be resolved. Thus, the answer is option C, 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is at least \( \hbar / 2 \). Here, the lifetimes (\( \tau \)) of the states serve as the time uncertainty (\( \Delta t \)).

For \( E_1 \) with a lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainty in energy is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with a lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainty in energy is:

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is much less than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is much less than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** Sufficiently large, as it is greater than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** Too small, as it is less than \( 7.216 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it satisfies the condition for clear distinguishability.
