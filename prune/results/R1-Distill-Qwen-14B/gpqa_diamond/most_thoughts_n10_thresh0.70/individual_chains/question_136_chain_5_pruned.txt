Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. 

The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and it's directed radially. So, in spherical coordinates, the field only has a radial component. That's important because it tells me about the symmetry of the problem. Radial direction means the field doesn't have any components in the angular directions (theta or phi), so the field is spherically symmetric.

Now, the problem asks for the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of the sphere. So I need to compute ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV within the sphere. Wait, I remember that there's a theorem related to this—Gauss's Law, perhaps? Oh right, Gauss's theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. So according to Gauss, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · dA) over the surface.

But wait, in this case, the divergence is something I need to compute. Alternatively, I could compute the divergence of f first and then integrate it over the volume. Let me think about which approach is easier.

Since f is radial and depends only on r, I can compute its divergence in spherical coordinates. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only a radial component (A_r) is given by:

∇ · A = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r)

In this case, A_r is f(r) = 1/r². So substituting that in:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) 

Simplify inside the derivative: r² * 1/r² = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇ · f = 0 everywhere except maybe at r=0.

Wait, wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the volume integral of zero would be zero, right? But wait, isn't there a delta function at the origin if the divergence is zero everywhere else? Because for a field that behaves like 1/r², which is similar to the electric field of a dipole, but wait no, wait. Let me think about the electric field.

No, the electric field of a
