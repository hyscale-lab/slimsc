Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see. The problem states that we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. And the options are A to D. 

Wait, so I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But in this case, there are two acids (CH3COOH and HCl) and one base (Ba(OH)2). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it will also dissociate completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate much.

So, the first step is probably to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when acids and bases react, they neutralize each other. The reaction between acids and bases will produce water and possibly some salt. 

Let me write down the moles for each component.

First, for CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Moles = M Ã— V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl:
0.2 M, 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2:
0.3 M, 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So, moles of OH^- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH^-.

Now, the HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes some H+ ions, but since it's weak, maybe I should consider it after the strong acid-base reactions.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, the acids will react first. So I need to find out how much of the H+ is neutralized by the OH^-.

Total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully ionized. CH3COOH is not, so maybe I should first calculate the total H+ from HCl and the acetic acid's contribution.

Wait, perhaps I should do the neutralization first between the H+ and OH^-.

So, the strong acid (HCl) will provide 0.08 moles of H+. The weak acid (CH3COOH) is 0.05 moles, but it's not fully ionized, so it's a bit complicated. Hmm, maybe I should treat the H+ from the weak acid in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to first calculate the total H+ and OH- contributions, then see if there's excess H+ or OH-.

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each
