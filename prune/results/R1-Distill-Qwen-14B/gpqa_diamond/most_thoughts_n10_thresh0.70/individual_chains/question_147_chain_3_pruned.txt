Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let me read it again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with different velocities.

Wait, so this is a particle physics problem. I remember that annihilation processes involve particles and their antiparticles colliding and producing other particles. But wait, the initial particles here are a proton and an antiproton. So when they annihilate, they produce these particles A⁺ and A⁻. 

Wait, the masses are given: mA c² is 300 MeV. I think that refers to the rest mass energy of particle A. So each A⁺ and A⁻ has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c².

The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. But wait, for antiproton, its rest mass is the same as a proton, which is about 938 MeV/c². But if it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate it as non-relativistic? Or perhaps we should use relativistic equations but consider its velocity as small compared to the speed of
