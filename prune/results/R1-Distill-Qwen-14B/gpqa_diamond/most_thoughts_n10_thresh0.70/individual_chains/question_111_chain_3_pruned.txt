Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about completing reactions and selecting the major products considering steric hindrance and product stability. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as the base. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I need to figure out the major products A and B for each reaction, then match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-Ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A.

I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So this likely induces an aldol addition or maybe a Claisen condensation. Wait, but the starting material is a ketone and ethyl acrylate is an ester with an α,β-unsaturated group. Oh, right, this is a Michael addition scenario. Michael addition is where a nucleophile adds to the β position of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl.

In the Michael addition, the enolate of the ketone will attack the α,β-unsaturated ester. But wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1 (so cyclohexanone with substituents). The substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl groups) and position 6 (methyl). Wait, maybe it's better to number the carbons correctly. 2,6-dimethyl suggests that, but the main ketone is at position 1.

So the ketone is at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl). So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where C1 is a carbonyl, C2 has an ethyl and a methyl (so it's a quaternary carbon?), and C6 has a methyl.

Now, when t-BuOK deprotonates the ketone, it will form an enolate. But wait, what positions can the enolate form? The ketone is at C1, so the alpha carbons are C2 and maybe C6? Wait, no. In a cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the carbonyl is at C1, so alpha carbons are C2 and C6. Wait, no, in a six-membered ring, each carbon is numbered in a circle. So, for cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C
