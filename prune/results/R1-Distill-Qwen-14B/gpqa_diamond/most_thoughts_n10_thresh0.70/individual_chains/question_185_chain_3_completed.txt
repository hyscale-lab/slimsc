Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n, where sigma is the Pauli vector and n is a unit vector.

Hmm, right. I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each of which is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product sigma · n would then be a linear combination of these three matrices, each multiplied by the corresponding component of n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum of the squares of its components should be 1. So n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

So H is epsilon multiplied by (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). Now, I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues of this operator. I think the eigenvalues of a matrix involving Pauli matrices can be determined by their properties.

Wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when they're combined like this, what happens? Oh right! The dot product of sigma and n is a Hermitian matrix because sigma matrices are Hermitian and n has real components. So H is Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues are real.

I remember that for any Pauli vector dot product with a unit vector, the resulting matrix has eigenvalues ±1. Let me think. The trace of sigma · n would be zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, right? Because each sigma_i is traceless. So the sum would also be traceless, which makes sense since the eigenvalues are symmetric about zero.

So the eigenvalues of sigma · n must be +1 and -1. Then, when you multiply by epsilon, which is a constant energy scale, the eigenvalues become ±epsilon. Or wait, maybe not. Let me double-check. H is epsilon multiplied by that matrix.

Wait, no. If the matrix sigma · n has eigenvalues ±1, then when you multiply by epsilon, the eigenvalues are ±epsilon. Because if H = epsilon * (sigma · n), then if the original eigenvalues are ±1, when you multiply each by epsilon, you get ±epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B is +epsilon and -epsilon. Option C is ±epsilon hbar /2. Hmm, why would there be an hbar/2 factor?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because I recall that when you have spin-½ particles, the spin matrices are (hbar/2) sigma. So the actual spin operator is S = (hbar/2) sigma. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is just epsilon times sigma · n, without the (hbar/2) factor. So the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon, not involving hbar at all.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's think about this. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by a unit vector. So for the operator sigma · n, its eigenvalues are ±1. Thus, when you have H = epsilon (sigma · n), the eigenvalues would be epsilon*(±1) → ±epsilon.

So the eigenvalues should be +epsilon and -epsilon. Looking at the options, option B is +epsilon and -epsilon. So that's the correct answer.

Another way to think about it: consider the case when n is along the z-axis, so sigma · n is sigma_z. The eigenvalues of sigma_z are +1 and -1. So when you multiply by epsilon, they become +epsilon and -epsilon. So that must be the case regardless of the direction of n because the eigenvalues only depend on the magnitude, and since n is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1.

Wait, but another approach: the general eigenvalue equation is H |psi> = E |psi>. For H = epsilon (n · sigma), which is a 2x2 matrix. The trace is zero, determinant is (epsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 +n_z^2 )) ? Wait, no. Let me compute the determinant of (n · sigma). Since each Pauli matrix has determinant -I, but wait, sigma_x has determinant -1, same for sigma_y and sigma_z. Wait, actually, the determinant of each sigma_i is -1. So the determinant of (n · sigma) is the determinant of (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y +n_z sigma_z). Let me calculate that.

Alternatively, I can compute the square of the matrix (n · sigma). Because each Pauli matrix squared is I, so (sigma_i)^2 = I. Let me compute (n · sigma)^2.

(n · sigma)^2 = [n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y +n_z sigma_z]^2.

Expanding that, each sigma_i squared is I, and cross terms are sigma_i sigma_j where i ≠ j. But sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, where epsilon is the Levi-Civita symbol.

Wait, but when you square the sum, you get sigma_i sigma_i (which is I for each i) plus 2 sigma_i sigma_j (sum over i<j terms). Let me see:

(n · sigma)^2 = n_x^2 sigma_x^2 + n_y^2 sigma_y^2 +n_z^2 sigma_z^2 + 2n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y + 2n_x n_z sigma_x sigma_z + 2n_y n_z sigma_y sigma_z.

Each sigma_i^2 is I, so that's (n_x² +n_y² +n_z²) I. Since n is a unit vector, this is I. The cross terms: sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z, sigma_y sigma_z =i sigma_x, sigma_z sigma_x =i sigma_y. But wait, in the expansion, each cross term is sigma_i sigma_j. So the cross terms are:

2n_x n_y sigma_x sigma_y = 2n_x n_y (i sigma_z)
2n_x n_z sigma_x sigma_z = 2n_x n_z( -i sigma_y) because sigma_x sigma_z = i sigma_y? Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the cross terms.

Wait, the product sigma_i sigma_j is equal to I delta_ij + i epsilon_ijk sigma_k. So when i !=j, sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k. So for each cross term in the expansion, it's 2n_i n_j (i sigma_k), where (i,j,k) are cyclic.

But when you square (n · sigma), the cross terms are 2n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j. So sigma_i sigma_j = i sigma_k epsilon_ijk. So each cross term is 2n_i n_j (i sigma_k epsilon_ijk).

But when you add all the cross terms, the total is 2i [n_x n_y sigma_z (epsilon_x y z) + n_x n_z sigma_y (epsilon_x z y) + n_y n_z sigma_x (epsilon_y z x)}.

But epsilon_ijk is antisymmetric under exchange of indices, so epsilon_xyz = 1, epsilon_xzy =-1, etc.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute (n · sigma)^2. Let me note that (n · sigma) is a 2x2 matrix, so let's compute (n · sigma)^2.

Another approach: since n is a unit vector, the matrix (n · sigma) is a Hermitian matrix with trace zero. So its eigenvalues must be ±1. Because for a 2x2 matrix with trace 0 and determinant (from the product of eigenvalues) = -1 (since 1 * (-1) = -1), so the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Therefore, when we multiply by epsilon, the eigenvalues become ±epsilon.

So, the eigenvalues are ±epsilon, so the correct option is B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the properties of the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The term \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices:  
\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z,
\]  
where \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \) because \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector. Each Pauli matrix (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)) is Hermitian and traceless, and their eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \). The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are also \( \pm 1 \), regardless of the direction of \( \vec{n} \), because the trace of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is zero and its determinant is \(-1\), consistent with eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).

When \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is multiplied by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}) \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \). This result is independent of the specific components of \( \vec{n} \), as the eigenvalues depend only on the magnitude of \( \varepsilon \) and the fact that \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( \pm 1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).
- **Option B**: \( \pm \varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \( \pm \varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because there is no \( \hbar/2 \) factor in the given Hamiltonian.
- **Option D**: \( \pm \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( \pm \varepsilon \). 

Answer: B
