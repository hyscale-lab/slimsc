Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars' luminosities. Hmm, I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. The question mentions two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me read the details again.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh right, the radius matters because the surface area affects luminosity. Radius squared, I think. So if one is 1.5 times bigger, surface area is (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times. But wait, that's just radius. What else affects luminosity?

Also, the mass is 1.5 times larger for Star_1. Oh, but wait, the problem later says we should assume the stars radiate as black bodies. Oh right, so the luminosity formula for a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. So mass might not directly come into play here unless it's related to temperature. Hmm.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, that implies they have the same temperature. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but does that mean their temperatures are the same? If so, then the luminosity only depends on radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power. Since T is the same, L is proportional to R².

But wait, the problem says that they found the same wavelengths where they appeared brightest, so their peak emission is the same. So yes, same temperature, same T.

But wait, no, that's not the case. Oh, wait no— no, the problem says the wavelengths are the same. So λ_max same implies T same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the peak wavelength is found from the star's spectrum, which depends on the star's temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures are same. So T1 = T2.

So then, luminosity L = 4πR²σT⁴.

Since R1 is 1.5 R
