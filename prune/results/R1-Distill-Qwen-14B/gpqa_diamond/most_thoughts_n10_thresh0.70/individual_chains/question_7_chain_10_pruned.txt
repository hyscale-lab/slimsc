Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. 

I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their lifetime is determined by the probability of this interaction happening. So, the process in question is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. This interaction is probably via the inverse Compton scattering or maybe something else, but wait, inverse Compton is when a low-energy photon gets blueshifted by a high-energy electron. Oh wait, but in this case, it's gamma gamma to electron-positron. So that's a different process, maybe photon-photon annihilation. 

I think the general approach here is to calculate the mean free path of the gamma-ray. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. The lifetime is related to the mean free path divided by the expansion rate of the universe, or something like that. But perhaps for this problem, it's about the interaction cross-section and the number density of CMB photons.

Right, the cross-section for this process (gamma gamma → e+ e-) is probably known. Wait, I think the cross-section for this reaction is given by the inverse of the square of the Compton wavelength or something involving the photon energy. Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs depends on the photon energies.

Wait, from what I remember, the cross-section σ for γγ → e+ e- is roughly proportional to (E_γ * E_photon) / m_e^2, but I'm not entirely sure. Or wait, maybe it's a function that peaks when the combined energy is around twice the electron mass. Wait, the threshold for e+ e- production is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c². So, the minimum energy required for the reaction to happen is when E_γ + E_photon ≥ 2 m_e c². Since E_photon is 1e-3 eV, which is way smaller than m_e c² (about 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV). So the energy of the gamma-ray must be at least around 5e5 eV minus 1e-3 eV, but since 1e-3 is negligible, the gamma needs to be at least about 5e5 eV to have the reaction possible.

But wait, the problem is about the lifetime being limited, which is when the interaction probability is significant. So, the mean free time τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ, which is n σ v, where n is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity. 

Wait, the interaction rate Γ is n σ v. The mean free time is τ = 1/Γ. So, the lifetime of the gamma-ray is limited if τ is comparable to the age of the universe. So, for the gamma-ray to
