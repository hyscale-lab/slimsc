Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's orbit. The bigger the Doppler shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the shifts in their spectral lines are different. Planet #1's shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, right? The formula for that semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( ... ) Hmm, maybe I should think about the simplified version. Since the planets' masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun, we can approximate M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular.

So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*²)^(1/3) * (1 / a)^(1/2) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (P * (1 day) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination angle (but if both are similar, maybe it's the same), the orbital period, and the mass of the star. Since both stars are similar to the Sun, their masses are the same. The planets' masses are similar to Neptune, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So the inclination might not be the same, but the question probably assumes they are edge-on or same, as otherwise the data wouldn't be given.

Wait, but the question says both planets have similar masses, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)²^(1/3) ) * (1 / a)^(1/2)?

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*^2 (1 - e²) )^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since e=0 and sin i is 1
