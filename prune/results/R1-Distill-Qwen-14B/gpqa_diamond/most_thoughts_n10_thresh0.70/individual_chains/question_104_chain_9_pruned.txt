Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's presence.

The question says that two stars with exactly the same mass are each hosting a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detected Doppler shifts are 5 milliangstroms for Planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for Planet #2. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, so the key here is understanding the relationship between the Doppler shift (which relates to the velocity of the star) and the orbital period. I remember that the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, among other things.

The formula for the semi-amplitude (K) of the radial velocity is given by:
K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (something with the orbital distance and such?)

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula more accurately. I think the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass (Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the equation simplifies.

Alternatively, another version I remember is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) c )

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula correctly. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2π) ) / ( c * P ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to look at the proportionality. Since the two stars are identical (same mass), and the planets have similar masses, perhaps we can ignore the planet masses in the denominator because M_p << M_star. So K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, maybe even more directly: K is proportional to ( (M_p) ) / ( M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, I think I should think of it in terms of K being proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) ), given that other factors are constants, like G and c.

Alternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to consider that for the same star mass, the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period
