Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me the volumes and molarities of HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve an acid reacting with a base to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ), and for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy of neutralization is pretty standard, around -57 kJ/mol or something like that. Wait, wait, but I think it's often given as about -36 kJ per mole of H+ because each mole of acid contributes a mole of H+.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out how much H+ and OH- ions are present in each solution because the neutralization depends on the moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each substance.

First, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. So moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions. However, I think in dilute solutions, it's usually fully dissociated. So H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole gives two moles of H+.

The volume here is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives 2 H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

Volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. Moles = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when you mix acid and base, the H+ and OH- will react. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent is determined by the moles of H+ and OH-.

Let's sum up all the H+ from the acids. HCl gives 0.1 mol, H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol. So total H+ is 0.28 mol.

The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 mol.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- will proceed until one of them runs out. Let's see:

H+ available: 0.28 mol
OH- available: 0.2 mol

So OH- is the limiting reagent because 0.2 < 0.28. That means all 0.2 mol of OH- will react, and 0.08 mol of H+ will remain unreacted.

Wait, no—that's not right. Wait, because the total H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So all the OH- will be used up, and the excess H+ will be 0.08.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 mol, same as the OH-.

But wait, the problem is about neutralization enthalpy. I think the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ reacting. So for each mole of H+ neutralized by OH-, you get a certain amount of energy change.

So the total enthalpy change would be the moles of H+ that reacted multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

But wait, some sources might say that the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid, but that's not the case here because we're mixing different acids and a base. So perhaps it's better to go by the moles of H+ and OH-.

Another approach: the total reaction is between all the acids and the base. So the total H+ from all acids is 0.28 mol, and the OH- is 0.2 mol.

So when they react, 0.2 mol of H+ will react with 0.2 mol of OH- to form water. The remaining 0.08 mol of H+ will not react, so the solution will be acidic, but the neutralization only accounts for the 0.2 mol.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it's providing 0.2 mol of OH-.

So the heat released would be the moles of H+ reacting (0.2 mol) multiplied by the enthalpy per mole of H+ neutralization.

Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). Alternatively, sometimes it's given per mole of H2O formed, but I think it's more common to express it per mole of H+.

Wait, let me check my notes. The standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), because each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH- to form a mole of water, releasing about 57 kJ.

Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as -57 kJ per mole of acid, but that's only when the acid provides one H+.

So in this case, the total moles of H+ reacting are 0.2 mol. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me look at the options.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but my calculation gives -11.4 kJ. So wait, if 57 kJ is per mole, but the problem asks for the enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole of reaction (H+ + OH- → H2O), which is 57 kJ per mole.

Wait, wait, but I'm getting confused. Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 57 /4.184 ≈13.6). So if I have 0.2 moles, 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ = about 2.72 kcal. Wait, no, wait: 57 kJ is 13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 13.6 kcal = 2.72 kcal. But wait, the enthalpy is negative because it's exothermic. So the total would be -2.72 kcal. That's option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought 0.2 moles × 57 kJ would be 11.4 kJ, which is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 kJ ≈ 2.72 kcal because 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

But that would make the answer A) -2.72 kcal. But wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem is mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Let me recalculate each component's H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So when reacting H+ and OH-, 0.2 moles of each will react (since OH- is the limiting reagent).

So the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2, and each mole gives off 57 kJ. So 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as 11.4 kJ because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. Wait, no, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J.

So 11400 J /4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is approx 2.72 kcal.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about 47.7 kJ (11.42 kcal ×4.184 ≈47.7 kJ). That's much higher than my calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is given as per mole of acid, regardless of the H+ ions. For strong monoprotic acids, it's about -57 kJ per mole of acid. But for H2SO4, which is diprotic, each mole gives two H+, so maybe the enthalpy is double? Or is it the same because each H+ contributes?

Wait, no, the enthalpy is per mole of H+ neutralized. So each mole of H+ contributes about -57 kJ.

So, in our case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, so 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches this calculation.

But wait, the options also include D) -16.0 kJ, which is about -3.84 kcal. Because 16,000 J is about 3.84 kcal.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and contributes two OH- per mole. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, so each OH- requires one H+. But in this case, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ are used, leaving 0.08.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles, so 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is much higher. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me see: 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J, which is 11,400 /4184 ≈2.72 kcal. So the correct answer would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another point. I think the molarity of H2SO4 is 0.3 M. So 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

But H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in dilute solutions, it's fully dissociated. So that's correct.

So putting it all together, the total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol reacted, releasing 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That would be if 0.28 mol of H+ reacted, but that's not possible because OH- is only 0.2. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, let me double-check:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L =0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So correct.

So the H+ is 0.28, OH- 0.2. So 0.2 reacts, 0.08 H+ left.

So enthalpy is 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ=2.72 kcal.

So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another thought: The problem says the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of acid (like per mole of H+?), but in this case, perhaps the calculation is done per mole of H2O formed.

Each mole of H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H2O releases 57 kJ. So if 0.2 moles of H2O are formed, the enthalpy is 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

Which is 2.72 kcal.

So the answer is A.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ. So that would be if 0.84 moles of H+ reacted. But that's not the case. So I think I'm confident that the correct answer is A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available.

1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so total H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a strong, diprotic acid and fully dissociates.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Reaction Between H⁺ and OH⁻**:  
   The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   Total H⁺ available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, so only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ to form \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O.

5. **Enthalpy of Neutralization**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
   Total enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   Converting to kcal (\( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ} \)):  
   \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A) -2.72 kcal**: Matches the calculated value.  
   - **B) -11.42 kcal**: This corresponds to approximately \( 47.7 \, \text{kJ} \), which is inconsistent with the calculation.  
   - **C) -3.80 kcal**: This is incorrect and does not match the calculation.  
   - **D) -16.0 kJ**: This is approximately \( -3.84 \, \text{kcal} \), which is also inconsistent with the calculation.

The correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A
