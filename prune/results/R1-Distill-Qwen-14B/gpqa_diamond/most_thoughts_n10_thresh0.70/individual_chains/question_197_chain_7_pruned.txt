Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully. 

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used in the hydroxymercuration or maybe in some substitution reactions. Wait, no, wait, I think it's used in the Clemmensen reduction or maybe the Wolff-Kishner? Wait, no, actually red phosphorus is involved in the hydroboration-oxidation maybe? Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, I think it's more likely for deoxygenation reactions. Oh wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI is part of the oxymercuration or maybe the mercapto group substitution. Hmm, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used in the reaction called the deoxygenative cleavage of epoxides, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving elimination or substitution. Wait, perhaps it's related to the formation of alkenes from alcohols. Oh wait! Oh right, the reaction of an alcohol with HI and red phosphorus is the typical way to perform a substitution reaction, maybe like converting an alcohol to an iodide. Oh wait, but red phosphorus usually is a catalyst in such substitutions. Let me think: when an alcohol reacts with HI in presence of red phosphorus, it
