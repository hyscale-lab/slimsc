Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then seeing what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, all involving substituted benzene rings with various substituents.

First, I need to analyze the spectroscopic data given. Let's start with the IR. The IR spectrum has peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates stretches like O-H or N-H. The region from 3400 to about 2500 is where O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) would show up as broad peaks. So, maybe there's an -OH group here. Then there's 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 3400 region is a broad peak, which is typical for O-H in carboxylic acids. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid?

Then, the IR also has peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. These are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring, like benzene, with substituents.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. Let me jot down the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Could this be an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm but split into doublets often. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton would be around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak, which matches. So this is likely the -COOH proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. In aromatic regions, this suggests two equivalent protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene, like two protons on one side as a doublet. So, like in p-xylene, where two protons are ortho to a substituent, giving a doublet.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also two protons as a doublet. Wait, that's another set. So, perhaps two doublets in the aromatic region. Like in a para-substituted benzene where there are two substituents? Or maybe a meta arrangement? Wait, but if it's a para-substituted ring, maybe there are two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent like a methyl group in the para position, leading to two sets of doublets for the aromatic protons.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say it's a benzene ring with substituents in the para position. For example, if the substituent is a group that's causing the
