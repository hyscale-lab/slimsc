Okay, so I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's see. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. 

Wait, σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that γ matrices are dimensionless, right? Because in QFT, fermion fields like ψ have a certain mass dimension. Let me think about the dimensions of each field and term.

The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four dimensions, so the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me break down each part of the term. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

First, ψ is a spinor field. I think the mass dimension of ψ is 3/2. Because for a Dirac field, ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄, which is the adjoint, also has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 + dimension of σ. But wait, σ is a product of γ matrices, which are dimensionless. Because γ matrices are treated as dimensionless objects in QFT. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

So ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then multiplied by F^{μν}. What's the dimension of F? F is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The gauge field A has dimension 1 (since ∂ has dimension 1, and F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each A has to have dimension 1). F^{μν} is dimension 2, because each derivative is dimension 1, and F is two derivatives.

Putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So the dimensions would be [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]. Wait, no, wait. The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, so each ψ is 3/2, σ is 0, F is 2. So the total for the fields is 3/2 (ψ̄) + 3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) = 3 +2 =5? But wait, wait, that can't be right because the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. So the entire term has to have dimension 4. So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =4.

Wait, no, the term is κ multiplied by the product of fields. So the
