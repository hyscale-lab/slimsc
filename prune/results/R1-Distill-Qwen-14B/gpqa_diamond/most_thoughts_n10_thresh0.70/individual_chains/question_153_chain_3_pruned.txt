Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through carefully.

Hmm, the question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the correct products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). Michael addition usually involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate source. So, in the presence of NaOEt, which is a base, I think the malonate would deprotonate to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester, right? Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it reacts as a nucleophile in a Michael addition, the enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that is likely CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be where the p-tolyl is at the 3 position, so maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? I'm a bit confused. Let me think: Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be substituting at the third carbon, which would be the CH2 group? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, but if it's 3-substituted, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. The acrylate group is CH2=CHCOOCH3. If it's 3-(p-tolyl), then the p-tolyl (a methyl group attached to a phenyl at the para position) is on the third carbon, which is the CH2 part. Wait, perhaps
