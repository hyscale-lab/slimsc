Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I remember that the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester with enolate-forming ability. The other molecule is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be an acrylate with the p-tolyl group on the alpha carbon. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl on carbon 3.

In a Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Wait, so the acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. The enolate (nucleophile) would add to the beta position, so the p-tolyl group is on the gamma carbon relative to the carbonyl.

So when the attack happens, the product would have the malonate group adding onto the acrylate. Let me visualize this: the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C-O-Me (with the CH2 next to the ester being the alpha, and CH is the beta). Oh wait, no, wait. The structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C-O-Me with the p-tolyl on the CH2? No, wait, the substituents are on the double bond. The (E) configuration means the substituents are opposite each other.

Wait, the structure is more accurately CH2=CH-C-O-Me, but with the p-tolyl on the central carbon. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and C3 has the substituents (O-Me from the ester and p-tolyl). So when the enolate attacks the beta position (C2), the addition would form a new bond between the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) and C2, and the other part would be the C3-O-Me and p-tolyl groups.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile. It can form an enolate at the central carbon between the two ester groups. When this attacks the beta carbon (the double bond's less substituted end), the attack would add the malonate group to that position.

So the product would have the structure where the malonate is
