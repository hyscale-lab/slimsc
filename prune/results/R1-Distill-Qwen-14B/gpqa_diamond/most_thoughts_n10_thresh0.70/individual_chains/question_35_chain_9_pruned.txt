Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives the operator A_y as being represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Oh wait, I remember that S here is probably the Pauli matrices. Pauli matrices are a set of 2x2 matrices used in quantum mechanics, right? So S is the Pauli y-matrix, which is usually written as σ_y.

So, let me write down the matrix S. The first row is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Now, the question asks about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Also, which statement among the options is correct.

I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. Eigenvalues of a matrix operator are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Wait, but Ay is c multiplied by S. Since S is a matrix, its eigenvalues are known for Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them has eigenvalues ±1. Since S is σ_y, its eigenvalues should be ±1. So, Ay = c * S has eigenvalues c*(±1), which would be ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the eigenvalues of S are ±i? Wait no, no. The eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1, right. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, which means their eigenvalues are real. So σ_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(+1) and c*(-1), which are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).
