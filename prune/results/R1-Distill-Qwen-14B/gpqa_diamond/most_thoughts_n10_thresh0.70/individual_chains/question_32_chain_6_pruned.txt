Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. Oh right, Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

The question gives four options for the energy: A through D. I need to calculate the correct energy, probably using relativistic equations. 

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the total energy E of a particle is given by the equation E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the first step is to find gamma when v is 0.96c. Let me compute that. Let's see, v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which I think is 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Let me double-check that calculation. Oh yes, because 0.28 times 3.57 is around 1. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. Let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = (96/100)^2 = (9216/10000) = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/(0.28) = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so the mass is that of 6 nucleons. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me calculate that. 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I should be precise. The actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy, but in this context, I think we should use the rest mass as if it were the sum, because for heavy ions in colliders, the mass is often approximated as the sum of the constituent nucleons.

So the rest mass energy m c² is 5.628 GeV.

Then the total energy E is gamma multiplied by that, so E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.628. Let me do this step by step.

First, 3 * 5.628 = 16.884.

Then 0.5714 * 5.628. Let's compute that:

0.5 * 5.628 = 2.814.

0.0714 * 5.628 ≈ 0.0714 * 5.6 is approximately 0.401, and 0.0714 * 0.028 is about 0.002, so total about 0.403. But 0.0714 is approximately 1/14, so 5.628 / 14 is approximately 0.402.

So 0.5714 *5.628 ≈ 2.814 + 0.402 ≈ 3.216.

So adding the two parts: 16.884 + 3.216 = 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, 3.5714 *5.628.

Breaking it down:

5.628 * 3 = 16.884.

5.628 * 0.5 = 2.814.

5.628 * 0.07 = 0.394.

5.628 * 0.0014 = approximately 0.00788.

Adding 0.5 + 0.07 + 0.0014 = 0.5714.

So 2.814 + 0.394 = 3.208, plus 0.00788 is about 3.21588.

So total E is 16.884 + 3.21588 = 20.09988 GeV, approximately 20.10 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419. Hmm, but wait, did I miss anything?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96 c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 )

Compute 0.96^2: 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So yes, that's precise.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the product more accurately.

5.628 GeV * 3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.628 * 3.57142857.

I can write 3.57142857 as 25/7, since 25 ÷ 7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5.628 * (25/7) = (5.628 *25 ) /7.

5.628 multiplied by 25 is 140.7.

So 140.7 /7 = 20.1.

Ah, so that's where the 20.1 comes from. So E ≈20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. But I think perhaps I approximated the mass.

Wait, maybe the miscalculation comes from the mass of the nucleus. Let me check the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is not exactly 6 * 938 MeV/c². Because the binding energy reduces the mass. So perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary for this problem, but let
