Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what I need to do. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh, and X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay, so first I need to figure out what nucleus we're dealing with.

Li is lithium. The standard symbol is Li, and the number of neutrons is given as 3. So, the atomic number of lithium is 3 (since Li is element 3). So the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, probably a deuteron or something else? Wait, no, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so it's a Li-6 ion.

Now, the question is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, so we need to calculate the total energy of the ion when moving at that speed.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let me compute that part first.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, because 0.28 *0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me check: yes, 1/0.28 is about 3.5714.

But wait, actually, let me make sure I calculate it accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So that part is correct.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait another thing: 0.96 is 0.96c, so the expression is correct.

So next, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². But what is the mass of Li-6?

I recall that for a nucleus with mass number A, the mass is approximately A times the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron). A nucleon's mass is about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, A is 6, so m = 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Oh wait, but wait, that's an approximation. In reality, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than A times the individual nucleon masses due to binding energy, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we're supposed to use A * m_nucleon. Or maybe we need the exact mass.

Wait, but wait, Li-6's actual mass is ... let me think. The exact mass of Li-6 is, I think, 6.013 u maybe? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me recall: the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u).

So, converting the mass from u to MeV. I know that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013 u would be 6.013 *
