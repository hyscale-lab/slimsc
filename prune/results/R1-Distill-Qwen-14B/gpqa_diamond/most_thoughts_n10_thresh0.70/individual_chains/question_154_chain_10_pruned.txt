Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's see what I've got here. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. Hmm, I remember that in such cases, the key is to look at the given spectral information and match it to the options provided.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 at 32%. Oh, wait, the molecular ion is usually the highest mass peak. The other peak is at 2 mass units higher. That might indicate something like a chlorine isotope, but wait, chlorine has a natural abundance of about 35% for the 35Cl isotope and about 65% for 37Cl. So if the molecular formula has one chlorine atom, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at m/z = (M) and another at M+2. The ratio would be based on the abundance. So here, M is 156 and M+2 is 158, with a 32% relative intensity. Let me calculate that. The ratio of M to M+2 should be roughly (35Cl)/(37Cl), which is about 35:65, or 0.538. Wait, but the M peak is 100%, so the M+2 should be 35% if the molecule has one Cl. Hmm, but here the M+2 is 32%, which is close enough, maybe considering some rounding or other factors. So that suggests the molecule has one chlorine atom. So the molecular formula likely has a Cl.

Next, looking at the IR data. The IR shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually suggest either an -OH stretch (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or maybe an -NH stretch, but there's no NH in the options. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, or maybe an amide. But the options don't seem to include amides. So looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH groups. So the functional groups would be a carbonyl (from the aldehyde), an OH (phenolic), and Cl.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid with Cl at the para position. So the functional groups are a COOH (carboxylic acid) and Cl.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's O-phenyl chloroformate, which is an acyl chloride. So the functional groups are Cl and an acyl group (O-CO-Cl, perhaps? Wait, no, chloroformate is OCl-CO-O-Ph? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, phenyl chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-Ph, right? So the structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So that's an acyl chloride, which would have a strong C=O peak around 1720 cm^-1, but would the IR show Cl in the 800-900 region? Also, acyl chlorides typically have sharp C=O peaks around 1800, maybe higher. Wait, the given IR is 1720, which is lower than typical for acyl chlorides. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid with Cl at the ortho position. So again, COOH and Cl.

So the IR has a broad peak, which probably indicates an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid (since alcohols can have broad peaks, but so can carboxylic acids). Wait, but 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde has an aldehyde and a phenolic OH. The aldehyde proton in the NMR would be around 9-10 ppm, but looking at the 1H NMR, there's a peak at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). Wait, that's a singlet at 11. Could that be an aldehyde proton? Or maybe a carboxylic acid? Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. Wait, but in the given NMR, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet, 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be broad, but in the options, like B and D, the compounds have COOH groups. But in the NMR, the 11.0 peak is a singlet. Wait, in benzoic acid derivatives, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but in the NMR given, it's a singlet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, the 11.0 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm. Could it be something else? Maybe an acidic proton, perhaps a phenolic OH? Or maybe an amide, but the options don't include that.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 (s, 1H), 8.02 (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). The downfield peak at 11 is probably something deshielded, like a carbonyl group. Wait, but in 1H NMR, the proton signals don't directly correspond to the carbonyl's position. Hmm. So the 11.0 is a singlet, 1H. Maybe it's an aldehyde proton. So then, the 8.02 and 7.72 could be the aromatic protons
