Okay, so I have this question about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. I need to figure out which planet is better to observe based on the given information.

Let me read the question again. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits. The stars' masses are different: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But the stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. 

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / a_orbit, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Oh right, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_planet / R_star) / (a / R_star), but no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, more accurately, the probability P is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ), no, wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s) / (a_p / R_s) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

I think the probability is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_p / R_s )) )? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a_p / R_s )) ), but maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the size of the star. Or more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_p + R_s) / a_p, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximated as R_p / a_p. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I think I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R
