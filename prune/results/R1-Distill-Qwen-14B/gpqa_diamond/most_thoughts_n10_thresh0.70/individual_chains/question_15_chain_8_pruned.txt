Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about determining which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers can prioritize their observations. Let me break down the information given.

First, both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. They were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is P2 = 3 * P1? Wait, no, wait. The question says that Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So, if Planet_2's period is longer, then P1 is shorter. Let me get this right: the period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, P1 = (1/3) * P2. So if Planet_2 has a period of, say, 300 days, Planet_1 would have 100 days.

Both planets have circular orbits, which is good because that might simplify some calculations. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting because more massive stars are usually larger, but here they've evolved a bit. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but both have same radii. So, Mass star1 = 2 * Mass star2. Radius star1 = Radius star2.

We need to find the probability of transit for each planet. Oh, right, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the star and the orbital distance. The formula for the probability of a transit is P = (R_planet / a) * (something?), but I think the exact formula is a bit more involved. Wait, I remember that the probability of a transit is approximately R_p / (a * (1 - e²)^½), where e is the eccentricity. But since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p) / (a), but wait, actually, no. Let me get this right.

Wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a)
