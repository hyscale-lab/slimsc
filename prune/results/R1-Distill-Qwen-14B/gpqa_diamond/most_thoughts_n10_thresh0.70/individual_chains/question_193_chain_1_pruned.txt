Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1/distance (in some unit like parsecs).

Wait, the formula they're giving is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So N is the number of stars, and it depends on the inverse of parallax to the fifth power. Let me think about how to relate this to distance. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5, because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. Wait, no, let me double-check.

Wait, plx = 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So we're probably looking for the differential change, like the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars...change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So maybe it's asking about the
