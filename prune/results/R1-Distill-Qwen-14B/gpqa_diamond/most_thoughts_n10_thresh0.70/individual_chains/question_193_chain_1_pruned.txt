Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, right? So it's like N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Hmm, and the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So I need to relate parallax to distance and then see how N depends on r.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1 / distance in parsecs. So distance d = 1/plx. So if plx increases, distance decreases, and vice versa.

But the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So perhaps I should express N in terms of d instead of plx.

Since N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, substituting that in would give N ∝ d^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the math. So plx = 1/d. So 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if N increases with d^5, then as d increases, N increases rapidly.

But wait, the options are about how the number changes per unit range of distance. Oh wait, no, the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The question might be asking about the number of stars per unit volume, or perhaps the differential number of stars as you move a small distance. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let me think again. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → substituting plx = 1/d → N ∝ d^5.

So if the number of stars is proportional to d^5, then per unit distance, the change would involve the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume? Or per unit distance? Hmm, stars are 3D, so maybe I should consider volume. Let's think
