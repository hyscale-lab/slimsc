Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the index of hydrogen deficiency for a product. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is related to the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Right, the formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. Oh wait, in this case, there's no mention of X or N, so maybe the product doesn't have any halogens or nitrogen.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw that structure mentally. So it's a cyclohexene ring. The numbering is tricky. Let me think: cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so that's attached at position 5.

Wait, the structure is: cyclohexane ring. Positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 2 has a CHO group, position 5 has a CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's attached as CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the ring has a double bond at 3-4, a formyl at 2, and a vinyl at 5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh right, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction or something else? Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI usually lead to the formation of a ylide which can be used in Wittig reactions. Oh wait, no, the Hunsdiecker reaction uses H2O2 and UV light to break down halides, but I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are involved in the deoxygenation of ketones. Oh wait, another reaction: when you have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), reacting with red phosph
