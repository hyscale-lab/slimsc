Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, you get a salt solution which is acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and sodium ions (Na+). Sodium doesn't really affect the pH because it's a spectator ion. So the pH will mainly depend on the acetate ions and the solution's buffer behavior.

Alright, the problem states that 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Oh wait, right, because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and then you add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³.

The initial moles of acetic acid before dilution: Molarity is moles/volume (L). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume becomes 0.04 L, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me find how much NaOH is needed for that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles. Moles of NaOH required = same as moles of acetic acid. So moles = Molarity * Volume. Rearranging, Volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH.

Now, the question asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

First, let's tackle 25% titration. 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at this point, 2.5 mL of NaOH has been added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the solution is now in a buffer, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Which is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733, so pKa is 4.733.

The concentrations here are the moles divided by the total volume. The total volume is original 40 mL plus 2.5 mL NaOH, so 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Hmm, rounding, maybe 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But let me check the other calculations to be sure.

Wait, let's think again about the dilution. Oh wait, did I account for the correct total volume? Because after adding NaOH
