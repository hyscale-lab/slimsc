Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can be tricky. Let's see what the question is. Hmm, we're dealing with acetic acid and NaOH titration. Let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A through D.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. When you mix two solutions, the total volume increases, so the concentration decreases. So the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = 1/40 * 0.05 *20, wait wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with a mole of NaOH.

We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. First, I should find the moles of acetic acid initially present after dilution.

Molarity is moles per liter. The diluted solution is 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added. So that's the amount of acetic acid that's been neutralized. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the amount of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) formed is 0.00025 moles.

The total volume at this point is the initial diluted volume plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but since the problem doesn't specify the volume of NaOH added at 25%, I think I can assume that the volume change is small, but maybe I need to calculate it. Alternatively, sometimes for these calculations, especially when the volumes are similar, they might ignore the added volume, but I'm not sure. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to only consider the initial diluted solution and the moles, but not adjust for the added NaOH volume. Hmm, but in reality, when you add NaOH, you increase the solution's volume, which affects the concentrations.

Wait, but how much NaOH is added at 25% titration
