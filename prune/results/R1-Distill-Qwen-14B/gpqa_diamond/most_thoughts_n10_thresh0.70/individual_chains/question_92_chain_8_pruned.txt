Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic molecule. Hmm, wait, what's the molecule again? Oh right, it's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to remember what enthalpy of formation means. Oh yeah, it's the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, I guess I need to figure out all the bonds formed and broken and use the given bond energies to calculate that.

The problem gives me some bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Oh, and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, atomization is the energy needed to break all bonds in an atom, right? So for carbon, which forms four bonds, the bond energies would sum to 1000 kJ/mol. But wait, how does that fit into the calculation?

I think the approach here is to use the method where we calculate the enthalpy change as the sum of bond energies broken minus the sum of bond energies formed. But since this is the formation from elements, I need to figure out how many of each bond type are in the molecule.

Wait
