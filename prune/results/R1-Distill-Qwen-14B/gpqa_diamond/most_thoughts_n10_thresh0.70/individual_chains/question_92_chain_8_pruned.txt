Okay, I need to calculate the enthalpy of formation for this compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I can use bond energies to approach this.

Wait, the question gives me the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to make it into separate atoms. So for carbon, which is in its standard state, maybe as graphite or diamond? But I don't think that matters here since the value is given.

The compound in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a molecule with multiple double bonds and branching. Let me try to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the formula. The molecular formula will help determine how many C-C, C=C, C-H bonds are present.

Let me write the formula. Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2 group is two CH3 attached to a central C. So each of those has 3 H's. Then there's a C=CH group. So I think the structure is something like:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count all the bonds and then calculate the total bond energy. Then, compare it to the bond energies of the elements in their standard states.

The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the products) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the reactants)

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is: the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from its elements. So, using bond energies, I can calculate it by considering the bonds broken in the reactants (elements) and the bonds formed in the products (the molecule).

Wait, let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for each bond in the compound, I can calculate the energy required to break those bonds and the energy released when forming new bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the atomization approach. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by:

ΔHf
