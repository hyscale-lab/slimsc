Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The problem gives me the density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A to D, each with different r values. Oh right, qubit space is typically represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space with coordinates (x, y, z), right? I think the Bloch sphere comes into play here. So each qubit state can be plotted on a Bloch sphere, and the density matrix describes a mixed state, which would be a point inside the sphere.

Wait, for a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. The Bloch vector for a pure state |ψ⟩ is given by (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation value of the Pauli matrices. For example, |0⟩ would have a Bloch vector at (0,0,1), and |1⟩ would be (0,0,-1), but wait, no—I think |1⟩ is (0,0,-1), yeah. But wait, the density matrix for a pure state |0⟩ is |0⟩⟨0|, which is a projector. So the Bloch vector would be (0,0,1), right?

But this density matrix ρ isn't a pure state. It's a mixed state because it's a sum of two projectors, each multiplied by 1/2. Wait, no, wait, ρ equals (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with probability 1/2. So what does that look like on the Bloch sphere?

I remember that for a mixed state, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). So if I can express the given ρ in this form, I can find r.

Let me write out the given ρ. It's (|0
