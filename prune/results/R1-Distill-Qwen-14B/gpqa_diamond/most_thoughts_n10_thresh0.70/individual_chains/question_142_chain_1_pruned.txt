Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The density matrix given is ρ equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). So, wait, what does that represent? Oh right, a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, in this case, since each term is |0><0| and |1><1|, which are projectors onto the basis states, maybe this is a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>?

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate this. So, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in (2,2) position. So adding them together gives a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Then multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So the matrix is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

But wait, what does this density matrix represent? Oh, right! This is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. It's like a classical mixture where the qubit has equal probability of being in state |0> or |1>, regardless of the measurement basis. Because when you measure it in any basis, the probabilities are 0.5 each.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh, wait, probably referring to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

For a single qubit, the Bloch vector r is represented as (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation value of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be expressed using the Bloch vector as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ represents the Pauli matrices vector.

So, let me see. Given ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|) / 2, let's compute this. Let me write the density matrix again:

|0><0| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]]
|1><1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]
So adding them: [[1,0], [0,1]] divided by 2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

So, substituting into the Bloch representation: (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 = ρ.

So, let's compute each term.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (I + ... )/2 gives the same as our ρ. So,

(I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) must be equal to 2ρ, which is [[1, 0], [0, 1]].

Wait, 2ρ is [[1,0],[0,1]], so the sum I + r·σ = [[1,0],[0,1]].

So, let's compute r·σ. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1
