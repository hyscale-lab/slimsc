Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

Starting with the FTIR. The broad absorption at around 3000 cm-1 is probably an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, another strong peak at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. Sometimes, conjugated carbonyls or amides have lower wavenumbers, but in this case, maybe it's an ester or something else. Wait, another thought: if there's a conjugated carbonyl group, like a conjugated ester or something with a C=C nearby, that might lower the carbonyl peak a bit. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic ring with some substituents?

Looking at the NMR data: There are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. If it's a vinyl group, that suggests there's an alkene somewhere in the structure. Maybe an ester with an alkene nearby, or perhaps a conjugated diene.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. So I need to think about what fragments give a mass of 45. Let me think about common fragments. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is m/z 91, so that's not it. Maybe a ketene fragment? Wait, 45 could be a small fragment like (CH3)2CO, but wait, (CH3)2CO is 58. Hmm, maybe a propyl group or something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be a methyl ester or something similar. Or perhaps a COO group losing something? Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3COO+ (which is 45: 12+16+16 +12+1+16? Wait, wait, no. Wait, molecular weight of CH3COOH is 60. Wait, but the fragment at 45 is likely a smaller group. Let me think: 45 could be (CH3)2O, but that's 45? Wait, no. (CH3)2O is 30 (12*2 + 16 + 3*1*2?) Wait, no, wait. (CH3)2O is 2*12 (C) + 6*1 (H3) + 16 (O) = 24 + 6 +16=46. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, the fragment could be a propyl group with some O. Alternatively, maybe it's a COOCH2 group. Wait, COOCH2 would be (12+16*2 +12 +2*1) =12 +32 +12 +2= 58. No, that's not it.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the possible molecular formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2. Molecular weight is 6*12 +12 +16*2 =72 +12 +32=116 g/mol.

B) C6H10O. 72+10 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2. 72+10+32=114.

D) C6
