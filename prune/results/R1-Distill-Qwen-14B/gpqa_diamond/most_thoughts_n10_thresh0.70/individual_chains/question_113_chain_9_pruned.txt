Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down the data given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, usually around 2500-3300. Also, if there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1, what could those be? The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe an acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or possibly a conjugated system. Oh, wait, sometimes conjugated carbonyls or aromatic rings can lower the carbonyl peak frequency. Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide or an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching), but the question mentions that in the NMR there are vinyl hydrogens, which are protons on a double bond. So maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, or maybe a C=C stretch.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. That means there's probably a double bond somewhere in the molecule, like an alkene group. So that gives me a clue about the structureâ€”like maybe an ester or a ketone with an adjacent double bond.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45 is interesting. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, a fragment with a mass of 45 could be something like (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether, which is 45 g/mol), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group or something else. Wait, another possibility: the m/z 45 could correspond to a fragment that's a ketone or an ester. Let me think about common fragments. 45 is also the molecular weight of C3H7O, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the compound has an ester group, the fragment might break off the carbonyl part.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

So, the molecular formulas vary in the number of oxygen and hydrogen atoms.

Let me consider the degrees of unsat
