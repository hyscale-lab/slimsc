Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, radius same as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so 5000 K perhaps? 

The main point is that when we observe this star, its brightness changes over time because of the rotation, causing the spots to come into and out of view. This could mimic the effect of an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing dips in brightness. The question is, if instead of spots, the variation is due to an exoplanet, what would be the radius of the planet relative to the star to produce the same brightness variation amplitude?

So, the formula I remember for the brightness change when a planet transits a star is that the change in flux, delta F, is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet over the area of the star. Since flux is proportional to area, the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing the variation. The star's brightness isn't uniform because of the spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and out of view. But the problem says that when the star isn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would give the same amplitude. Hmm, maybe I should model the brightness variation caused by the spots and see what that amplitude is, then equate it to the planet transit case.

Let me think. The star's normal brightness is based on its effective temperature. But the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the total brightness decreases. The spots have a filling factor F, which is 20% (0.2), but only on one hemisphere. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. How is the filling factor applied? Filling factor, I think, is the fraction of the stellar surface covered by spots. So if the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, that's 10% of the total surface area of the star. Because a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10%.

Wait no, wait. The problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is the fraction of that hemisphere that is spots. So the total spot area is 20% of half the star's surface, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10% of the star's total surface area. So 10% of the star's surface is spots.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But with spots, the effective temperature in those regions is lower. So the total flux from the star would be:

L = (1 - f) * L0 + f * L_spot,

where f is the filling factor (0.1), L0 is the flux per unit area from the non-spotty regions, and L_spot is the flux per unit area from the spots.

Wait, but wait, maybe the star's total emitted flux is the sum of the non-spotted areas and the spotted areas. Since the spots are cooler, their contribution is less.

So L0 = σ Teff^4. The non-spotted area is (1 - f) * surface area, and the spotted area is f * surface area. So total L = ( (1 - f)*Teff² + f*T_spot² ) * (π R² σ )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of fluxes.

The star's total flux is the sum of each part. The flux from the non-spotted area is (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 * (4π R²), but wait, no, maybe better to think in terms of surface brightness. The surface brightness is σ T^4. So each part of the surface contributes to the total.

So the star's total luminosity is:

L = (1 - f) * 4π R² σ Teff^4 + f * 4π R² σ T_spot^4.

Wait, no, because the filling factor f is the fraction of the surface covered by spots, so f multiplied by the surface area (4π R²), and the rest (1 - f) is the non-spotted area.

So,

L = (1 - f) * (4π R²) * σ Teff^4 + f * (4π R²) * σ T_spot^4.

We can factor out 4π R² σ:

L = 4π R² σ [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since the star is rotating, we see different fractions of the spotted and non-spotted regions.

Wait, but the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotted. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the spotted hemisphere is rotating into and out of view. So the maximum and minimum brightness would occur when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible or not visible.

Wait, perhaps when the star is seen such that the spotted hemisphere is fully visible, the flux is lower than when it's not visible. So the variation in brightness would be the difference between the star's maximum brightness (when the spots are not visible) and the minimum (when the spots are fully visible).

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the observed brightness would vary as the spots rotate into and out of view. The maximum brightness would be when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The minimum would be when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star's surface is a sphere. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere that's facing us can have either the spotted or non-spotted side. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, and the observed flux changes.

So the maximum flux is when the unspotted side is fully visible. The minimum flux is when the spotted side is fully visible. But wait, wait, no. Because the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere may be facing us or not.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the change in flux as the star rotates. Let me think. Let the star's rotation cause the spots to come into view. When the spot hemisphere is facing us, the observed brightness is lower. When the other hemisphere (non-spotted) is facing us, the brightness is higher.

Wait, but wait, the star is a sphere. The hemisphere that's facing us is a disk. So when the star rotates, the spots on the surface may come into the line of sight or not. Wait, no, the star's rotation causes different parts of its surface to face us. So if the spots are on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. When the other hemisphere is facing us, we don't.

Wait, but the star's rotation is such that the spots are on one hemisphere, so as it rotates, the spots come into view and then move out of view. So the brightness variation would be a sinusoidal-like curve, perhaps, as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but in this problem, the star is observed with photometric time-series, which shows periodic variations because of rotational modulation. So the star's brightness varies as the spots come into and out of view. Let me model the maximum and minimum brightness.

The star's brightness without any spots would be L0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

But with spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is L_min, and when the non-spotted is facing us, it's L_max.

Wait no, when we're looking at the star, the area that is visible is a circle (the disk). So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots would cover part of the disk. Wait, but the hemisphere is entirely covered in spots, but only a part of that hemisphere is visible at any given time.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should model the observed flux when the spotted and non-spotted hemispheres are facing us.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the variation in brightness. The amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

So when the star is in a position where the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher, and when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to rotate into and out of view, so the observed flux would change.

Wait, perhaps the average flux from the star is somewhere in between the two extremes. Hmm, maybe I should compute the average flux when the star is rotating, and the variation from that average.

But perhaps the problem is easier if I consider the variation in brightness caused by the spots when the star is rotating. Let me think.

Each point on the star's surface emits with a certain brightness. When the star is viewed from Earth, we see a certain portion of the surface. As the star rotates, the proportion of spotted and non-spotted areas in the visible disk changes.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when you look at it, you see a circle. The area of the disk is π R². The spots are on the hemisphere, so whether a spot is on the visible hemisphere or not depends on the star's rotation.

Wait, perhaps the spots are fixed on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the visible part of the spots changes. But maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation in brightness is caused by the spots being in view. The maximum dip in brightness occurs when the maximum area of spots is in front, and the minimum dip when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

But how much does the brightness change between these two extremes?

Let me think about the flux when the star is in these two states.

When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire disk is non-spotted. So the flux is:

F_non_spotted = (1 - f) * (Teff^4) * (π R²) * σ ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should model the flux from the star as the sum of the flux from the visible part of the non-spotted regions and the visible part of the spotted regions.

But this might get too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the change in brightness when the spotted area is in view.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants us to find the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then find the exoplanet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

So the brightness variation amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, divided by the average brightness.

Wait, but wait, in the case of the spots, the star's brightness varies as the spots come into view. The amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation in brightness. For the exoplanet, the amplitude is the dip when the planet transits, which is when the planet blocks some of the star's light.

But for the exoplanet, the transit would cause a dip in brightness equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2 * F0, where F0 is the star's flux without any blockage.

For the spots, the variation is due to the change in flux as different parts of the star's surface become visible. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, and the maximum brightness is when they're not.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F0 minus the flux lost due to the spots.

But perhaps the problem is considering the variation in brightness when the star is rotating, so the brightness varies because the spots come into and out of view.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is given by the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, divided by the average flux.

Wait, let me compute the maximum and minimum flux.

When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_max = (1 - f) * (Teff^4) * (4π R² σ) * (1/4) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The star's luminosity without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

With the spots, the star's total luminosity is L = (1 - f) L0 + f L_spot,

where L_spot = 4π R² σ T_spot^4 * f.

Wait, perhaps better to compute L as (1 - f) * L0_non_spotted + f * L_spot,

where L0_non_spotted is the luminosity of the non-spotted part.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the average flux when the star is rotating, and the variation from that average.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to model the change in flux as the spots rotate into view.

Wait, the star's brightness variation would be maximum when all the spots are in front, and minimum when none are. But wait, no, the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so we don't see them. No, wait, no. Wait, if the spots are on the front hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible. If the spots are on the far side, we don't see them.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us versus when it's not.

But perhaps this is getting complicated, and I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, the problem says that the brightness variation is periodic due to rotational modulation. So the amplitude of this variation is what we're interested in.

The star has a certain effective temperature, and the spots are cooler. The brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, perhaps the maximum change in brightness occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. But that's not possible because the hemisphere facing us is a disk, and the full hemisphere would be 2π steradians, but from Earth, we can only see a circle of radius R, which is π R².

Wait, perhaps the fraction of the spotted area that is visible when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is (pi R^2) / (2 * 4 pi R^2) ) * f? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of the star's surface that is both in the spotted hemisphere and visible from Earth is (the area of the disk) / (the area of the hemisphere) ) multiplied by the filling factor.

Wait, the area of the disk is π R². The area of the hemisphere is 2 π R². So the fraction of the hemisphere that is visible is (π R²) / (2 π R²) ) = 1/2. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is half of that hemisphere. So the fraction of the spotted area that is visible is (f * (hemisphere area)) * (visible hemisphere fraction) ?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved by considering the total area of spots as a fraction of the star's surface, and the change in brightness when that area is in view.

Wait, another approach: the star's brightness without spots is F0. When the spots are in view, the brightness is F = F0 - (fraction of spots visible) * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) * something.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip in brightness occurs when all the spots are in front of the star. The maximum dip would then be (A_spots / A_star) * (F0 - F_spots). 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to model it.

The star's total flux without spots: F0 = σ Teff^4.

With spots covering a fraction f of the surface, each spot has a temperature T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the total flux when the spots are present is F = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot,

where F_spot = σ (T_spot)^4.

So F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ].

Wait, that's the total flux. But when the star rotates, the fraction of the spots visible changes.

Wait, but in this problem, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the observed flux would vary between F0 (no spots visible) and F when the maximum number of spots is visible.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip in flux is when the entire spotted area is in view, which would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. So the flux would be F = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot.

Wait, no. Because when the entire spotted hemisphere is in view, the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted and visible is f * (area of hemisphere) / (total star area).

Wait, the area of the hemisphere is 2 π R². The total star area is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star that is spotted when the entire hemisphere is visible is (f * 2 π R²) / (4 π R²) )= (f * 2) /4 ) = f/2. But wait, the filling factor is f, which is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered in spots. So perhaps when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the star's surface that's visible and spotted is (f * hemisphere area)/(total area) ) = (f * 2 π R² ) / (4 π R^2 ) = f/2.

Wait, but the filling factor f is already the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So if the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the star's surface that's spotted and visible is f, because the entire spotted area is in the hemisphere that's visible.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about it differently.

Let me think about the star's surface as being split into two hemispheres: one with spots covering f (20%) of that hemisphere, and the other without spots. Wait, no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20% of spots, so the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

The entire star's surface is 4 π R², so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R² ) = 0.1, or 10%. So f_total = 0.1.

But then, when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. So the fraction of the star's surface that's visible and spotted depends on the rotation.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² of spots is visible. So the fraction of the star's surface that's spotted and visible is 0.4 π R² / (π R² ) = 0.4. So 40% of the visible disk is spots.

But wait, that would make the fraction of the star's surface that's in view and spotted be 40% of the disk. But the disk is π R², and the total area is 4 π R², so the maximum fraction of the star's surface that can be in view is 25% (π R² / 4 π R² = 1/4). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of the star's surface that is in view is 25%, but the fraction of that which is spotted depends on whether the spots are in the visible hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the star's surface that's spotted and visible is (f * hemisphere area) / (star area) ) × (visible area) ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach is better. Let's think about the maximum and minimum flux.

The maximum flux occurs when no spots are visible. So F_max = F0 = (4π R² σ Teff^4) / (4π) )? No, perhaps F0 is σ Teff^4, because flux per unit area is σ Teff^4.

Wait, maybe the star's flux is F0 = σ Teff^4. When spots are present, the flux is F = (1 - f) σ Teff^4 + f σ T_spot^4.

Wait, but that's the total flux when all the spots are in view. But in reality, when the star rotates, the fraction of the spotted area in view changes.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is F0, and the minimum is F when the entire spotted area is in view. So the amplitude is F0 - F.

But what is F?

F = (1 - f) F0 + f (F_spot),

where F_spot = σ (Teff - 1000K)^4.

So the amplitude would be (F0 - F) = F0 - [ (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot ] = F0 (1 - (1 - f) ) - f F_spot = F0 f - f F_spot = f (F0 - F_spot).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is f (F0 - F_spot).

Wait, but wait, this would be the difference between maximum and minimum flux. So the amplitude would be F0 - F.

But wait, when the star is rotating, the brightness varies between F0 (no spots in view) and F (all spots in view), so the amplitude is F0 - F.

So, substituting F = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot,

Amplitude = F0 - [ (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot ] = F0 * f - f F_spot = f (F0 - F_spot).

So the amplitude is f (F0 - F_spot).

Now, F0 is σ Teff^4, and F_spot is σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

So, F0 = σ (6000)^4,

F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So, F0 - F_spot = σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

So, the amplitude is f σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

But wait, f is 0.1, because 20% of one hemisphere is spotted, which covers 10% of the entire star.

Wait, the filling factor f is 0.2 for the hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 × (hemisphere area) = 0.2 × 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². Total area is 4 π R², so f_total = 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1. So f_total = 0.1.

So, amplitude = 0.1 × σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

But for the exoplanet case, the amplitude is when the planet transits, blocking a part of the star's light. The amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2 × F0.

Wait, because when the planet blocks an area of π Rp², the dip in flux is (π Rp² / (4 π Rstar²)) × F0.

Wait, the dip is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) × (F0 × (π Rstar² /4 π Rstar²)) ) → no, perhaps the dip is (Rp^2 / (4 Rstar^2)) × F0 × 4?

Wait, I'm a bit confused, perhaps it's better to model it as:

The flux dip ΔF is (area of planet / area of star) × F0.

Area of planet is π Rp^2, area of star is π Rstar^2 (since we see a circle of radius Rstar).

Wait, no, the area of the star as seen from Earth is π Rstar^2, but the actual area is 4 π Rstar^2. So when a planet transits, the blocked area is the area of the planet's disk on the star's disk, which is (Rp / Rstar)^2 × (π Rstar^2), so the flux dip is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) × F0.

Wait, F0 is the flux without any blockage. So the dip is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) × F0.

So the amplitude for the planet is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) × F0.

The problem states that this planet-induced amplitude should be equal to the spot-induced amplitude. So:

(Rp^2 / Rstar^2) × F0 = f (F0 - F_spot).

We can cancel F0 from both sides:

(Rp^2 / Rstar^2) = f (1 - (F_spot / F0 )),

since F_spot = F0 × (T_spot / T_eff)^4.

So,

Rp^2/Rstar^2 = f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ]

Taking square roots,

Rp/Rstar = sqrt( f [ 1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ] )

Plugging in the numbers:

T_eff = 6000 K,

T_spot = 5000 K.

So,

(T_spot / T_eff )^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

Calculating that:

0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944,

so 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So,

1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

f is 0.1.

So,

sqrt(0.1 * 0.5177 ) = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are around 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, etc. Hmm, 0.2275 isn't exactly matching any option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, in the problem, the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². The total area of the star is 4 π R², so f = 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1, which is correct.

Then, the amplitude for the spot case is f (F0 - F_spot) = 0.1 (F0 - F_spot).

The planet's amplitude is (Rp^2/Rstar^2) F0.

Setting them equal:

(Rp^2/Rstar^2) F0 = 0.1 (F0 - F_spot).

Divide both sides by F0:

Rp^2/Rstar^2 = 0.1 (1 - (F_spot/F0)).

F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spots, which is σ (5000)^4.

F0 is σ (6000)^4.

So F_spot/F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747.

Taking square root: sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm, but none of the options are 0.22.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots isn't f (F0 - F_spot), but something else.

Wait, another approach: When the star rotates, the spots are moving in and out of view. The brightness variation would be more complex than a simple dip when all spots are in view. Perhaps it's more accurate to model the brightness variation as the difference between the unspotted and spotted portions when they are in view.

Wait, but perhaps the key is to model the brightness variation as the difference between when the star is entirely non-spotted (maximum brightness) and when the entire spotted hemisphere is in view (minimum brightness). So the change would be the difference in flux between those two states.

Wait, but the flux in the maximum state is F0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

In the minimum state, the flux is F_min = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot.

Wait, no, because when the entire spotted hemisphere is in view, the fraction of the star's surface that's spotted is f. So F_min = F0 × (1 - f) + f F_spot.

So the amplitude is F0 - F_min = F0 - [ F0 (1 - f) + f F_spot ] = F0 f - f F_spot = f (F0 - F_spot).

Same as before. So that gives the same result.

So, perhaps the options are wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recompute (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.833333.

0.833333^2 ≈ 0.694444.

0.694444^2 ≈ 0.482253. So yes, correct.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.1, 0.0517747.

Square root is approximately 0.2275.

But the options don't have that value. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the variation in brightness as the difference between the maximum and average brightness, not the maximum and minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is modeled as the star's brightness varying sinusoidally, and the amplitude is the peak-to-peak difference.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spotted area in view varies. Let me model the fraction of the star's surface that is covered by spots as a function of the rotation angle.

But perhaps this is too complicated, and I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the relative change in flux as the spot area is in view.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip in brightness is when the entire spotted area is in front of the star, which would be f × (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) × some factor.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip is (f) × (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) × (F0 / T_eff^4).

Wait, no, perhaps the dip is f × (F_spot - F0) + F0 × (1 - f), which isn't quite making sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by simply considering that the dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the change in flux as a function of the fraction of the star's surface that is in the spots and their temperature.

So the amplitude would be (f) × (F0 - F_spot).

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is modeled as the brightness variation being caused by the spots on the star, which could be similar to the planet transit in terms of the dip.

In the planet case, the dip is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) × F0.

In the spot case, the maximum dip is when all spots are in view, which is f × (F0 - F_spot) × (F0 / (F0 - F_spot)) )? Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the flux from the star when the spots are in view is F = F0 × (1 - f) + f × (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4).

So F = F0 × [ (1 - f) + f × (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ].

The dip in flux is F0 - F = F0 × [ 1 - ( (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ] = F0 × [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ].

So dip amplitude is F0 × f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

The planet's dip amplitude is (Rp^2 / Rstar^2) × F0.

Setting them equal:

(Rp^2 / Rstar^2) × F0 = F0 × f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

Cancel F0:

Rp^2 / Rstar^2 = f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So,

Rp/Rstar = sqrt( f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ).

Plugging the numbers:

f = 0.1,

T_spot =5000,

T_eff=6000.

So,

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by f=0.1: 0.0517747.

Square root: sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, but that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of f. Let me recheck.

In the problem, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere.

The hemisphere's area is 2 π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 × 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

The total area of the star is 4 π R², so the fraction f is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1. So f is 0.1, which is 10%.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the hemisphere's filling factor without considering the total area.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the hemisphere's filling factor as 20%, so when the star rotates, the maximum fraction of the star's disk that is covered by spots is 20% of the disk's area. So the area covered is 0.2 × (π Rstar²) = 0.2 π Rstar².

So the fraction is 0.2, not 0.1.

Wait, that would change everything. Let me think again.

If the maximum fraction of the star's disk that's covered by spots when the hemisphere is facing us is 20%, then the area is 0.2 × π Rstar².

So in that case, f would be 0.2 × (π Rstar²) / (4 π Rstar² ) ) = 0.05.

Wait, no, because when the hemisphere is facing us, the disk area is π R², and the spots cover 20% of this disk. So the area in the disk covered by spots is 0.2 × π R².

But the total star area is 4 π R², so the fraction f is (0.2 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.05.

So f = 0.05.

Wait, that would change the calculation.

So then,

Rp/Rstar = sqrt( f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) )

f=0.05,

1 - (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.517747.

So,

0.05 × 0.517747 ≈ 0.025887.

sqrt(0.025887) ≈ 0.1608.

Which is approximately 0.16.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.11 or option B) ~0.07.

But 0.16 is not exactly matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that only one hemisphere is spotty, so when the star rotates, the maximum spotted area in view is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the total star's area. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so when the hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the disk is covered by spots. Therefore, the area of spots in the disk is 0.2 × π R², so the fraction is 0.2 × π R² / (4 π R² ) = 0.05. So f = 0.05.

So then, the calculation would be:

sqrt(0.05 × 0.517747) = sqrt(0.025887) ≈ 0.1608.

Which is approximately 0.16, which isn't matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the way the spots are arranged. Let me think again.

The star has one hemisphere with spots covering 20% of its area, and the other hemisphere is spotless. So when the star rotates, the maximum fraction of the star's disk covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the disk.

Wait, the disk area is π R². The hemisphere area is 2 π R². So 20% of the hemisphere is 0.2 × 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². The disk area is π R², so the maximum fraction of the disk covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (π R² ) = 0.4, or 40%.

Wait, that can't be right, because the hemisphere's area is 2 π R², so 20% of that is 0.4 π R², which is less than the disk area of π R². So when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 π R² of spots is within the disk, so the fraction of the disk covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4. So 40% coverage.

Ah, so that's different. So f in this case is 0.4, because when the hemisphere is facing us, 40% of the disk is covered by spots.

But this is only when the hemisphere is facing us. When the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere is facing us, which has no spots, so 0% coverage.

So the brightness varies between 0% dip and 40% dip.

Wait, but how does that affect the amplitude?

Wait, perhaps the average brightness is when the spots are in a position where the fraction in view is 20% of the hemisphere's coverage, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is sinusoidal, with a peak when the spots are fully in view and a trough when they're not.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when 40% of the disk is covered by spots. So the dip is 40% of (F0 - F_spot) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

The problem is asking for the radius of a planet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the star's brightness variation caused by the spots.

The amplitude for the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

The amplitude for the spots is the difference between the maximum (no spots in view) and minimum (all spots in view) brightness.

So, F0 (max) and F_min.

F0 = σ Teff^4.

F_min = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot.

f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, which is 20% of one hemisphere, so 10% of the total surface. So f = 0.1.

F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So,

F_min = (0.9) F0 + 0.1 F_spot.

The amplitude is F0 - F_min = F0 - 0.9 F0 - 0.1 F_spot = 0.1 F0 - 0.1 F_spot = 0.1 (F0 - F_spot).

Which is what I had earlier.

So, the planet's amplitude is (Rp^2/Rstar^2) F0.

Setting them equal:

(Rp^2/Rstar^2) F0 = 0.1 (F0 - F_spot).

Divide both sides by F0:

Rp^2/Rstar^2 = 0.1 (1 - (F_spot / F0)).

Which is 0.1 × (1 - (5000/6000)^4) ≈ 0.1 × (1 - 0.482253) ≈ 0.1 × 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747.

So,

Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.0517747) ≈ 0.2275.

But this is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the spots' effect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on the hemisphere that's facing us, so the entire 20% of the hemisphere is visible when the star is viewed, but that's not correct because the hemisphere's area is larger than the disk.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should consider the brightness variation as the spots rotate, leading to a sinusoidal variation with a certain amplitude.

The amplitude of the brightness variation (ΔF) would be proportional to the area of the spots and their temperature difference, modulated by their visibility as the star rotates.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the relative change in flux when the spots are in view, considering their position on the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps the variation in flux is given by the equation:

ΔF = F0 × [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) - 1 ].

Wait, that would be F = F0 × [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ].

So,

ΔF = F0 × [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ] - F0 = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) - 1 ] = F0 [ -f + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) ) ] = F0 f ( (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) - 1 )

Which is the same as before.

So,

ΔF = F0 × f × ( (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4) - 1 )

But wait, that would give a negative value, which can't be right. So perhaps the correct expression is:

ΔF = F0 - F = F0 [1 - ( (1 - f) + f (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ]

Which is F0 [ f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) ].

So same as before.

I think I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275, but the options don't include this. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the peak-to-peak variation, not just the dip from maximum to minimum. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the change as the spots move into and out of view, leading to a sinusoidal variation with a certain amplitude. The amplitude would then be proportional to the product of the spot area and the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the variation in brightness due to the spots is modeled as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude that depends on the spot area and the temperature difference.

The amplitude of the brightness variation would be:

A = (ΔF) × (1 / F0 )

where ΔF is the peak-to-peak variation.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the relative brightness variation as:

A = (Area of spots / Area of star) × (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) / T_eff^4.

Which would be:

A = f × (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) / T_eff^4.

Which would be f × ( (T_spot / T_eff )^4 - 1 )

But since T_spot < T_eff, this would give a negative value, but the amplitude is the absolute value.

So,

A = | f × ( (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) / T_eff^4 ) | = f × ( (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) / T_eff^4 )

Which is f × [1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 ]

Which is the same as before.

So,

A = 0.1 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 × 0.517747 ≈ 0.0517747.

The planet's amplitude is (Rp/Rstar)^2, so setting them equal:

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517747 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots on the hemisphere, but the effective temperature is an average. So the area of the spots is f × (hemisphere area) = 0.2 × 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². The total area is 4 π R². So the fraction is 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1. So f is 0.1.

But then, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as a blackbody with temperature T_spot, and the brightness variation is the difference between the star's flux and the flux with the spots in view.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the fact that the brightness variation amplitude is the same as the planet's transit dip, so:

Planet's dip amplitude: (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Spot's dip amplitude: f × (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )).

So,

Rp/Rstar = sqrt( f × (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) )

Which leads to sqrt(0.1 × 0.517747) ≈ 0.2275.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the hemisphere's filling factor as 20%, so when the hemisphere is facing us, the fraction of the disk covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area relative to the disk.

But the disk's area is π R², and the hemisphere's area is 2 π R².

So 20% of the hemisphere's area is 0.4 π R², which is 40% of the disk's area (since disk is π R², 0.4 π R² is 40% of π R²).

So f is 0.4.

Ah, that might be the mistake. So f is 0.4, not 0.1.

So,

A = 0.4 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.4 × 0.517747 ≈ 0.2071.

So,

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.4548.

Hmm, but that's not matching any option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that when the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 20% of that hemisphere is in view, so the fraction is 20% of the disk's area.

Disk area is π R². 20% of the hemisphere's area (which is 2 π R²) is 0.2 × 2 π R² = 0.4 π R². So the fraction of the disk covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4, or 40%.

So f = 0.4.

So,

A = 0.4 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.4 × 0.517747 ≈ 0.2071.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.2071) ≈ 0.4548 → ~0.45.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, perhaps the correct calculation leads to option C) ~0.11.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute:

0.517747 × 0.1 = 0.0517747.

Square root: sqrt(0.0517747) = approximately 0.2275.

But perhaps the problem expects the fraction to be f × (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^2 ), not the fourth power.

Wait, no, because flux is proportional to T^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the product of the area and the temperature difference, not considering the fourth power.

But that would be incorrect, as flux depends on T^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the relative change in brightness as f × (T_spot - T_eff) / T_eff.

But that would be a linear approximation and incorrect. But let's try:

(T_spot - T_eff) = -1000 K.

So,

Relative change = f × (-1000 / 6000 ) = 0.1 × (-1/6) ≈ -0.016667.

Amplitude would be 0.016667, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.016667) ≈ 0.129.

Close to option C) ~0.11.

But why would the problem make such an approximation? It's not accurate, but perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a simple approximation, like (T_spot - T_eff) / T_eff × f.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about f.

Alternatively, perhaps f is 0.2, not 0.1.

Wait, the problem says that one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%. So the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots is 20%, so the total fraction of the star's surface is (0.2 × 2 π R²)/(4 π R²) )= 0.1. So f=0.1.

So, that's correct.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given the choices, the closest is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, no, 0.2275 is approximately 0.23, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is comparing the brightness variation of the star to that of the planet. The star's brightness variation is due to the spots, which cause a dip, while the planet causes a dip when it transits.

Wait, perhaps the star's variation is the same as the planet's, so the amplitude is the same. So perhaps the approach is correct, but the options are wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the brightness variation caused by the spots is given by the product of the area of the spots and the difference in flux per unit area.

So,

Amplitude = (Area of spots / Area of star) × (F_spot - F0).

But since F_spot < F0, this would be negative, so the amplitude is the absolute value.

So,

Amplitude = (0.1) × (F0 - F_spot).

Which is same as before.

So,

Amplitude = 0.1 × F0 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 × F0 × 0.517747.

The planet's amplitude is (Rp^2/Rstar^2) × F0.

Setting them equal:

(Rp^2/Rstar^2) = 0.1 × 0.517747 ≈ 0.051775.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.051775) ≈ 0.2275.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, perhaps option C) ~0.11 is the closest, but that's a big discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Wait, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333333.

0.8333333^4:

0.8333333^2 = 0.6944444.

0.6944444^2 = 0.482253.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the area of the spots as a fraction of the star's surface, and the dip in brightness is that fraction multiplied by the difference in brightness per unit area.

But I think I've tried that.

Perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, as 0.1 squared is 0.01, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, 0.11 squared is ~0.0121, which is close to 0.0121 × F0.

But our amplitude is 0.051775 × F0, which is larger.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should go with the calculation and see if any option is close.

Wait, 0.2275 is approximately 0.23, which is near option D) ~0.32, but not very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of (5/6)^4.

Wait, 5^4 = 625, 6^4 = 1296.

So (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I can't see how. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the difference between the spotted and non-spotted areas when they are in view, but only considering the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

So,

F_max = (1 - f) F0 + f F_spot.

Wait, no, when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are on the back side, so the flux is F0.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_min = f × F_spot + (1 - f) × F0.

Wait, no, because the non-spotted part of the hemisphere (which is 80%) contributes normally.

Wait, perhaps,

F_min = (1 - f + f × T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 ) × F0.

Which brings us back to the same formula.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all the approaches and can't find a way to get any of the given options. Perhaps the correct approach gives an answer not listed, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

But given the calculation, I'm more confident that the correct answer is approximately 0.23, which isn't listed. So perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the fraction f. Perhaps the problem is considering the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, not just the hemisphere.

Wait, if the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then f=0.2.

So,

Amplitude = 0.2 × (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 × 0.517747 ≈ 0.103549.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.103549 ) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, matching option D).

Ah, that makes sense. So perhaps I misread the problem. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So f is 0.2, not 0.1. Because the entire hemisphere's filling factor is 20%, so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 20% × (hemisphere area) / (star area) ) = 0.2 × (2 π R²) / (4 π R² ) ) = 0.2 × 0.5 = 0.1. So f=0.1.

Wait, but perhaps the problem intended f to be 0.2, not 0.1. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.

The problem says: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So f is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's surface.

But if I take f as 0.2, then,

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.2 × 0.517747) ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is option D) ~0.32.

That's one of the options. So perhaps the intended approach was to take f=0.2, perhaps the problem meant that the entire star has a filling factor of 20%, but it's stated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, but the text says it's per hemisphere.

Hmm.

But given that the correct calculation using f=0.1 gives an answer not in the options, but using f=0.2 gives option D), perhaps the intended answer is D) ~0.32.


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star's brightness changes caused by dark spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (T_spot = 5000 K). The key steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. **Understanding the Filling Factor**:  
   The filling factor of 20% applies to one hemisphere of the star. The total area of the star is \(4\pi R^2\), and the area of one hemisphere is \(2\pi R^2\). Thus, the total spotted area is \(0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2\). The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:  
   \[
   f = \frac{\text{Spotted Area}}{\text{Total Area}} = \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1
   \]

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   The star's total flux without spots is \(F_0 = \sigma \text{Te}_{\text{eff}}^4\). With spots, the flux is:  
   \[
   F_{\text{min}} = (1 - f)F_0 + fF_{\text{spot}}, \quad \text{where } F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
   \]  
   The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux:  
   \[
   \Delta F = F_0 - F_{\text{min}} = F_0 - \left[(1 - f)F_0 + fF_{\text{spot}}\right] = fF_0 - fF_{\text{spot}}
   \]  
   Substituting \(F_{\text{spot}} = F_0 \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\):  
   \[
   \Delta F = fF_0 \left[1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right]
   \]  
   The relative amplitude is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = f \left[1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right]
   \]

3. **Planet's Brightness Variation**:  
   For a planet transiting the star, the brightness variation amplitude is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F_{\text{planet}}}{F_0} = \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
   \]  
   Setting the amplitudes equal:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = f \left[1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right]
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{f \left[1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right]}
   \]

4. **Substituting Values**:  
   - \(f = 0.1\) (10% of the star's surface is covered by spots).  
   - \(T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}, \, T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K}\).  
   - \(\left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.482253\).  
   - \(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 \approx 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747\).  
   - \(f \times 0.517747 = 0.1 \times 0.517747 = 0.0517747\).  
   - \(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.0517747} \approx 0.2275\).

5. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \(R_p/R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.2275\) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the filling factor \(f\) is incorrectly interpreted as 0.2 (20% of the entire star's surface instead of 10%), the calculation yields:  
   \[
   \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.2 \times 0.517747} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
   \]  
   This matches option D) \( \sim 0.32 \).

6. **Conclusion**:  
   The problem likely assumes \(f = 0.2\) instead of \(f = 0.1\), leading to the closest match with the provided options.

ANSWER: D
