Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, which I think relates to the orbital period of the stars around each other.

Then, there are some spectroscopic observations about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We're told to consider the mass of a system as the sum of the two stars.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to detect the stars' orbits. The velocities are measured using the Doppler shift. Each star orbits the common center of mass, so their velocities are related to the masses of the stars.

I think the formula that relates the velocities to the masses is something like m1/m2 = v2/v1. Because the center of mass is where m1*v1 = m2*v2, so the mass ratio is inverse of the velocity ratio. Oh right, that's correct. So m1/m2 = v2 / v1.

But wait, each system has two stars. Let me think. For system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say star A has velocity 10, and star B has 5. So the mass ratio would be m_A/m_B = v_B / v_A = 5 /10 = 0.5. So m_A is half the mass of m_B. Therefore, the total mass for system_1 is m_A + m_B = 0.5 m_B + m_B = 1.5 m_B.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. Let's call them v1=15 and v2=10. Then m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So the mass ratio is m1 = (2/3) m2. The total mass is m1 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2.

But wait, the question is about the mass of each system, so system_1's total mass is 1.5 m_B, and system_2's is 5/3 m2. But how do these relate to each other?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. There's another approach. The mass function in binary systems relates the observed velocities and the orbital period to the masses. The formula for the mass function is f(m) = (v^3 * P) / (2π G), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a spectroscopic binary, the mass function is f(m) = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2π G ), where K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the mass ratio and the velocity amplitudes. The mass function, though, I might need to recall. Alternatively, the mass ratio (q = m2/m1) is equal to (v1/v2). Or wait, no, because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity. So if star A is more massive, it would orbit slower.

Right. So the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude. So the mass is inversely proportional to their velocity. So if in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5, then m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 m2. So the total mass would be m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly in system_2, velocities are 15 and 10, so m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So m1 = (2/3) m2. Total mass is (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2.

Wait wait, but system_2 has velocities 15 and 10. So if star A is 15 km/s and star B is 10, then m_A / m_B = 10/15 = 2/3. So m_A is (2/3) m_B. So total mass is (2/3 m_B) + m_B = (5/3) m_B.

Wait, but now we're comparing system_1's total mass to system_2's. So system_1’s mass is 1.5 m_B (where m_B is one star's mass), and system_2's mass is (5/3) m_B'. Wait, but each system's two stars have their own masses. So perhaps I need to find the total mass of each system in terms of their respective velocities and periods.

I think I might be complicating this. Let me recall the formula for the mass function. For a binary system, the mass function is given by f(m) = ( (v^3) * P ) / (2 π G ), but perhaps that's when you can't see both stars. But in this case, we can see both, so we can get the mass ratio.

Alternatively, the mass function for each star is:

f(m) = (v1^3 * P) / (2 π G (1 + q)^2 ), where q is the mass ratio m2/m1.

But wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the mass ratio and the velocity amplitudes.

In each system, the two stars have velocities v1 and v2. The mass ratio q = m2/m1 = v1 / v2.

So in system_1: v1=10, v2=5. So q = 5/10 = 0.5. So m2 is 0.5 m1. Therefore, m1 = m2 / 0.5 = 2 m2. So the total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait
