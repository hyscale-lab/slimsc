Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials for two reactions. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says a chemist performed two reactions using two unknown compounds, A and B, and treated them with different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually looking again, the products are different based on the reagents. Reaction 1 uses LiBH4 with H+ and produces (R)-4-ethyl..., and reaction 2 uses BH3 with H+ to produce (S)-4-ethyl... Hmm, but wait, no, the way the question is phrased, each reaction gives a product. So for reaction A (with LiBH4), the product is R configuration, and for reaction B (with BH3), the product is S configuration.

Wait, no, the question says: A plus LiBH4 and H+ gives (R)-product; B plus BH3 and H+ gives (S)-product. So I need to find the starting materials A and B such that when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives the R configuration, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives the S configuration.

The options are four possibilities for what A and B are. All the options have A and B being either (S) or (R) of the same compound: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the starting materials are enantiomers or maybe the same. The question is about how the configuration of the starting material affects the configuration of the product.

Let me think about the reactions here. Both are reductions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing carbonyl groups. BH3 is another reducing agent, perhaps in a different context. Wait, but wait, in the context of ketones, BH3 isn't typically a reducing agent—it's more of a Lewis acid used in hydroboration reactions. Oh wait, but when the reducing agent is involved in ketone reductions, maybe it's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of borohydride and another hydride source.

Wait, LiBH4 is a hydride donor—it reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. But the product here is a pyranone. Hmm, that's a cyclic ketone. Wait, so if the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, perhaps this is a case of forming a cyclic ketone via an aldol condensation or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, wait a second. The products are 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring (tetrahydro-pyran), with a ketone group at position 2. The numbering is such that position 4 has an ethyl group.

So the product is a cyclic ketone. So the starting material A and B must be compounds that can form this upon reduction.

But wait, starting materials are
