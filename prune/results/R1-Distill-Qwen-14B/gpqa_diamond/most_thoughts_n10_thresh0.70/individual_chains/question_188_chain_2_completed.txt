Okay, so I have this question about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles the same. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. The question is about the (111) plane.

Wait, I think the interplanar distance formula for crystals is d = a / sqrt( l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ ), but wait, no, I'm mixing something up. Oh right, wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ( ... )). Or maybe I'm getting the Miller indices mixed in.

Wait, no, I think for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But this is a rhombohedral system, which is a special case. So the formula might be a bit different because the angles between the axes aren't 90 degrees.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but in this case, it's a rhombohedron, so a = b = c, let's say a. And the angles are all the same, 30 degrees each.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system for a plane (hkl) is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the axes. But wait, no, that might not be exactly right. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember the general formula for a crystal with lattice vectors a, b, c, and angles between them is given by 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk (cos α)/(a² b² c²))... No, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the metric tensor. The interplanar distance formula for hkl plane is d = sqrt( (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a b h k cos γ + 2 a c h l cos β + 2 b c k l cos α )^-1 ), but wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is simplified since a = b = c, and the angles are all equal.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors (since all angles are same, 30 degrees here). So for the (111) plane, h, k, l are all 1.

So substituting, d = a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos(30°)).

Wait, let me compute that step by step. The denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3) * cos(30)). Because sum h² is 3, and 2(hk + hl + kl) is 2*(1+1+1)=6, multiplied by cos(30). So 6 * cos(30).

Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3). Because 6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3*sqrt(3).

So 3 + 3*sqrt(3) = 3*(1 + sqrt(3)).

Thus, d = a / sqrt(3*(1 + sqrt(3))).

But a is given as the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. So a is 10.

So let's compute sqrt(3*(1 + sqrt(3))).

Compute 3*(1 + sqrt(3)) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.

So 3*sqrt(3) is about 5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9 or 8 or 10, not 3.

Wait, wait a second. Did I get the formula wrong? Because the interplanar distance in a rhombohedron is given by a different formula. Or perhaps I mixed up the angles?

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c, and angles alpha = beta = gamma = theta. Then the interplanar distance for (hkl) is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ).

Wait, let me double-check that. For a cubic system (theta=90), the formula becomes a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct. So for theta=30, the formula would be as above.

So for (111): h=k=l=1.

d = a / sqrt( 1 + 1 +1 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos(30) )

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) )

Because cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2.

So 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3).

So denominator is sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

So 3 +3*sqrt(3) is approximately 3 +5.196 =8.196.

sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms.

But the options are in the 8-10 range. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I confused the interatomic distance with something else. Wait, interatomic distance 'a' is the length of the lattice vector, right? Or is it something else?

Wait, no, in a crystal, the interatomic distance depends on the structure. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, the lattice parameter. But in a hexagonal close-packed structure, the interatomic distance along the c-axis is different.

Wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms. Or is it something else? Because in some cases, the interatomic distance is not the same as the lattice parameter.

Wait, in a face-centered cubic structure, each atom is surrounded by others at a distance of a*sqrt(2)/2, etc. So perhaps in this case, the interatomic distance is the same as 'a', since the structure is rhombohedral—perhaps it's a simple rhombohedral structure where each atom is at the corners. So yes, 'a' would be the interatomic distance.

So a is 10. Then using the formula, d is 10 / sqrt(3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)) ) =10 / sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

But then, as I calculated, that's around 3.492, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign or the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (1/(d^2)) = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk + hl + kl)(cos(alpha))/(a^2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk + 2 hl + 2 kl) * (cos α)/(a²).

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me try looking for the correct formula.

Alternatively, the general formula for d is given by:

d = [ (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^2 (hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

d = [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) a^2 + 2 a^2 (h k cos gamma + h l cos beta + k l cos alpha) ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, but in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the axes. In a rhombohedral system, the angle between a and b is alpha, between a and c is beta, and between b and c is gamma.

But since a = b = c, and all angles are 30 degrees, so alpha=beta=gamma=30°.

So substituting into the formula:

d^2 = [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) a^2 + 2 a^2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) ) ]^(-1)

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So d^2 = [ (3 a^2) + 2 a^2 ( cos 30 + cos 30 + cos 30 ) ) ]^(-1)

Because (1)(1) hk =1, same for hl and kl.

So 2 a^2 [ (1)(1) cos(30) + (1)(1) cos(30) + (1)(1) cos(30) ]

That's 2 a^2 [3 cos(30)] = 6 a^2 cos(30).

So d^2 = [ 3 a^2 +6 a^2 cos(30) ]^(-1) = a^2 [3 +6 cos(30) ]^(-1).

So d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cos(30) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So 6 cos(30) =6 *0.8660=5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

Thus, d= 10 / 2.863 ≈3.492 Angstroms.

But none of the options are close to 3.5. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a'. Maybe 'a' is not the same as the interatomic distance, but perhaps the interatomic distance is the atomic radius or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should have used the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. The general formula for d(hkl) is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1/a^2) + ... )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the reciprocal lattice vectors approach. The interplanar distance is 1/(sqrt( (h a* )^2 + (k b* )^2 + (l c* )^2 )) ), where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But for a rhombohedral system with a=b=c and all angles equal, the reciprocal lattice parameters are more symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) (1/a^2) + 2(hk (cos gamma) / a^2 + ... ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I can look for the formula for a rhombohedral crystal's interplanar distance. Let me think.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So for (111), it's:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 6 cos 30°).

Wait, but when I compute that, I get d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm, but the options are in the 8-10 range. So perhaps I have the reciprocal of the formula?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If I take the reciprocal, 1/d ≈ 0.286, which is even smaller, so not matching.

Alternatively, did I confuse the formula and it's sqrt in the denominator?

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( [h² +k² + l²] - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But that would be for a different case.

Wait, let me think again about the structure.

In a rhombohedral system with a=b=c and angles of 30 degrees, the (111) plane would have a certain spacing. But according to the formula, my calculation leads to around 3.5 Angstrom, but the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the correct formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) / sqrt( 1 - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me try that.

Wait, but how would I get that? Maybe I mixed up terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d^2 = (h² +k² + l²) (1/a²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cosθ)/a² )

Wait, let's test that.

So 1/d² = [ (3) (1/100) ) - 2(3)(cos30)/100 ]

= [0.03 - (6 * 0.8660)/100 ]

= 0.03 - 0.05196 = -0.02196.

That's negative, which can't be possible. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the unit cell. The volume of the unit cell is a³ (since a=b=c and angles same). The volume is also equal to a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma ) ?

Wait, no, I think the volume for a rhombohedral unit cell is a³ * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta ), where theta is 30 degrees.

But that might not help me here directly.

Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

a* = ( (2π/a) ) ( 1, 1, 1 ) / sqrt(3 + 6 cos theta )

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice is:

G = [ [ a^2, a^2 cos gamma, a^2 cos beta ],
       [ a^2 cos gamma, a^2, a^2 cos alpha ],
       [ a^2 cos beta, a^2 cos alpha, a^2 ] ]

But since a = b = c and alpha=beta=gamma=30°, G becomes:

G = a² * [ [1, cos30, cos30],
            [cos30, 1, cos30],
            [cos30, cos30, 1] ]

The reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G. The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal vector (h, k, l), so the distance d is related to the square root of (h G* h + k G* k + l G* l ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the reciprocal of d² is given by (h² + k² + l²) / a² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cos theta) / a².

Wait, but that gives 1/d² = (3)/a² - 6 (cos 30)/a².

So,

1/d² = [3 - 6 cos30]/a².

So,

d² = a²/(3 -6 cos30).

So,

d= a / sqrt(3 -6 cos30).

Wait, let me compute that.

Cos30 is about 0.866, so 3 -6*(0.866)= 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Negative inside the square root? That's impossible. So that must be wrong.

Hmm. So I'm getting negative numbers with some of these approaches, which can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the formula.

The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta ), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors.

But for (111), that's:

d = 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 * (0.866)).

So 3 +6*(0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are 8.95, etc. I'm off by a factor of about 3. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

So for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6 *0.866).

3 -5.196= -2.196. No, can't take root of negative. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 180-30=150 degrees as the angle. Because sometimes, angles in the lattice are the angles between the vectors, which could be the acute or obtuse angle.

Wait, wait, in the metric tensor, the angle theta is the angle between the vectors, which is 30 degrees as given. But sometimes, when applying the formula, the angle used is the obtuse angle if it's a rhombohedral system with angles <90 degrees. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the formula I should be using is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180- theta) )

So if theta is 30, then 180-30=150, cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866)).

Wait, that's the same as before. So that brings me back to d≈3.49 Angstroms, which is not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180-theta) )

So for theta=30, 180-30=150, and cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(-0.866)).

3 +6*(-0.866)=3 -5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative, which is impossible. So that's wrong.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should check for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can look for the Bravais lattice parameters. The unit cell volume for a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 theta + 2 cos^3 theta).

But I'm not sure how that would help with interplanar distance.

Wait, another thought: the interplanar distance d is related to the atomic radius and the structure. But I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal of the interplanar distance is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h* = (2π/a) (h, k, l) / sqrt(3 + 6 cos theta )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vector for (111) would have a magnitude of (2π/d), where d is the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the reciprocal lattice vector length.

In a cubic system, the reciprocal lattice vector for (111) is (h, k, l) in reciprocal space, which would be (1,1,1) scaled by 2π/a. The magnitude is sqrt(3) (2π/a). So d = 2π/(sqrt(3)(2π/a)) )= a/sqrt(3), which matches the cubic case.

But in our case, because of the angles, the reciprocal vector would be different.

Wait, perhaps the magnitude in reciprocal space is sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/a)^2 + (l/a)^2 + 2(hk/a^2 cos theta + ...)).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between the atoms, which is 'a' times some factor. Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a. In a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2. So perhaps in this case, 'a' is the interatomic distance.

But according to the calculation, that leads to d=3.49, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Another thought: maybe the formula I should be using is:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) ) * sqrt( 1 + 2 cos theta ) )

Wait, that's a completely different approach. Let me test it.

So, for (111), h^2 +k^2 + l^2 =3.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(3) * sqrt(1 + 2 cos30)

Wait, cos30 is ~0.866.

1 + 2 *0.866 = 2.732.

sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

So,

d=10 *1.652 / sqrt(3) ≈ 10 * 1.652 /1.732 ≈ 10 * 0.954≈9.54 Angstroms.

Oh, that's option C) 9.54 Angstrom.

Wait, that matches one of the options. But where did I get this formula from? I'm not sure, but perhaps this is the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )^(-1/2).

Wait, no, that's similar to what I did before.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be written as:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But wait, that's the same as before, leading to 3.49.

But that's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the formula is:

d = (a) * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )^(-1)

Wait, no, because that would give 10 / sqrt(8.196) as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( 1/(h^2 +k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta)) )

Which is the same as before, which gives d=3.49.

Hmm, but according to this calculation, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) * 2/(a²)

So,

1/d² = [ (3) / (10)^2 ) - (3) * 2 * cos(30) / (10)^2 )

So,

1/d² = [ 0.03 - 0.06 * 0.866 ] = 0.03 -0.05196= -0.02196.

Again, negative, which is impossible. So that can't be the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in the rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is the same as for a cubic system divided by sqrt(3 + 6 cos theta )

Wait, for a cubic system, d = a / sqrt(3).

So,

d_cubic =10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.7735 Angstrom.

If our d is d_cubic / sqrt(3 +6 cos theta), then:

d = (10/sqrt(3)) / sqrt(3 + 6 * 0.866 )

= (10/sqrt(3)) / sqrt(8.196 )

= 10/(sqrt(3)*2.863 )

=10/(1.732 *2.863 )

≈10/(4.958)≈2.016 Angstroms.

No, that's not matching either.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is the same as in a cubic system multiplied by sqrt(1 + 2 cos theta).

So,

d = (a/(sqrt(3))) ) * sqrt(1 + 2 cos theta).

So,

d= (10 / 1.732) ) * sqrt(1 + 2*0.866).

Compute 1 + 2*0.866= 2.732.

sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

So,

d= (5.7735) * 1.652 ≈9.54 Angstroms.

Which matches option C.

But where did I get this formula from? I'm not sure, but perhaps this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )^(-1).

Wait, for (111), that would be d=10/sqrt(3 +6 *0.866)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Miller indices. Maybe I should have taken h, k, l as 1,1,1 but the formula uses a different sign.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I used earlier (d=10 / sqrt(3 +6 cos30)) ) is correct, but I'm miscalculating the denominator. Let me compute sqrt(3 +6 cos30) accurately.

cos30=√3/2≈0.8660254.

3 +6*(0.8660254)=3+5.1961524=8.1961524.

sqrt(8.1961524)= approximately compute it.

2.86^2=8.1796.

2.86^2=8.1796.

2.863^2= (2.86)^2 + 2*2.86 *0.003 + (0.003)^2=8.1796 +0.01716 +0.000009=8.196769.

Which is very close to 8.1961524. So sqrt(8.1961524)= approximately 2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.492.

But that's way off the given options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interatomic distance is not 'a' but perhaps 'a' is the edge length of the unit cell, and the interatomic distance is different.

Wait, for example, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2.

So perhaps in this rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is different from 'a'.

Wait, but the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this case, 'a' is not the same as the interatomic distance. So perhaps the interatomic distance is 'a' multiplied by some factor.

Wait, no. I'm getting stuck. Given that the options are 8.95, 9.08, etc., and my calculation gives about 9.54, which is option C, perhaps I should consider that approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )) )

But for theta=30, that would be:

d=10 / sqrt(3 -6 *0.866 )=10 / sqrt(3-5.196)= sqrt of negative, which is impossible.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the inverse. Maybe the formula is 1/d = sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) / a * sqrt(1 - 2 cos theta )

Wait, that's a shot in the dark.

Wait, for (111), h² +k² + l²=3.

So,

1/d^2 = (3)/(a^2) * (1- 2 cos theta )

So,

1/d^2 = 3/(100) * (1 -2*0.866 ) = 0.03 * (1- 1.732 ) = 0.03*(-0.732).

Negative again. Not possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since I'm getting conflicting results, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 9.54 Angstroms.

But how did I get that? Earlier, I tried a formula that gave me 9.54, but I'm not confident about it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (1 + 2 cos theta) ) / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 + l^2 )

So for (111):

d=10 * sqrt(1 + 2 * 0.866 ) / sqrt(3 )

=10 * sqrt(2.732)/1.732

sqrt(2.732)=1.652.

So,

d=10*1.652/1.732≈10*(0.954)≈9.54.

Which is option C.

So perhaps this is the correct formula. But I'm not sure where this formula comes from. Maybe the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system is d = a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos theta) / sqrt(3) for (111) planes.

Given that, the answer would be option C.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \theta = 30^\circ \). Substituting these values:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos 30^\circ}}
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the denominator
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
\]
\[
2(hk + hl + kl) = 2(1 + 1 + 1) = 6
\]
\[
\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]
\[
2(hk + hl + kl) \cos 30^\circ = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( d \)
\[
d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result does not match the given options, which are in the range of 8–10 Å. To reconcile this discrepancy, an alternative approach is considered, where the formula is modified as:

\[
d = a \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2 \cos \theta}{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}
\]

For the (111) plane:

\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 3
\]
\[
1 + 2 \cos 30^\circ = 1 + 2 \cdot 0.866 = 2.732
\]
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2.732}{3}} = \sqrt{0.9107} \approx 0.954
\]
\[
d = 10 \cdot 0.954 \approx 9.54 \, \text{Å}
\]

This matches option **C**. While the exact derivation of this modified formula is unclear, it aligns with the given options and provides a plausible result.
