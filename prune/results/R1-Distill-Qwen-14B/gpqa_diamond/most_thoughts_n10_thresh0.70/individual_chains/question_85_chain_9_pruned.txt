Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

So, there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii: Planet1 is 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii, Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question is about their equilibrium temperatures. The options are ratios, so I need to find T_eq1 divided by T_eq2 or vice versa.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, but wait, let's think. The formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The exact formula is:

T_eq = T_eff * ( L / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4)

But since L (luminosity) is proportional to R_star² * T_eff^4 (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law), substituting that in:

T_eq = T_eff * [ (R_star² T_eff^4) / (16πσ a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, let me simplify that. L = 4π R_star² σ T_eff^4. So substituting into T_eq:

T_eq = T_eff * [ (4π R_star² σ T_eff^4) / (16πσ a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify the inside of the bracket:

4π /16π = 1/4. σ cancels. So:

= [ ( R_star² T_eff^4 ) / (4 a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which is T_eff * ( R_star² / (4 a²) )^(1/4 )

Wait, T_eff is the star's T_eff. So:

T_eq = T_eff * ( R_star² / (4 a²) )^(1/4 )

Which can be written as T_eq = T_eff * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2 )

So, T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star ) / sqrt(2 a ) * T_eff.

But wait, R_star is the star's radius, which is given as 1.2 R_sun. So, for both planets, R_star is the same. So, the main variables are the semi-major axes, a.

Wait, but the question gives data about the Doppler shifts. How do I find the semi-major axes of the planets?

The radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift due to the star's motion. The semi-amplitude K of the RV curve is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator simplifies. But wait, I don't have the orbital periods or the inclination angle. Hmm.

Wait, but the question gives the Doppler shifts for each planet. The shifts are in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. I think this is the semi-amplitude K of the RV, which is in velocity units. Since the Doppler shift is in wavelength, I can convert that to velocity.

The Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So, the semi-amplitude K is v = c * (Δλ / λ)

Where λ is the rest wavelength, which is 6300 Å. For Planet1, Δλ is 0.03 Å, so K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300 )

Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04 / 6300 )

But I need to relate K to the semi-major axis a. Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but I don't have the period. Hmm, but I can relate the period to the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³) / (G(M_star + M_planet))

Since M_planet << M_star, it's approx P² = (4π² a³ )/( G M_star )

But without knowing P, perhaps I can find the ratio of a1 to a2 by using their RV semi-amplitudes.

Let me think: K is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a, because K = (v) = (2π a sin
