Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) at Paranal. It's supposed to be high-resolution, right? But the question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel for a 1-hour exposure. The threshold is S/N of 10 per pixel.

So each star's detectability depends on its brightness as seen from Earth. The brighter the star, the higher the S/N because more photons are detected. But wait, the stars here have different absolute magnitudes and distances, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes to see how bright they appear in our sky.

Absolute magnitude (M) is the brightness a star would have at 10 parsecs away. Apparent magnitude (m) depends on the distance (d) in parsecs. The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10). Alternatively, m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, let me get that right. The formula is m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1), which is the same as m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

So for each star, I'll calculate m using this formula. The lower the m, the brighter the star (since lower magnitudes are brighter).

The stars given are:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with M=15, d=10 pc
d) M=15, d=200 pc
e) M=15, d=5 pc
f) M=15, d=50 pc

Wait, but for a and b, I need to find their apparent magnitudes. Let me recall what their absolute magnitudes are.

Canopus is a very bright star. I think it's a first-magnitude star. Let me check: Canopus is about magnitude -0.7, but wait, that's apparent magnitude. Oh wait, no, wait. No, I'm confused. Wait, I'll try to remember. Canopus is the brightest star in the southern skies. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.7, but absolute magnitude is lower. Wait no, the absolute magnitude is the magnitude it would have at 10pc. So a bright star at a distance would have a lower (more negative) absolute magnitude.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, higher absolute magnitude means dimmer. So Canopus is very bright, so its absolute magnitude must be low. Let me think: I think Canopus has an absolute magnitude around -5.5. Wait, maybe I should look up, but since this
