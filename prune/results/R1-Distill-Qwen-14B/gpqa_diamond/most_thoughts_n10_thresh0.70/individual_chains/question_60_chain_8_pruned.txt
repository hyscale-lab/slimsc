Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years, which is way longer than humans. They're sending an astronaut who's 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective. The options given are about the time experienced by the astronaut, not the time we on Earth would see.

Wait, so the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifespan is 150 years. So for them, if the trip takes more than around 128 years (since 150 minus 22 is 128), they might not survive. But I'm not sure yet.

The question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, right? So this is a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation. Time dilation occurs because when you're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, your experienced time (proper time) is less than the time measured in the stationary frame.

But wait, wait. Let's think about frames. The spacecraft is moving relative to Earth, so from Earth's frame, the trip takes a certain amount of time. But from the astronaut's frame, due to their high speed, less time passes. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall the time dilation formula.

The formula is: proper time (τ) is equal to the time in the moving frame (the astronaut's frame) and is given by τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in the Earth's frame, and v is the velocity of the spacecraft.

Wait, but sometimes it's easier to calculate the distance as seen from Earth and then see how much time passes on Earth, and then apply the time dilation. Alternatively, use the Lorentz factor.

First, I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth, but wait, the problem doesn't give specific distances. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance is approximately 160,000 light-years. Wait, but the problem doesn't give a specific distance, so perhaps I need to make an assumption. Wait the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut," so it's about the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified, assuming the distance is such that the time according to Earth is t, and the astronaut's time is t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to compute the gamma factor.

Let me compute the gamma factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Given v = 0.99999987 * c. So (v/c) is 0.99999987. Let me square this. So (v²/c²) = (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute this. Let's approximate 0.99999987 as (1 - 1.3e-7). Wait, no, wait, 1 - 1.3e-7 is 0.99999987? Let me check: 1 - 1e-7 is 0.9999999, but 0.99999987 is 0.99999987, so it's 1 - 1.3e-7? Wait, 1.3e-7 is 0.00000013. Subtracting that from 1 gives 0.99999987.

So, (v/c)^2 = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. Because (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible compared to that.

So, 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute that. sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, 1
