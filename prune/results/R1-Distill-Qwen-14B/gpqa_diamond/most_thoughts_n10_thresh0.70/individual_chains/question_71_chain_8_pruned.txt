Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. But wait, the problem says the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a certain ratio. Oh right, the TTV method detects planets by the gravitational interactions causing variations in timing, but the key here is their orbital periods.

The periods are given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. I need to find the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. 

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula, right? I think it's something like T = T_eff * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe simpler: the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, it's proportional to (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but if all planets are around the same star, L and σ are constants, so it's inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (since d is a). Or wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4
