Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T(NN)=0, and I need to determine which partial wave is not allowed.

Wait, wait. Let me break this down. So the initial state is 1S0. The 1 in 1S0 usually denotes the spin state. So S=0 because it's S state, and the 1 comes from 2S+1 = 1 → S=0. Oh wait, no, 1S0: 2S+1 =1 → S=0? But wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So 1S0 would have 2S+1=1 → S=0, L=0 (since it's S), and J=0.

Wait, but that can't be right because two nucleons (like two protons or a proton and neutron) have some spin. Oh, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. For two nucleons, their spin state can be S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). So 1S0 would mean that the total spin S is 0, and the orbital angular momentum L is 0 since it's an S state. So the total angular momentum J is 0, since J = L + S, and both are zero. So the initial state is J=0, S=0, L=0.

Now, they emit a particle X. So the system after emission is the NN system plus the emitted particle X. Wait no, the problem says the NN is the final state, so I think the X is emitted, so the initial state is NN, and the final state is NN plus X. Or wait, is it that the NN system emits X, so the state is NN plus X? Or maybe the question is considering the decay of the initial NN state into a different state plus X.

Wait, the question says "emit a particle X", so the initial state is the NN system (bound), and the final state is the same NN system plus X? Or maybe the NN system breaks into something else and X. No, more accurately, the NN system is emitting a particle X, so the final state is NN plus X. So the initial state is the NN (bound) in 1S0, and the final state is the NN system in some state plus X. Hmm, but the problem says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So perhaps the NN system after emission is in a different state, and X is emitted.

But maybe I should focus on the conservation laws. The problem mentions that both angular momentum and parity must be conserved. Also, the Pauli exclusion principle is about the overall wavefunction symmetry.

Wait, the Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L + 1 modulo 2. Since the final state has T=0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L have opposite parity. Hmm, okay.

Now, the options given are about the angular momentum state of X. So each option is of the form 1S0 → something + particle, like 7D1 + p. Hmm, so each option shows the initial state and the final state of the NN system plus the particle X emitted.

Wait, let me clarify: the initial state is 1S0 (NN), and the final state is some NN state plus X. So the process is NN (1S0) → NN (some state) + X.

Wait, but the question says "the final NN state has T(NN)=0." So the NN in the final state must have T=0. So the X is what is emitted.

Now, considering that particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The total parity before and after must be the same, as parity is conserved in strong interactions (assuming this is an electromagnetic or strong process, but I think
