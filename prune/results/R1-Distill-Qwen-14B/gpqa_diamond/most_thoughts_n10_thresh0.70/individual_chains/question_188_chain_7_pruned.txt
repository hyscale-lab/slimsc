Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think through it carefully. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me jot down what I remember and try to work through it step by step.

First, I know that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor, which is d = a / (sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ)), but wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Oh wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the crystal plane vector. So, maybe I should think about using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, I remember that for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, all the angles are equal, right? So
