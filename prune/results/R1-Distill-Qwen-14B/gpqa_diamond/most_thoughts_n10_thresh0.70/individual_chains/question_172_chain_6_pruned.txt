Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution from my studies. Let me try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the Boltzmann equation applies here.

I think the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. But wait, since star_1 has twice as many excited atoms, N2 for star_1 is 2 times N2 for star_2? Or am I getting that mixed up?

Wait, no. Let's clarify. Let me denote star_1 as having a higher excitation level. Suppose the excited state is level 2 and the lower state is level 1. So N2 is the number of atoms in level 2, and N1 in level 1. For star_1, N2_1 / N1_1 = 2, because they're twice as excited. For star_2, N2_2 / N1_2 = something else, say x. But wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as star_2. So if star_2 has a ratio of R, star_1 has 2R? Or perhaps the actual ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio?

Wait, the exact wording says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think it means that the excitation (population) in the specific higher level is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So N2_1 = 2 * N2_2. But wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the ratio of N2 to
