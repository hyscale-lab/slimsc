Okay, so I have this question about organic compounds and the light they emit. Hmm, it's a multiple-choice question, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think about what I remember from my chemistry classes.

The question says that a textile dye with extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color of light is absorbed. The options are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Wait, I remember something about the energy of light and the electromagnetic spectrum. I think higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths, which are towards the violet end of the spectrum, and lower energy is longer wavelengths, like red.

Oh right, the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength.

But wait, when a compound emits light, that's fluorescence or something like that. But the question is about the absorbed light. Oh, because when a substance absorbs light, it emits it at a lower energy, right? Or wait, maybe not. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, conjugated pi-electrons... Oh, conjugated systems are involved in absorbing certain wavelengths of light. The more conjugated the system, the longer the wavelength (lower energy) of light it absorbs. Because longer λ means lower energy since E is inversely proportional.

So, if the compound emits light at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the emitted photon. But the absorbed light would be higher in energy, because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then emits a photon when it relaxes. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed one. Because when the molecule is excited to a higher energy state, it emits a photon when it goes back to a lower state. So the emitted photon's energy is the difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy, gets excited to a higher state, and then when it relaxes, emits a photon of lower energy. So the emitted light has lower energy than the absorbed.

But the question isn't directly about that. It says the dye emits light at that energy. So the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So that's the energy of the emitted light. But what does that mean about the absorbed light?

Wait
