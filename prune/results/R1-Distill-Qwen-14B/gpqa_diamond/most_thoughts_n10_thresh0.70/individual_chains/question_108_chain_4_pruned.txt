Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They also mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. So I'm assuming m is like m=0, 1, 2, etc., but small. 

The problem asks to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers.

I remember that the transition energy ΔE corresponds to the energy difference between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom. The wavelength λ is given, so I can probably calculate ΔE using the relation E = hc/λ. Let me compute that first.

Wait, the wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. That's in the visible range, actually. I think that's the Balmer series, maybe the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=3 to n=2. So the energy of that photon would be ΔE.

Calculating ΔE: Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9 m). Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.088e-19 J. Hmm, wait, but I think I should convert that to electron volts because often in atomic physics, energies are given in eV. Oh wait, the question just asks for magnitude comparison, so maybe I can keep it in joules for now.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic effect arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of electrons with an external magnetic field. The energy due to this interaction is given by the Zeeman effect. The formula for the energy shift is ΔE_mag = μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -g * μ_B * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, in the paramagnetic coupling, I think we're considering the orbital magnetic moment as well, but the problem specifies "paramagnetic coupling term", which I think refers to the spin-orbit interaction, but wait no, maybe it refers to the Zeeman effect splitting due to the external field.

Wait, no, the paramagnetic coupling term is the term in the Hamiltonian due to the external magnetic field interacting with the magnetic moment. So the Zeeman term is H = -μ·B, but for the energy, it would be proportional to m * B, where m is the magnetic quantum number (or rather, the z-component of the magnetic moment).

Wait, no, more accurately, the energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = -m * μ_B * B, where m is the magnetic quantum number (for the orbital part, maybe, but if it's paramagnetic, perhaps it's the spin part? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, paramagnetic materials have electrons with unpaired spins; their magnetic moments are due to spin, not orbital motion. Oh, right! So the paramagnetic coupling term would be due to the spin magnetic moment interacting with B.

So the magnetic moment for spin is μ = g_s * μ_B * m_s, where m_s is ±1/2. So the energy shift would be ΔE = -μ·B = -g_s μ_B m_s B.

So the magnitude would be proportional to g_s μ_B B.

Wait, but the question says "small values of m", which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in the context of the Zeeman effect, m refers to the orbital m_l, or the spin m_s? Hmm, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, and m_l can be -l to +l. So for small m, perhaps m is small, like m=0 or 1. But I'm not exactly sure how that plays into this comparison.

Wait, the question says "parallel to Oz", so maybe the direction is along the z-axis, and m is the m_l value, but perhaps the paramagnetic term is about the spin, which has m_s = ±1/2. So perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term is for the spin, regardless of the orbital m.

Wait, but the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from unpaired electrons, so their spin magnetic moments. So the Zeeman energy shift due to spin would be ΔE = -μ_B * m_s * B * g_s.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. Let me compute the magnitude of this term.

So let's plug in the numbers: μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. m_s can be ±1/2. So the energy shift would be about 9.274e-24 J/T *
