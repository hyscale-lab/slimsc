Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator. The question gives me H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and each is a 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually written as vectors, so σ · n would be the dot product, right? So that would expand to σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. And each of these components is multiplied by the corresponding component of the unit vector n.

I'm trying to recall what the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix look like. Oh wait, each Pauli matrix (like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But in this case, the Hamiltonian isn't just a single Pauli matrix; it's a combination of all three. So I'm not sure if the same eigenvalues apply.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are all traceless and have determinant -I. So they each have eigenvalues ±1. But when you take a linear combination like this, what happens?

Wait, maybe I can think of
