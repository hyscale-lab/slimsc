Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each, and then match them with the options A, B, C, or D.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

Wait, what's a Michael addition? Oh right, it's a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

So in part A, dimethyl malonate is the donor. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in Michael reactions, the donor is usually a nucleophilic enolate, and the acceptor is the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. It's a diester and can form an enolate when deprotonated.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the E configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on either side are a methyl ester and a p-tolyl group on opposite sides.

So the reaction should be a Michael addition where the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated acceptor. The product would be a new carbon chain.

Let's draw it mentally. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOH)2, but as the ester, it's (CH3O)2C-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. So when deprotonated at the alpha position, the enolate is formed. The enolate's structure would have a negative charge on the central carbon.

When the enolate attacks the beta position of the acrylate, which is the CH2 part. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the structure is more like CH2=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, no. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 with a substituent on the double bond. Wait, no. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be substituent on the CH2 part? Wait, the numbering is a bit tricky. Hmm.

Wait, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Carbon
