Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

Okay, the question has three parts, each a Michael addition reaction. Each part has reactants and conditions, and we need to find the major products. Then, we look at the options to match them.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position in an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The nucleophile here would be the enolate from the malonate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. It's symmetric, so the attack can happen on either side, but in this case, the other component is the acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate). The E geometry would mean the substituents are opposite. So the structure is CH2-CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be at the alpha position? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, the structure might be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, wait, I think I messed that up. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? No, wait, the numbering might be different. Oh wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, and the substituent is on the middle carbon (the beta position). Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that can't be right. Maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C
