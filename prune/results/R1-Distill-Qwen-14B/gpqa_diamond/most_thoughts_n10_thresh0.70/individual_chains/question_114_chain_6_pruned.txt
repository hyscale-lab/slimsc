Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with some reagent A, leading to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via nucleophilic substitution. So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is methylacetone or (CH3)2CO) is reacting with NaCN. I think that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's usually under some specific conditions. Maybe acidic conditions? Because I recall that the formation of nitriles from ketones often involves a acid catalyst.

Wait, so butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives this hydroxy nitrile. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure: the starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would substitute the carbonyl oxygen. But wait, a ketone has a carbonyl group. So the reaction is probably a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN-.

But wait, ketones usually don't undergo nucleophilic substitution easily under normal conditions. Oh! Right, I think this is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the reaction is acid-catalyzed.

So reagent A must be an acid. Looking at the options, the possible A's are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, like sulfuric acid. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid. Wait, but in the context of cyanohydrin formation, the usual catalyst is a strong acid, like H2SO4, which would provide H+ and SO4^2- as the counterion. So that would correspond to A being H3O+.

So for reagent A,
