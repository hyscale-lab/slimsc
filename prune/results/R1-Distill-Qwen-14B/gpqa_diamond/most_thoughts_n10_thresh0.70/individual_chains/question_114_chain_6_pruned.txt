Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions.

The problem has two parts, right? The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes that product and uses reagent B (with water) to make 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, no, the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it goes to the corresponding butanoic acid. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let me focus on each part one by one.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's acetone. When acetone reacts with NaCN, what happens? I remember that in the presence of a base, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. Wait, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, adding CN- to a ketone. Normally, without any other reagents, a ketone might not react with CN- because the carbonyl is not very reactive. Oh but wait, sometimes in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe? Or perhaps a base. Wait, wait—no, I think for the addition of HCN to a ketone, you typically use a base. Wait, but in this case, it's NaCN, which is a salt. So perhaps, the reaction is a nucleophilic addition where the CN- acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, but wait a second. Another possibility is the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a nitrile in the presence of an acid catalyst. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

So, the reaction of a ketone with a nitrile might form a cyanohydrin. Let me think: the general
