Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about a star whose surface is partially covered by dark spots. When the spots aren't there, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is assumed to be in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium).

Hmm, okay. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of these levels to temperature. The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is the energy of each level, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So, the effective temperature when there are spots is 5500 K, and without spots it's 6000 K. But wait, wait, I think I need to be careful here. The star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K when the spots are present. Only 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler. The rest is at 6000 K. So, the overall or average Teff is 5500 K. But for the photosphere, does that mean the temperature we're using is the effective temperature, or the temperature in the unspotted regions?

Wait, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." Hmm. So, the effective temperature is 5500 K when considering the entire surface, which is a mix of spots and unspotted areas. But for the photosphere, the regions without spots are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are cooler. But when the spots are present, the average Teff is lower.

But when looking at the ratio of Ti atoms, which part are we considering? The problem says "in the stellar photosphere", so maybe the photosphere is the entire surface, but the presence of spots affects the overall emission. Wait, but LTE says that each region is in local equilibrium, so each spot's photosphere is at a lower temperature, and the unspotted regions are at 6000 K.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So, the star's photosphere isn't uniform in temperature
