Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and there are a series of reactions happening. I need to figure out the final product after these reactions. The options are A to D.

First, I should try to determine the structure of the initial compound based on the NMR data. Let's look at the NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet at around 9.7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, could it be something else like an acidic proton, maybe from a phenol? No, phenol protons are usually lower, around 5-8 ppm. So maybe it's an aldehyde.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet. This could be from aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted phenyl groups? Because in para substitution, you get two sets of doublets. Or perhaps adjacent protons in a coupling scenario.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, same as above. So if the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, perhaps the molecule has two aromatic rings with substituents that cause this splitting. Wait, but I only see two sets of doubletsâ€”maybe each ring has two protons each, like in para positions.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests perhaps exchange with something, like an NH group or an OH group. But wait, this is a singlet, so no splitting. But in the product, after reaction, maybe something changes. Hmm, could this be an NH group from an amine? Or maybe an OH that's exchanging rapidly, making it a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of an enol form or something else.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, 2H. This is in the range for CH2 groups. Maybe a CH2 next to an oxygen, like an ether or an
