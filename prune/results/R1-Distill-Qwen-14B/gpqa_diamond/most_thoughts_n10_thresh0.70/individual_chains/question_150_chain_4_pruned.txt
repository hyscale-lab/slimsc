Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation first. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO, substituting:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 + 2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I did the formula wrong. Oh wait, right, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is halogens, which in this case, there are none. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's probably from a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde group (since O is involved? Wait no, maybe a ring and a double bond plus a carbonyl. Let me think.

Looking at the NMR data. The peaks are:

9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons typically appear around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but wait, aldehydes usually only have one proton, so the triplet might be from coupling with adjacent protons, like maybe in an enal (like an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde).

Then at 6.98 ppm, a doublet integrating to 2H. That could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring. The downfield shift suggests some electron-withdrawing groups nearby, but maybe it's just para substitution.

6.51 ppm, another doublet, 2H. Maybe another set of aromatic protons adjacent to substituents.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like -OH protons? Or maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like vinyl protons. Wait, but a singlet, so no splittingâ€”so maybe they're in a conjugated diene or something.

3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group attached to something deshielded but not too electronegative. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group or a carbonyl. But wait, the doublet suggests coupling with one proton each. So maybe it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl or something.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted aromatic compound with an aldehyde group and some substituents. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: benzene rings are 6 carbons. So if there's a benzene ring, perhaps two substituents on it. But wait, the formula is
