Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about figuring out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure. The benzene ring has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering rings can be tricky. Let me sketch it out mentally. Let's say position 1 is the ethoxy group, position 2 is the tert-butyl group, and position 3 is the nitro group. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So the ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in 2, and nitro in 3. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,3 in a specific order.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering can be such that the substituents are as close as possible. But regardless, the key is to figure out the order of reactions to get all three groups attached in the correct order to maximize the yield.

So the starting material is benzene. The target has tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. These are
