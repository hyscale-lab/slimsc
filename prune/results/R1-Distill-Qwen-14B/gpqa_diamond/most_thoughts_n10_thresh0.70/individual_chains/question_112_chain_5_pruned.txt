Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and then finding the average value of an operator.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think I need to normalize this state first because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes. Wait, but the question says it's proportional, so maybe I have to normalize it. Right, because the sum of probabilities must be 1.

So, the state is |alpha> = c(1+i)|up> + c(2-i)|down>, but wait, the original says it's proportional, so maybe the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), but I need to find the normalization constant. Oh wait, no, perhaps the state is already expressed as a linear combination, and I need to compute the normalization factor.

So, the normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So, I'll compute the inner product.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)*c^* (for |up>) times (1-i) because when you take the conjugate of (1+i), you get (1-i). Similarly, for (2-i), its conjugate is (2+i). So, I think the calculation would be:

(1+i) and (2-i) are the coefficients. So, the normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of their magnitudes.

Wait, the magnitude squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. And for (2-i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(7). So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, but the initial state is proportional, so that makes sense. So the coefficients after normalization are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2-i)/sqrt(7).

So, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about the operator whose matrix representation Aij is given. The matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Wait, in a two-level system, the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Let me think: The Pauli X matrix has ones off the diagonal and zeros on the diagonal. But in this case, the matrix A has A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, so for a 2x2 matrix, A would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, but wait, maybe it's for a different basis. Oh,
