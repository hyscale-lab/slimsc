Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, but here I think it's a two-dimensional metric since it's in terms of dx² and dy². 

Wait, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So that looks like a line element in two dimensions. But what kind of geometry does this describe? I think this might be a hyperbolic space because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which reminds me of the form you see in hyperbolic coordinates. Or maybe it's a sphere with some scaling? Wait, no, the denominator is subtracting x² and y², but the overall sign might change things.

Wait, when you have a term like (4 - x² - y²) in the denominator, it could represent a region where 4 - x² - y² is positive, which would mean x² + y² < 4. So that's a circle of radius 2, right? So the domain of this metric is the disk where x² + y² < 4. But what about the other part, the 32 over that denominator multiplied by (dx² + dy²). That makes me think of a conformal metric because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric. Conformal metrics usually describe spaces that are locally like Euclidean but scaled by some function.

So, the area element in such a metric would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is a 2D metric, the determinant would be the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy² minus the cross terms. But in this case, the cross terms are zero because the metric is diagonal. So the determinant is simply (32/(4 - x² - y²))²?

Wait, no, wait. The metric tensor g has components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy = 0. So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))², where r² is x² + y². But wait, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So that would be (32
