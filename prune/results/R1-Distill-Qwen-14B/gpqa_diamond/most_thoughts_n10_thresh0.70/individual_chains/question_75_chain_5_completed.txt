Okay, so I've got this question here about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to walk through it step by step.

So, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a construct where they've introduced a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected this into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they test the expression, they can't overexpress the protein as expected. They look at the plus strand sequence of their construct and find an issue. The options given are A to D, each suggesting a different problem.

Hmm, so the first thing I should do is look at the DNA sequence they provided and see if there's anything wrong with it. Since this is a coding sequence, it's mRNA that's going to be translated into protein. So I should probably check for any in-frame stop codons, issues with reading frames, or other anomalies.

Let me write down the coding sequence to see if I can spot any stop codons or other issues. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. Let's break it into triplets to see the amino acid sequence.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

Wait, wait, let me line them up in triplets. The initial part is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

Hmm, let me go through each triplet:

1. ATG: Methionine (start)
2. TAC: Tyrosine
3. CCA: Proline
4. TAC: Tyrosine
5. GAT: Aspartic acid
6. GGT: Glycine
7. TCC: Serine
8. AGA: Arginine
9. TTA: Leucine
10. CGC: Arginine
11. CAA: Glutamine
12. ATG: Methionine (another start codon)
13. ACT: Threonine
14. CTG: Leucine
15. GAA: Glutamic acid
16. GAA: Glutamic acid
17. TCC: Serine
18. GCC: Alanine
19. CGG: Arginine
20. ACA: Threonine
21. CAG: Glutamine
22. TTT: Phenylalanine
23. CC...

Wait a minute, at triplet 12, they have ATG again. That's another start codon. But the first ATG is the beginning. So in the middle, there's another ATG. So that would mean the ribosome might start translating there, creating a shorter protein. Or, more importantly, perhaps the initial ATG is followed by a stop codon before the next ATG?

Wait, let's check from the start.

The sequence after the first ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

So from the first ATG, the next codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG...

Wait, between the first ATG and the second ATG (at position 12), what's the sequence?

After ATG (1) comes TAC (2), then CCA (3), then TAC (4), etc., up to ATG at position 12. So that's 11 codons between the two ATGs. So the initial ATG is at position 1, and another ATG is at position 12. So in between, the coding sequence is 33 nucleotides (11 triplets), which is 33 bases, so that's okay.

Wait, but wait... if the ribosome starts at the first ATG, it will read the codons until it hits a stop codon. Let me check whether any of the codons between the first and second ATG are stop codons.

Looking through the triplet list from the first ATG:

1. ATG: start
2. TAC: Tyr
3. CCA: Pro
4. TAC: Tyr
5. GAT: Asp
6. GGT: Gly
7. TCC: Ser
8. AGA: Arg
9. TTA: Leu
10. CGC: Arg
11. CAA: Gln
12. ATG: another start codon

Wait, none of the first 11 codons (after the start) are stop codons. So the ribosome would keep going until it hits the second ATG as another start site. Or would it? No, the ribosome moves along, translating each codon. So if there's another ATG in the middle, the ribosome would continue past it, right? Because ATG is a start codon, but once a ribosome is translating, it doesn't necessarily stop unless there's a stop codon.

Wait, no. The ribosome is in the process of translation. It starts at the first ATG, translates each codon until it hits a stop codon (like UAA, UAG, or UGA). If there's another ATG in the middle, it doesn't stop because that's just another codon, unless it's a stop codon. So in this case, the second ATG (at position 12) is just a codon for methionine. So the ribosome would read through it and continue until it hits a stop codon.

So looking for any stop codons in the sequence. Let's check the rest.

Continuing:

12. ATG: Met (but it's in the middle)
13. ACT: Thr
14. CTG: Leu
15. GAA: Glu
16. GAA: Glu
17. TCC: Ser
18. GCC: Ala
19. CGG: Arg
20. ACA: Thr
21. CAG: Gln
22. TTT: Phe
23. CC... 

Wait, I'm going through each triplet, and I don't see any of the stop codons: UAA, UAG, or UGA. Because the nucleotides are given as the plus strand, which would be the non-template strand for mRNA, so mRNA would be complementary. Wait, no, wait: the coding sequence is written as the plus strand (same as mRNA except T for U). So when we look for stop codons, we have to look for the mRNA codons.

Wait, the sequence given is DNA on the plus strand, which is same as mRNA except T is U. So let me write a few codons in mRNA form. For example, triplet 2 is TAC in DNA, so mRNA would be AUG, which is methionine. Wait, wait, no, DNA is read as the coding (non-template) strand, so mRNA is complementary to the template strand. So for the DNA sequence provided, the mRNA is same as the DNA's coding strand, except T becomes U. So the mRNA would be the same as the DNA's plus strand, but with Us.

So, the DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

In mRNA, that would be:

AUG UAC CCA UAC GAC GGT TCC AGA UUA CGC CAA AUG ACU CTG GAA GAA UCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

Wait, but looking for stop codons, which are UAA, UAG, UGA.

Looking through the mRNA codons:

- After the first AUG (ATG), the next codon is UAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then UAC (Tyr), GAC (Asp), GGT (Gly), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), UUA (Leu), CGC (Arg), CAA (Gln), AUG (Met)... and so on.

Wait, at the 11th codon after the first AUG, we have another AUG (Met) at position 12. So the mRNA after the first AUG is:

1. AUG → Met
2. UAC → Tyr
3. CCA → Pro
4. UAC → Tyr
5. GAC → Asp
6. GGT → Gly
7. TCC → Ser
8. AGA → Arg
9. UUA → Leu
10. CGC → Arg
11. CAA → Gln
12. AUG → Met
13. ACU → Thr
14. CTG → Leu
15. GAA → Glu
16. GAA → Glu
17. UCC → Ser
18. GCC → Ala
19. CGG → Arg
20. ACA → Thr
21. CAG → Gln
22. TTT → Phe
23. CC...

Wait, the 23rd position is the 24th codon. Let's see if any of these are stop codons. So far, none until the end of the provided sequence.

Wait, the provided DNA sequence ends with ...CTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking at the last part, breaking into triplets:

...CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA CCT TCC GAG TGA3'

Wait, wait, let me parse that correctly.

Wait, the DNA sequence ends with ...GAGTGA3'.

So, the last few triplets would be:

CGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, let me split into triplets, making sure I'm grouping correctly. Let's see, perhaps it's better to count from the beginning.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for any in-frame stop codons in the mRNA sequence.

Wait, the DNA sequence provided ends with ...GAAGTGA3'.

So, the last few base pairs are GAG TGA.

Wait, in DNA, that's GAG and TGA.

In mRNA, that would be GAG and UGA. Because DNA's T becomes U in mRNA.

So, the last codon before the end would be UGA. UGA is a stop codon. Oh! That's a problem.

So, in the DNA sequence, the last triplet before the end is TGA. In mRNA, that's UGA, which is a stop codon. So, the construct has a stop codon (UGA) at the end.

Wait, but the sequence provided is the plus strand. So in the plus strand, the triplet is TGA, which in the mRNA (non-template strand) would be the same as the plus DNA strand, except T→U.

So, in the mRNA, the last codon is UGA, which is a stop. So the ribosome would terminate translation there. But wait, what's after that in the DNA? The DNA ends with ...GAGTGA3'—so the last triplet is GAG followed by TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the entire DNA sequence. The plus strand is written 5' to 3', so the mRNA is same as the plus strand's sequence, T→U.

So in the mRNA, the last codons would be ...CTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGUGA.

Wait, but the DNA ends with ...GAGTGA3', so the mRNA would have ...GAG UGA. So the last codon is UGA, which is a stop. So in that case, the mRNA would have a stop codon at the end. That's normal for the end of a gene.

But wait, the problem is that the person is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein with the HA tag. But in their construct, the coding sequence ends with a stop codon, which is normal. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the construct. They introduced the sequence for an HA determinant at the N-terminus. So the HA tag would be before the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but in the DNA sequence provided, the first codon is ATG, which is Met, so that would be the start of the HA tag? Or is the HA tag before that?

Wait, no, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the construct should have the HA tag coding sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

So in the DNA sequence, the first part should be the HA tag, then the GADD45G.

But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (Tyr), etc. So perhaps the HA tag is included in the first part. Wait, the HA antigen is a small peptide, right? So the sequence for HA would be maybe 6 amino acids. So let's see, the initial part of the DNA sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

Wait, the first 6 amino acids would be Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Gly. That doesn't look like the HA sequence. The HA antigen is from the influenza virus, and its sequence is YPYDVPDYD (if I remember correctly). So the HA coding sequence would be something like ATG TAC CCA TAT GAT GGT TCC ... etc. Wait, but in the given DNA, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC ...

Wait, maybe the HA coding sequence is the first part, which would then be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. So perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is not there, but that's not the case.

Wait, no. The issue is that the HA tag is introduced. So the construct should have the HA tag followed by the GADD45G gene. So the DNA sequence would start with HA's coding sequence, then GADD45G.

Wait, but in the given DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is methionine. So perhaps the HA tag is being expressed as part of this construct. Let me think. The HA tag's coding sequence would be a short sequence, perhaps about 6 codons (18 bases). So let me look at the start of the provided DNA sequence.

The first 18 bases are ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTC.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is part of the beginning. Let me think: the HA antigen is a small peptide, which is about 11 amino acids long. The coding sequence for HA would be ATG followed by the codons for each amino acid.

Wait, but the initial part here starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA... which is Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Gly, Ser, Arg, Leu, Arg, Gln, Met... Hmm, that doesn't correspond to the HA sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence is the first part, but the construct may have been incorrectly cloned. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is not correctly in frame, causing a stop codon early.

But in the provided DNA sequence, the construct doesn't have a stop codon until the end. Unless there's an in-frame stop codon earlier.

Wait, earlier I noticed that after the initial ATG, the 12th codon is another ATG. So that's a second start codon in the middle of the coding sequence. But that's not necessarily a problem unless it causes a frameshift or the ribosome to start translating again, leading to a shorter protein.

Wait, but the first ATG is the start, and the ribosome goes through the codons until it hits a stop. But in this case, the stop is at the end. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, looking again, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me count the number of nucleotides. The provided DNA sequence is 1026 bases long (counting each triplet as 3 bases). Let me see, 1026 /3 is 342 codons. So that's a long sequence.

Wait, but the problem is that when they tried to express it, they couldn't overexpress the protein. So the issue must be that the construct is not properly expressed. The options are A-D, suggesting possible issues.

Looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

So let's think about each option.

A) Missense mutation in HA determinant. That would change the amino acid, so the HA antibody may not recognize it. But the problem here is the lack of overexpression. If the HA is mutated, the protein might not be recognized, but the expression level would still be as much as possible. Unless the mutation caused a premature stop.

B) Ribosome stops early. That would mean the presence of a stop codon before the end. But in the DNA sequence, the stop codon is at the end with UGA. So the ribosome would stop at the end, as expected. So this option may not be correct.

Wait, unless there's an in-frame stop codon earlier. Let me scan the mRNA sequence for any UAA, UAG, or UGA codons.

Looking at the mRNA:

AUG UAC CCA UAC GAC GGT TCC AGA UUA CGC CAA AUG ACU CTG GAA GAA UCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

Wait, in the mRNA, the codons are:

1. AUG (start)
2. UAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. UAC (Tyr)
5. GAC (Asp)
6. GGT (Gly)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. UUA (Leu)
10. CGC (Arg)
11. CAA (Gln)
12. AUG (Met)
13. ACU (Thr)
14. CTG (Leu)
15. GAA (Glu)
16. GAA (Glu)
17. UCC (Ser)
18. GCC (Ala)
19. CGG (Arg)
20. ACA (Thr)
21. CAG (Gln)
22. TTT (Phe)
23. CC... (the rest continues)

Wait, looking for any UAA, UAG, UGA.

At position 9, UUA is Leu, not a stop.

At position 22, TTT is Phe. 

At the very end, the last codon is UGA (stop). So no other stops except at the end. Thus, the ribosome should translate the entire sequence until the end. So option B is unlikely because the ribosome doesn't terminate early.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. A linker sequence usually refers to a short amino acid sequence that protects the protein from proteases, like the ones rich in alanine or other non-browsable residues. If the construct doesn't have a linker, the protein might be degraded. But in this case, the problem is that the protein isn't expressed at all, not that it's being degraded. Unless the proteolysis happens so quickly that the protein is never detected. But the question says they couldn't overexpress it, so perhaps the issue is more about the construct not being translated.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon doesn't exist in mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon, and all organisms have mechanisms to recognize stop codons. So this is a bit confusing. If the mRNA has a UAA, which is a stop codon, but the mouse lacks the tRNA for UAA, that's not correct because tRNA doesn't recognize stop codons. Stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNA. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but in the DNA, the last triplet is TGA, which becomes UGA in mRNA. So the construct does have a stop codon at the end. So the ribosome would terminate correctly. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, another possibility: If the construct has the start codon followed by a frame shift, but in the given sequence, the reading frame is correct.

Wait, another angle: The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence should start with HA, then GADD45G. But in the given DNA, perhaps the HA tag is not included. Wait, no, the sequence starts with ATG, which would be the start for the HA tag. Or maybe the HA was added, but the start codon is after the HA, leading to no expression.

Wait, maybe the HA tag was added without a start codon. For example, the HA sequence is inserted, and the start codon is part of the HA. So let's see: the HA sequence is a short peptide, so the DNA would include ATG followed by the codons for HA, then the GADD45G.

But in the given DNA, the first codon is ATG, which is the start. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly included. But maybe the problem is that the ATG for the HA is followed by a stop codon early on, preventing the expression of the full-length protein.

Wait, looking again, the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC CGG ACA CAG TTT CC...

Wait, after the initial ATG, the 12th codon is another ATG. So the first 11 codons are after the start. Then comes another ATG, which is methionine.

So the ribosome starts at the first ATG, reads through 11 codons, then hits another ATG. That's another start codon in the middle. So the ribosome might start translating from that point, but in reality, the ribosome doesn't stop unless it hits a stop codon. So the initial ATG is the correct start, and the second ATG is just another codon (Met) in the middle. So the entire sequence is read through until the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of a second ATG in the middle is causing issues. For example, maybe the first part of the protein (before the second ATG) includes a stop codon, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I should check the entire sequence for any in-frame stop codons. Let me go through the mRNA sequence again, looking for UAA, UAG, UGA.

Looking at each codon:

1. AUG (start)
2. UAC
3. CCA
4. UAC
5. GAC
6. GGT
7. TCC
8. AGA
9. UUA
10. CGC
11. CAA
12. AUG
13. ACU
14. CTG
15. GAA
16. GAA
17. UCC
18. GCC
19. CGG
20. ACA
21. CAG
22. TTT
23. CC...
...
342. UGA (stop)

Wait, no in-frame stop codons except the last one. So the ribosome should read through and terminate correctly.

Hmm, so why isn't the protein being expressed? If the coding sequence is correct, perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: The construct may not have a poly-A tail or a promoter, which are necessary for expression. But the question says they transfected the plasmid into CHO cells. So perhaps the plasmid lacks an appropriate promoter, but the question doesn't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is with the reading frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is not in frame, causing a frameshift. But the initial part is ATG followed by the HA sequence. Let me think: the HA tag is about 11 amino acids, which is 33 nucleotides. So the first 33 nucleotides should code for HA. Let me look at the first 33 bases:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

Wait, that's 11 codons (33 bases): Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Gly, Ser, Arg, Leu, Arg, Gln.

But the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYD. Let me write the DNA sequence for that:

The HA sequence is YPYDVPDYD. Let's get the codon sequence.

YPYDVPDYD:

Each amino acid is:

Y (Tyr) = TAC
P (Pro) = CCA
Y (Tyr) = TAC
D (Asp) = GAT
V (Val) = GTT
P (Pro) = CCA
D (Asp) = GAT
Y (Tyr) = TAC
D (Asp) = GAT.

Wait, but that's 9 amino acids. Wait, the HA tag is 11 amino acids long. Maybe I'm missing a few.

Wait, the HA tag is usually 11 amino acids: YPYDVPDYD. Or perhaps more accurately, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYD, which is 9 amino acids. Or perhaps including the start and something else. Wait, I might be getting the exact sequence wrong, but the point is, the first part of the DNA sequence doesn't match the expected HA sequence.

So in the provided DNA sequence, the first 11 codons are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

Which translates to:

Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Gly Ser Arg Leu Arg Gln Met.

This doesn't look like the HA sequence. So perhaps the HA was not correctly added, leading to a frameshift or incorrect sequence, causing the HA tag to be incorrect, which might interfere with detection but not necessarily expression levels.

Wait, but the question says the issue is noticed in the sequence. So perhaps the HA sequence is messed up.

Looking at option A: the HA determinant has a missense mutation. So if the HA sequence is incorrect, the protein may not be recognized when they try to affinity-purify it. But the problem here is the lack of overexpression, not the inability to detect it.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence is not correctly cloned, causing a frameshift. For example, if the HA sequence includes an in-frame stop codon, the ribosome would terminate early.

Wait, but in the given DNA sequence, the HA part is not followed by a stop codon until the very end. So the HA is correctly cloned but perhaps the issue is that the HA sequence is followed by the GADD45G sequence without a proper linker, causing the protein to be cleaved.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: perhaps the construct has a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated and not expressed in detectable amounts.

Wait, looking again, the last codon is UGA, which is a stop. So the construct is correctly terminated. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is added in the wrong frame, causing the entire coding sequence to be in a different reading frame, leading to a stop codon earlier.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. If the HA is in the wrong frame, the entire GADD45G sequence would be in a different reading frame, leading to a stop codon somewhere. But in the provided DNA, the initial codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC..., which is in the correct frame.

Wait, unless the HA insertion caused a frameshift. Let me calculate the length of the HA coding sequence. If the HA is 11 amino acids, that's 33 bases. So the first 33 bases should be the HA sequence, then followed by the GADD45G.

Looking at the provided DNA, the first 33 bases are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

That's 11 codons, but as discussed earlier, the amino acids don't match HA. So perhaps the HA was not correctly cloned, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, maybe the HA insert was cloned in the wrong frame, causing the rest of the sequence to be in a different reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA insert wasn't added correctly, so the initial ATG is for the HA, but the rest is GADD45G in a different frame.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA and GADD45G are not properly connected, the protein might be cleaved. But without a linker, the protease might cut between the HA and the rest. However, the issue is that the protein isn't being expressed, not that it's being cleaved after expression.

Option A: the HA has a missense mutation. If the HA is mutated, the protein might not be detected by the antibody, but the expression level would still be there. So the protein would be produced but not detected, which doesn't explain the lack of overexpression.

Option B: the ribosome stops early. But the only stop codon is at the end, so the ribosome would translate the entire sequence. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Another possibility: the construct lacks an initiation codon. But the first codon is ATG, so that's the start.

Wait, perhaps the ATG is not correctly positioned. Let me check the sequence again.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. So the ribosome should start there.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the plus strand is the wrong strand for transcription. Because in the plasmid, the coding sequence should be on the sense strand, which is the same as the mRNA. If the plasmid was constructed with the coding sequence on the antisense strand, the mRNA would be complementary and not match. But the question states that the plus strand is the one they're looking at, which is the same as the mRNA.

Wait, another thought: maybe the start codon is preceded by an in-frame stop codon. But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, so that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the plasmid has a mutation in the Kozak sequence, which is important for initiation in eukaryotes. The Kozak sequence is around the start codon and helps in translation initiation. If the Kozak sequence is missing or mutated, the ribosome may not efficiently start translating, leading to low expression. But the question doesn't mention anything about the surrounding sequence, and the provided DNA starts with ATG, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is followed by a stop codon. If the HA sequence ends with a stop codon, the ribosome would terminate early. Let me look at the initial part.

The HA coding sequence would be about 11 codons. Let's look at the first 11 codons:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GGT (Gly)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. TTA (Leu)
10. CGC (Arg)
11. CAA (Gln)
12. ATG (Met)

Wait, the 11th codon is CAA, which is Gln. The 12th is ATG, Met. So the HA coding sequence would end at codon 11, which is CAA. So the HA is followed by ATG (Met) as part of GADD45G. So the HA is correctly cloned, and the next codon is ATG (Met), which is the start of GADD45G.

Wait, but that would mean the HA is followed by a Met. But in the normal GADD45G sequence, does it start with Met? Or is the start codon part of the HA?

Hmm, perhaps the HA tag is correctly cloned, but the following ATG is part of the GADD45G, which starts with ATG. So that's correct.

Wait, but let's think: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. So the start codon for HA is the first ATG, then the HA sequence, then the GADD45G with its own ATG, but that would cause a frameshift. Or perhaps the HA sequence ends before the next ATG.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence is 11 amino acids, which is 33 nucleotides. So the first 33 bases are the HA coding sequence, then the next codon is ATG for the start of GADD45G.

Looking at the given DNA, the first 33 nucleotides are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

Wait, that's 11 codons, and the 12th codon is ACT (from the next triplet). Wait, no, the 12th codon would be ACT, which is the 12th codon after the initial ATG.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recount.

Each codon is 3 bases. The first 3 bases: ATG → 1.

Next 3: TAC → 2.

Next 3: CCA →3.

And so on until the 11th codon is CAA, then the 12th is ATG.

Wait, that's 12 codons, not 11. So perhaps the HA sequence is 12 codons, which is 36 bases. But that seems longer than expected.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence is inserted correctly, but the next codon (ATG) is part of the HA, leading to a longer HA and a premature stop.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence is not correctly cloned, leading to a frameshift, causing the entire GADD45G sequence to be incorrect, leading to a stop codon somewhere. But in the provided DNA, the only stop is at the end.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the HA sequence includes a stop codon. Let me check the first 36 bases (12 codons):

1. ATG (Met)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GGT (Gly)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. TTA (Leu)
10. CGC (Arg)
11. CAA (Gln)
12. ATG (Met)

No stop codons here. So the HA is correctly cloned, and the ribosome continues into GADD45G.

Wait, but the GADD45G sequence starts with ATG. So the HA sequence is followed by another ATG. So the mRNA would have the HA sequence, then Met, then the GADD45G sequence.

But that would mean that the GADD45G is in frame with the HA, but that's correct because they're both in the same reading frame.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the HA is followed by a Met, and the GADD45G starts with Met, which could lead to a double Met, but that's not a problem. The ribosome would start at the first Met and continue.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is followed by an in-frame stop codon. But in the given sequence, the only stop is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is in the correct frame, but the GADD45G is not. Let me check the reading frame.

The DNA sequence is correct, so the reading frame should be correct. So the ribosome would read through all the codons until the end, producing a full-length protein.

So why isn't the protein expressed? The options don't seem to directly point to this, but perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But I don't see any stop codons in the HA part.

Wait, looking again at option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So the protein is expressed but quickly degraded. But the problem states that the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made. Unless proteolysis is so efficient that the protein is undetectable. But the question says they couldn't overexpress it, so maybe the issue is at the level of translation, not protein stability.

Wait, another angle: the presence of multiple in-frame Met codons (ATG) can sometimes interfere with translation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But without a stop codon, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is not correctly cloned, and the construct has a frameshift, leading to a stop codon somewhere in the middle. But the given sequence doesn't show any stop codons before the end.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence is followed by a stop codon, but the given sequence doesn't show that. For example, if the HA is correctly cloned, but the next codon is a stop, then the ribosome would stop early. But in the provided sequence, the next codon after HA is ACT (Thr), so no stop.

Hmm, I'm going around in circles. Let's think about the options again.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. That would affect detection but not necessarily expression levels.

Option B: Ribosome stops early. No, because the only stop is at the end.

Option C: No linker, causing proteolysis. That would affect protein stability, but the question is about overexpression, which implies low levels of expression, not degradation.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But UAA is a stop codon, and release factors handle that, not tRNA.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the start codon is not correctly positioned, leading to no translation. But the first codon is ATG, which is correct.

Wait, another possibility: the gene is cloned in the reverse orientation. If the coding sequence is on the wrong strand, the mRNA would be complementary, leading to no start codon. But the question says the plus strand is as given, which starts with ATG.

Wait, perhaps the promoter is not functional in the plasmid, leading to no transcription. But the question doesn't mention that, and the issue is in the sequence of the construct, not the cloning vector.

Wait, another angle: the presence of a second ATG in the middle of the coding sequence could cause a problem. Let me think: the ribosome starts at the first ATG, translates until it hits the second ATG, which is another Met. But the ribosome doesn't stop at Met; it continues. So the issue is not here.

Wait, perhaps the second ATG is causing the ribosome to restart, leading to a shorter protein. But the ribosome doesn't restart in the middle of translation. It only starts at the beginning.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of which option would prevent overexpression.

If option B is correct, the ribosome stops early. But the mRNA doesn't have any stops until the end. So B is incorrect.

Option C: lack of linker. If the HA is not followed by a linker, perhaps the protein is not properly folded, but that wouldn't prevent its expression. It might affect function but not expression levels.

Option A: a mutation in HA would affect detection, not expression.

So perhaps the issue is that the HA sequence is not correctly cloned, leading to a frameshift. For example, if the HA insert was cloned in a way that the reading frame shifts, leading to a stop codon early in the GADD45G sequence.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the HA is followed by GADD45G in the same frame. Let me check the initial part:

HA sequence (first 11 codons):

1. ATG (Met)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GGT (Gly)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. TTA (Leu)
10. CGC (Arg)
11. CAA (Gln)
12. ATG (Met) → GADD45G starts here.

Wait, but GADD45G's own start codon is the 12th codon, which is ATG. So that's fine. But perhaps the HA sequence is supposed to be followed by GADD45G without an additional Met. So the initial HA sequence ends with CAA, then the next codon is ATG (Met) for GADD45G. So the full sequence is HA followed by Met-GADD45G.

But that's correct because GADD45G starts with Met. So the HA is properly cloned.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA and GADD45G sequences are not in the same reading frame, but that's not the case here.

Another thought: perhaps the HA sequence includes a stop codon. Let me check the first 33 bases again.

The first 11 codons (33 bases) are:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG.

Wait, that's 11 codons. The 11th is CAA (Gln), and the 12th is ATG (Met).

So no stop in the HA part.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA sequence is longer than it should be, leading to an additional Met and causing a frameshift. But I don't see that.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence is not followed by a proper Kozak sequence, which is important for initiation in eukaryotic cells. The Kozak sequence is typically around the start codon, like 'gccRCCaugG', where R is a purine (A or G). If the Kozak sequence is missing, translation efficiency drops. But the question doesn't provide information about surrounding sequences, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the HA sequence is in a different reading frame, causing a stop codon in the GADD45G part. But in the given DNA, everything is in the same frame.

At this point, I'm not making progress. Let me look for other possibilities.

Wait, the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence should be HA followed by GADD45G. But perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong orientation, leading to no expression. But the question states that the HA is at the N-terminus, so the sequence should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon. Let me check again.

The first 11 codons:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GGT (Gly)
7. TCC (Ser)
8. AGA (Arg)
9. TTA (Leu)
10. CGC (Arg)
11. CAA (Gln)
12. ATG (Met)

No stop codons. So the HA is correctly cloned.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA sequence includes a stop codon in a different frame. But that's not relevant because the reading frame is correct.

Hmm. Another angle: the initial ATG is followed by a codon that is not in the correct frame. Wait, no, because the entire sequence is in the same frame.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA sequence is not followed by a proper start codon for GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the GADD45G starts with ATG, which is correct.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So the protein is being expressed but rapidly degraded. But the question says the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the construct is being made but the protein is broken down quickly, making it undetectable. But the experiment would require overexpression, so if the protein is being made but degraded, you wouldn't see it. But the question states they couldn't overexpress it, which might imply it's not being made.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized as foreign and degraded via the proteasome. But that's a possibility, but it's not one of the options given.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA sequence is followed by a stop codon, but in the provided sequence, the stop is at the end. So no.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the HA sequence includes a stop codon, but I don't see any.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is correctly cloned, but the next codon (ATG) is not part of the GADD45G. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the start codon for GADD45G is missing. But in the given sequence, it's present.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

The key clue is that the plasmid's plus strand ends with ...GAGTGA3'. So the last codon in mRNA is UGA, which is a stop. That's correct. So the issue isn't with the stop codon.

Looking at the options, option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA and GADD45G are directly connected without a linker, perhaps the protein is prone to degradation. But the issue would be detection, not expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag may have a premature stop codon in a different reading frame, but that's not relevant because the frame is correct.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence is not followed by a Kozak sequence, making the GADD45G's ATG not recognized as a start codon. But Kozak sequences are more important for initiation; without them, the ribosome may not efficiently translate the GADD45G part.

But the given DNA doesn't show any sequence around the ATG for GADD45G, so perhaps that's the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct lacks an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), but that's more relevant for viral proteins.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, but in the given sequence, the stop is at the end. So that's not the case.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the HA sequence is correctly cloned, but the GADD45G sequence is not. For example, the GADD45G sequence might have a frameshift or an early stop codon.

But in the given DNA, the GADD45G sequence is correct, ending with UGA.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the HA tag and GADD45G are in the same reading frame, but the HA is causing the ribosome to terminate early. But I don't see any stops before the end.

Another possibility: the HA tag includes a stop codon in the same frame. Let me check the HA part again.

In the first 11 codons, none are stop codons. So the HA is correctly cloned.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is followed by a stop codon due to a frameshift. But the given sequence doesn't show that.

At this point, I think the most plausible option is option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. Because without a linker, the protein may be recognized as a target for degradation. But the question is about overexpression, not detection. So the protein might be expressed but quickly degraded, leading to low levels. However, the question states that the protein isn't overexpressed, implying it's not being made in sufficient quantities.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: perhaps the HA tag introduces a premature stop codon in the same reading frame, but in the given sequence, there's no such stop.

Wait, the initial part of the DNA has another ATG at position 12. So the ribosome reads the first 11 codons, then hits another ATG, which is part of the GADD45G. So the entire sequence is in the same frame. So the ribosome reads through until the end, making a full-length protein.

So why isn't the protein expressed? I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA sequence is followed by a stop codon, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence is correctly cloned, but the GADD45G's start codon is missing. So the GADD45G isn't being translated. But in the given DNA, the GADD45G starts with ATG, so that's not the case.

I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the given sequence, the only stop codon is at the end. So the construct should produce a full-length protein. Since the protein isn't overexpressed, the issue must be elsewhere.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminates early. But the only stop is at the end. So B is incorrect.

Option C: linker issue. If the protein is unstable, the level would be low, making it appear as if it's not overexpressed.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein is not expressing the protein as expected. The construct includes a HA tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence, and the provided DNA sequence of the plus strand was analyzed for potential issues. The key observations and analysis are as follows:

1. **DNA Sequence Analysis**:  
   - The sequence starts with `ATG`, the start codon, and ends with `TGA`, which translates to `UGA` in mRNA, a stop codon. This indicates that the construct is properly terminated.  
   - No other stop codons (`UAA`, `UAG`, `UGA`) were found in the sequence except at the end, meaning the ribosome should translate the entire sequence without terminating early.  

2. **HA Tag Sequence**:  
   - The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. The first 11 codons of the sequence were analyzed, and the corresponding amino acids do not match the expected HA sequence. This suggests a potential issue with the HA tag, such as a missense mutation or incorrect cloning.  

3. **Second Start Codon**:  
   - The sequence contains a second `ATG` (Met) codon at position 12, which is unusual but not necessarily problematic. The ribosome does not terminate at this codon; it continues translating until the stop codon at the end.  

4. **Proteolysis and Linker Sequence**:  
   - Option C suggests that the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis of the nascent chain. Without a linker, the protein may be prone to degradation, leading to low detectable levels. However, the question specifies that the protein is not being overexpressed, which implies the issue lies in its synthesis rather than degradation.  

5. **Missense Mutation in HA Tag**:  
   - Option A posits that the HA tag has a missense mutation. While this could affect detection or function, it would not necessarily prevent the protein from being expressed, as translation should still occur.  

6. **Ribosome Termination Early**:  
   - Option B claims the ribosome terminates early. However, the sequence lacks any stop codons before the end, making this option unlikely.  

7. **tRNA for UAA Codon**:  
   - Option D suggests the absence of tRNA for the `UAA` codon. This is incorrect because `UAA` is a stop codon recognized by release factors, not tRNA.  

**Conclusion**:  
The most plausible explanation is that the lack of a linker sequence (Option C) is causing the protein to be degraded after synthesis, leading to low detectable levels and the appearance of no overexpression. While the HA tag sequence and other factors were analyzed, they do not fully explain the lack of overexpression as effectively as the proteolysis hypothesis.  

Answer: C
