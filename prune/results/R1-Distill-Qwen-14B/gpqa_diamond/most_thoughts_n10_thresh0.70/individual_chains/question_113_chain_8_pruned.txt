Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound. Let's see what information I have.

The question says that the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The results from each of these techniques are given, and I have to match them to one of the options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

First, I'll go through each spectroscopic data point one by one and see what they tell me.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of either O-H or N-H groups. The peak is very broad, which is typical for O-H in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids, but wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, the 1700 is a strong peak, which often indicates a carbonyl group. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching) but I'm not sure. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than an aldehyde or ketone. Oh, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, it could be a C=O in a carbonyl compound, perhaps like an ester or amide, but considering the O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? But wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but their carbonyl is around 1700. But in the IR, the 1700 could also be an ester or ketone.

Wait, but looking at the other IR peak: 1650. That might be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester (where the carbonyl is around 1730-1750, but maybe in this case, it's a lower wavenumber because of conjugation or something else). Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=O stretch in an aromatic ring
