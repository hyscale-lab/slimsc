Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass oscillates around an equilibrium point, like a mass on a spring. Oh wait, the question says it's 1-dimensional and relativistic. Oh right, that means we have to consider relativistic effects, so Newtonian mechanics might not be enough.

The problem states that the maximum amplitude is A, and the force obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. Wait, but in relativity, the equations of motion change because of the speed of light limit. Oh right, in Newtonian physics, the speed can be anything, but in relativity, it's capped at c. So the maximum speed must be less than or equal to c.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, including some involving c and square roots. I think I need to derive v_max from the relativistic equations of motion.

Wait, how does a relativistic harmonic oscillator work? In the Newtonian case, the speed is the maximum when the mass passes through the equilibrium point. But relativistically, the equations get more complicated. Maybe I should start from the relativistic equation for the oscillator.

I remember that the relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator is given by the Klein-Gordon equation when considering a single particle, but that's a bit advanced. Alternatively, maybe it's a modified form of the Newton's law considering relativistic momentum.

Wait, let's think about energy. In the Newtonian case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA
