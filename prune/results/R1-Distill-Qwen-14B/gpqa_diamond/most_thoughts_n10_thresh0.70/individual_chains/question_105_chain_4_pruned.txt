Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, which have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The setup is such that when this star is observed, the brightness variations due to rotation look like those caused by an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star, assuming no spots.

Hmm. So I need to compare the brightness change caused by the spots to the change that would be caused by a planet passing in front of the star (transit method). The key is that the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same in both cases. So I'll need to model both scenarios and set their amplitudes equal to each other.

First, let's think about the spotted star. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us (as the star rotates), the observed brightness decreases because the spots are emitting less light. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view. So during the rotation, the spots move into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically.

Wait, but how exactly does the brightness variation work? The brightness variation is due to the changing area of the spotted region that is visible as the star rotates. So when the star is viewed face-on, the spots are on the limb, so less of the spotted area is visible. But when it's edge-on, more of the spots are visible. Hmm, no, wait. Actually, when the star is viewed face-on, the entire hemisphere is visible, but when it's edge-on, it's a different situation. Wait, no, waitâ€”no, the star's rotation period would cause the spots to come into and out of view as it rotates. But I'm a bit confused about how the filling factor and the rotation affect the observed brightness.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the maximum dip in brightness caused by the spots and then compare it to the dip caused by a planet transit.

So, the star's total
