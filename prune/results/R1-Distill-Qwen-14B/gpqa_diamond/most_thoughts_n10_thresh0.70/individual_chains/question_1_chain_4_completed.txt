Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Hmm, that's 6.59e-7 eV. Approximately 7e-7 eV. 

Now for the second state, Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34)/(1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 7e-7 eV and 7e-8 eV respectively. 

Wait, but for the energy difference ΔE to be clearly resolved, it should be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is just the sum, the states might just barely be distinguishable. But sometimes, the condition is that the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty. So, I'm thinking the energy difference between E1 and E2, which is |E2 - E1|, should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but the problem states that we want to "clearly distinguish" the two energy levels. So perhaps the difference should be much larger than the individual uncertainties. But the options given are A: 1e-9 eV, B:1e-11 eV, C:1e-4, D:1e-8.

Now, let me calculate the sum of the uncertainties. ΔE1 is about 7e-7 eV and ΔE2 is 7e-8 eV. So adding them gives approximately 7.7e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than this sum. Looking at the options:

Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than the sum. So that's too small.

Option B is 1e-11, way too small.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 7.7e-7. That would work.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 1e-8. But 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is less than 7.7e-7. So that's not enough.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly distinguished, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) for a state with lifetime \( \Delta t \) is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
|E_2 - E_1| > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Adding the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is too small.

### Final Answer
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two energy levels.
