Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It's about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The formula is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. But wait, when there are multiple charges, the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh right, because each pair contributes to the total energy.

So in this case, we have 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those twelve charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge at P. But wait, the problem says 12 are at 2m from P, so the 13th is at P, so each of the 12 is 2m from the 13th. So the 13th is fixed, so I think only the 12 charges are moving relative to it, but wait no— the 12 are constrained, so their positions don't change. So the 13th is fixed, and the 12 are each at 2m from P. So the distance between the 13th and each of the twelve is 2m. 

But I'm trying to calculate the potential energy of the entire system. So I need to consider all the pairs. The 13th charge is fixed, so the potential energy contributions come from each of the twelve charges and the 13th. But wait, wait— each of the twelve also has a potential energy due to their interactions with each other. Because they are all identical and placed at the same distance from P, but what about the distance between the twelve charges themselves?

Wait, the problem states that the twelve charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P. So I think that implies that each of the twelve is a distance of 2m from P, but their distances from each other could vary. But wait, that's not given. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the twelve are arranged in some way that all are 2m from P, but their mutual distances are different. But if they are arranged, say, on a sphere around P, but then they can move on the sphere. But since the problem is about the minimum energy, perhaps the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when the charges are as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion energy? Or wait, no, because all the charges are positive, so they repel each other. Wait, each charge is 2e, so positive. So the potential energy between
