Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So ε is an energy constant, and n is just an arbitrary direction.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix with specific entries. So when they're dotted with n, it's like taking the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix. Oh right! So σ · n is σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, where n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1 because n is a unit vector.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix σ_i are ±1. But wait, when you have a sum of these matrices multiplied by coefficients, what's the eigenvalue then? Oh, right, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1 because each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, and when you take a linear combination, the maximum eigenvalue is sqrt(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) multiplied by 1? Wait, no. Because each term in the sum is a matrix, and the maximum eigenvalue of the sum is the magnitude of the vector n. But n is a unit vector, so the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The operator σ · n is a matrix, and its trace is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. The determinant of this matrix would be the product of the eigenvalues. Since the trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero, and the product is -1 (because the determinant of σ · n is (1)(-1) = -1). So eigenvalues have to be +1 and -1.

So the eigen
