Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a multi-step synthesis starting from a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it goes through several reactions to form product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, so I need to figure out the structure of product 4 and then count its distinct hydrogens. Let me break down each step.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, right? So it's a bicyclic compound with two rings. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. The structure probably means that the oxygen is attached to the bicyclo system at the 7 position, and the tert-butyl group is attached to the oxygen.

Next step: this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, the reagents here include sodium iodide. So maybe this is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. But let me think about the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group. So each methyl group is attached to two bromines. So the structure is like cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br2 groups at carbons 5 and 6.

I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like CH2Br2) are treated with a base like NaI, they can undergo elimination reactions. Maybe an E2 mechanism? Alternatively, perhaps this is a coupling reaction.

Wait, but the starting material has an ether group, tert-butoxy. Maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But the other compound has two dibromomethyl groups. Since there are two equivalents, perhaps each of those groups is reacting.

Wait, the starting bicyclo compound has an oxygen, perhaps with lone pairs. Maybe it's acting as a nucleophile. But tert-butoxy is a poor leaving group, but in this case, perhaps it's acting as a base. Or maybe the reaction involves elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. Maybe the bicyclo compound's oxygen is nucleophilic, attacking the dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, but the reagent is NaI. In such conditions, maybe the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution. Each Br is leaving, and the oxygen from the bicyclo compound is attacking, forming new ether linkages.

Wait, since there are two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound, perhaps the bicyclo compound is adding two of these groups. So each Br on
