Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that in stars, the photosphere emits most of the star's light, and under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the conditions there can be described using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, so the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution equation is probably key here. The distribution tells us the population of particles in different energy states. The formula I remember is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), and k is Boltzmann's constant. 

In this problem, I think the statistical weights might be the same for both stars because we're comparing the same energy levels in the same element (iron). So g_i and g_j are the same for each star, which means the ratio n_i/n_j would be exp( - delta E/(k*T) ), with delta E being the energy difference. 

Wait, but in the question, it says the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So if n_1 is the number for star_1 and n_2 for star_2, then n_1 = 2 * n_2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think it's that in star_1, the population in the excited state is higher. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is what's being compared. 

So for each star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms (n_i) to ground (n_j) would be given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me denote the ratio as R. For star_1, R1 = n1_i / n1_j = exp( - E/(k T1) ). Similarly, R2 = n2_i / n2_j = exp( - E/(k T2) ). 

But the problem says that R1 is twice R2, right? Because in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the way it's phrased is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe R1 is twice R2. Or wait, perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, perhaps the ratio is n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says that the excitation is twice as much. So for each star, the fraction of atoms in the excited state relative to the ground state is given by the
