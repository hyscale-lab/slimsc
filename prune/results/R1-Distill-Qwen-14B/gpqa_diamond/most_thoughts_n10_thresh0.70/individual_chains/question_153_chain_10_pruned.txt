Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It usually forms a new carbon-carbon bond, right? Let me think through each part of the question step by step.

The question has three separate reactions (A, B, C) and four options to choose from. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, dimethyl malonate is actually the diester of malonic acid. So in the presence of a base like NaOEt, it can form an enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor here. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, with the substituent being the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, actually, let's clarify. The compound is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon? Wait, no, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-; the numbering starts from the carbonyl. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH₂ group? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. The structure is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but if it's 3-(p-tolyl), that would be substituting the CH₂ group. So the structure would be CH₂(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, that
