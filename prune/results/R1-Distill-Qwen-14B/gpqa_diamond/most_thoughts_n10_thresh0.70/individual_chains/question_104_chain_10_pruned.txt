Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. Right, when a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to wobble, and that makes the spectral lines shift periodically.

The question says both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So the planets are probably in the same mass category, but the Doppler shifts are different.

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 has 7. Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. Because the bigger the shift, the higher the velocity. So a larger shift would mean the star is moving faster due to the planet's pull.

But wait, how does the velocity relate to the orbital period? Oh, right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some formula. The formula for K is (V) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds) ) )^(1/3) ). Hmm, but maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I remember that K depends on the planet mass, the star mass, and the orbital period.

Wait, no, I think K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for K is something like K = [( ( G * P ) / ( 2 * pi ) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) ] / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) ). But since the planets are in circular orbits, e is zero, so the denominator is just 1. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, the denominator M_star + M_p is approximately M_star.

So, K ≈ ( ( G * P )^(1/3) * M_p ) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi))^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio between the two planets. Because both stars have same mass, and the two planets have same mass (since both are Neptune-like), so M_p
