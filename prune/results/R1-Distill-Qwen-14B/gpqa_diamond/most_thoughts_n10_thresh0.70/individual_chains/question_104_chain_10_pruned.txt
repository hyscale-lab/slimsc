Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. The planets are in circular orbits.

The key data points are the shifts in their spectral lines. Planet #1's shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

Alright, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's movement due to the planet's gravity. The formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude (K) to other parameters is probably needed here. Let me think... The formula is K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period. Oh right, there's a formula that connects the semi-amplitude K, the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star. 

Alternatively, I think the relationship between K and the period P can be derived from the formula for the velocity of the star in its orbit. The star's velocity (K) is given by K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express it as K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ), assuming that M_p is much smaller than M_star, which is the case here since Neptune's mass is much smaller than the Sun's.

Wait, let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M
