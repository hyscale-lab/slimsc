Okay, so I have this question about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means that a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry that leads to enantiomers.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   - Structure: Chlorine on C1, methyl on C2, double bond between C1 and C2. The configuration is Z, which means the higher priority groups are on the same side.
   - Wait, but can this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, butene is C4H8, so 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, the formula is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is Cl on C1, C2 has a methyl and double bond to C3.
   - Wait, but double bonds can't be chiral centers because they're trigonal planar. But can the molecule have a plane of symmetry or any other factors? Let's think about the structure: Cl on C1, which is connected to a CH2 group. Wait, no. Let me draw it out. Structure: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait that's butane. Wait, butene has a double bond. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CH
