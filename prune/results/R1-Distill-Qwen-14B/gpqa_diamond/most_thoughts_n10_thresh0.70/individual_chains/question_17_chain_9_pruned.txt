Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says. It says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is correct.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Right, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in this case, the stoichiometry is 1:1.

So the formation constant K is given. Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). And the problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I think I can assume that the complex doesn't dissociate much because Kf is a large number, meaning the complex is stable. But wait, the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions, so I need to find [Ca²+].

If the solution is at stoichiometric point, maybe all the Ca²+ is complexed. Wait, but in reality,
