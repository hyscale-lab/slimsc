Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what compound A is and what catalyst was used. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. I remember that pyrrolidines are five-membered rings with one nitrogen. 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon. The product is a substituted pyrrolidine where a cyclohexylidene group is attached to the first carbon. So, the structure would have a ring where the cyclohexylidene (which is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, like a cyclohexene substituent) is connected via a methylene group (CH2) to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, actually, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)pyrrolidine would have a cyclohexylidene group (a cyclohexene ring) attached to the pyrrolidine via a CH2 group. So the substituent is a methylene group (CH2-) connected to a cyclohexene ring.

So, the reaction is between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A, with an acid catalyst. I'm trying to think what reaction forms such a product.

I think this is a type of alkylation or maybe some kind of addition. Alternatively, it could be a ring-opening or a ring-forming reaction. Wait, acid-catalyzed reactions of amines... Oh, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3, and an alkyl halide. But the options don't list AlCl3; they list TsOH and acetic acid.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe it's some kind of enamine formation. Enamines are often formed by reacting amines with ketones or aldehydes. The process typically involves two steps: first, the amine reacts with a ketone or aldehyde to form an imine, then the imine is protonated and the water is lost to form the enamine.

Wait, but in this case, the product is an enamine, perhaps. Let me think. The starting amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine. If it reacts with an aldehyde, like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, maybe?

In the formation of an enamine, the amine would first react with a carbonyl group. For example, an aldehyde would form an imine, and then under acidic conditions, perhaps with heat, the imine would lose water to form a double bond, creating the enamine.

So, the product would have a double bond (the enamine) attached to the pyrrolidine. Looking at the product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine implies that the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexene ring. So, the cyclohexene is connected via a methylene bridge to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, another approach: the product is an annulation product? Or perhaps a ring expansion. Alternatively, the reaction could involve the formation of a new ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a condensation reaction. I'm recalling the Claisen or Aldol condensation, but that's more about aldehydes and ketones forming enones. Alternatively, maybe it's a Robinson annulation? But Robinson typically involves a conjugated enone and a ketone for forming a six-membered ring, which doesn't seem to fit here.

Wait, another thought: the product seems to have a cyclohexene ring fused or connected to the pyrrolidine. So maybe the starting material was an aldehyde that, upon reaction with the amine, formed a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Stork enamine alkylation. In Stork enamine chemistry, the enamine is formed, and then it can undergo alkylation. But in this scenario, the compound A would be an aldehyde or ketone. So if 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with an aldehyde, perhaps under acid catalysis, could form the enamine.

Wait, but the product's structure: the cyclohexylidene group is on a methylene attached to the pyrrolidine. So the substituent is CH2-cyclohexene. That suggests that the starting aldehyde was cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is O=C-(CH2)5CH2 (but wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be PhCH2CHO, but actually, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is cyclohexyl with a formyl group, so structure is (cyclohexyl)CHO.

So when this aldehyde reacts with the amine, under acid catalysis, it would form an imine. But in amines, especially cyclic ones like pyrrolidine, the formation of enamines is a possibility. Let me sketch the structures.

3-methylpyrrolidine has a five-membered ring, with the nitrogen and four carbons, one of which is methyl at position 3. When it reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, they would form an imine, but under acidic conditions, the imine would lose a proton and a water molecule to form an enamine.

Wait, the structure of the enamine would be a double bond between the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen and the cyclohexyl group. So the product would be 1-(cyclohexylidene)ethyl-pyrrolidine. Wait, but the given product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is a CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring.

So, the mechanism would be:

Aldehyde (RCHO) reacts with amine (RNH2) to form an imine (RCH=N-R'), then under acid and heat, the imine loses H2O to form the enamine (RCH=CR'— but wait, I'm not getting the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the aldehyde group being added to the amine, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond, and then cyclization occurs.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a new ring. Let me think: 3-methylpyrrolidine has a certain structure, and when it reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, maybe the aldehyde group adds to the amine, leading to a new ring formation.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is undergoing a conjugate addition or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reagents.

The options for compound A are either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. And the catalysts are TsOH or acetic acid.

TsOH is para-toluenesulfonic acid, a strong acid and a good catalyst for various acid-catalyzed reactions, like esterifications, alkylation, etc. Acetic acid is a weaker acid but can also act as a catalyst in some reactions.

If the reaction involves the formation of an imine or enamine, then an aldehyde would be needed. So if the starting material is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO attached to a cyclohexane ring), then the reaction with an amine would form an enamine.

In the case of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and 3-methylpyrrolidine, the aldehyde would first react with the amine to form an iminium ion, which then would lose a water molecule to form the enamine.

So in this case, the product would have a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen. So the substituent would be a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexene ring.

So the product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, would have a cyclohexene ring connected via a CH2 group to the pyrrolidine ring at the 1-position.

Which option uses cyclohexanecarbaldehyde as A? Looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH

Option B: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = acetic acid

So those are possibilities.

But wait, what about the other options: options C and D have A as vinylcyclohexane. Vinylcyclohexane would be a cyclohexane ring with a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but actually, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So vinylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, but more accurately, the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that's a vinyl group, like CH2-CH2 attached but with a double bond. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so vinylcyclohexane would be (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2? Or is it cyclohexane with a double bond?

No, vinylcyclohexane would be a cyclohexane ring with a vinyl group, meaning a CH2-CH2 group where one of the CH2 is part of the ring. Wait, no. I think vinylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a vinyl group, i.e., -(CH2)CH2 but that's not correct because vinyl is CH2=CH-. So it's a cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2 group, but one of the CH2's is actually a CH2 that's part of a double bond. Wait, I'm getting confused. Actually, vinylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with a vinyl substituent, so structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Wait, no. Vinyl group is -CH2-CH2-, but with a double bond. So it's -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between the two carbons. So vinylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2 group, but the CH2 groups are connected by a double bond, so it's a cyclohexane ring where a CH2 group is attached, and that CH2 is connected to another CH2 via a double bond. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2, but the CH2-CH2 is actually a double bond, so it's cyclohexane-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the CH2s. So it's cyclohexane with a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- substituent.

So if A is vinylcyclohexane, then the reaction would be between 3-methylpyrrolidine and vinylcyclohexane, under acid catalysis.

What kind of reaction would that be? Perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction? But Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. Or maybe an addition reaction.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine. Reacting it with a dienophile like vinylcyclohexane... Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alkylation of the amine, but vinylcyclohexane isn't an alkylating agent unless it's undergoing some kind of addition.

Wait, if A is an aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), then the reaction forms an enamine, which would explain the structure. So for that, the catalyst would be an acid. TsOH is a strong acid, so it can protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, allowing the amine to attack.

Alternatively, acetic acid could also catalyze the formation, but maybe TsOH is more efficient for such reactions.

So looking at the options, if A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then either B is TsOH or acetic acid. Options A and B.

But which catalyst is used in enamine formation? From what I remember, enamine formation typically uses an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or another strong acid. TsOH is a strong acid, so it's a possible catalyst.

Looking at the options, the first option (A: A=cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B=TsOH) and option B (same A, B=acetic acid).

So which one is more suitable?

I think that for enamine formation, a strong acid is needed. Acetic acid is a weaker acid compared to TsOH. So TsOH would be a better catalyst for this reaction.

So, the correct reagent would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (A) with TsOH (B). That's option A.

Wait, but why not acetic acid? Let me think. Enamine formation steps: the amine first reacts with the carbonyl to form an imine, which under acidic conditions loses water to form the enamine. So a strong acid would better facilitate the dehydration step. TsOH is a strong acid (pKa around -2), while acetic acid is weaker (pKa ~5). So, in an acid-catalyzed reaction requiring significant protonation (like dehydration), TsOH would be better.

So option A (A=cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B=TsOH) is correct.

Wait, but the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me think: in the enamine, the structure would have a double bond between the nitrogen's adjacent carbon and the cyclohexyl group. So, the substituent would be a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexene ring.

So the reaction seems correct.

So the correct answer would be option A.


The reaction involves the acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The product structure indicates that a cyclohexene ring is connected to the pyrrolidine via a methylene group, suggesting the formation of an enamine. Enamine formation typically proceeds through two steps: (1) reaction of the amine with a carbonyl compound (e.g., an aldehyde) to form an imine, and (2) dehydration of the imine under acidic conditions to yield the enamine.

Given the options, compound A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, as it provides the aldehyde group necessary for enamine formation. Vinylcyclohexane, on the other hand, does not have a carbonyl group and is not suitable for this reaction. Therefore, options C and D can be eliminated.

The catalyst must facilitate the dehydration step in enamine formation. TsOH (para-toluenesulfonic acid) is a strong acid (pKa ≈ -2) and is well-suited for this reaction, as it effectively promotes the removal of water from the imine intermediate. In contrast, acetic acid (pKa ≈ 5) is a weaker acid and less effective for this purpose. Thus, TsOH is the better choice for the catalyst.

Combining these considerations, the correct reagent and catalyst are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (A) and TsOH (B), making option A the correct answer.

Answer: A
