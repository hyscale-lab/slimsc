Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a multiple-choice question, and I want to make sure I get it right. Let me read through the problem again carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also a reagent, so I'm thinking maybe it's something common like a strong base or acid.

Let me try to figure out each part. Starting with gas W. The molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule must have an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. CO2 doesn't work because it's a molecule with two atoms. Wait, no, CO2 is O=C=O, so it's three atoms but not a diatomic. Oh, but wait, sometimes gases like O2 or N2 are diatomic. For a diatomic molecule, each atom contributes to the total. Let's see, if the molecule has same protons and neutrons in each atom? Or same in the entire molecule?

Wait, the problem says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So (number of neutrons in all atoms) = (number of protons in all atoms). So for example, if it's H2O, the total protons would be 2 (H) + 8 (O) =10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8. So total neutrons is 8. That's not equal. Hmm.

Looking for a molecule where total protons equal total neutrons. Let's think about H2, but that's two H atoms. Each has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. He? No, that's monoatomic. Maybe NH3? No, that's a gas, but not diatomic. Wait, perhaps it's a molecule like CH4? No, that's not a common gas at room temp. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecule could be something like NO, but let me think. NO has 7 protons (N) and 8 (O), so total protons 15. Neutrons: N has 7-15? Wait, N has 7 protons, and in the most common isotope, it's ^14N with 7 neutrons. O is ^16O with 8 neutrons. So NO would have (7 +8) protons =15, and (7+8)=15 neutrons. Oh! So that's 15 each. So NO is a possibility. But wait, when does that happen? Because in reality, NO is a diatomic molecule with each atom contributing protons and neutrons. So the molecule's total protons and total neutrons are equal. Another example: Cl2. Each Cl has 17 protons. The common isotope is ^35Cl, which has 18 neutrons. So Cl2 would have 34 protons (17*2) and 36 (18*2) neutrons. That's not equal. So no.

Wait, what about O2? O has 8 protons. If it's ^16O, which is most common, each O has 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, that works. So gas W could be O2. Because in O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons would be 16 (8*2), and total neutrons 16 (8*2). So that fits.

Alternatively, another possibility is N2. Each N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (assuming ^14N). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that also fits.

So gas W is either O2 or N2. But let's think about the reaction. Substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W. Let me think about possible reactions.

If X is a metal, perhaps reacting with an acid (Y could be an acid like H2SO4), producing hydrogen gas. But H2 is H-H, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So total protons (2), total neutrons (0). Not equal. So H2 doesn't fit. So that's not it.

Alternatively, if Y is water, and perhaps X is something reactive. Wait, another thought: if X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, and reacts with an acid like H2SO4 (liquid Y). The reaction would produce CO2 gas. Let's see: CO2 has C (6 protons), O (8 each). So the molecule has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if ^12C), O has 8 each (^16O). So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So protons and neutrons are equal. So CO2 is another possibility for gas W.

Wait, that's a better fit. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that's another candidate. So perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid, releasing CO2.

Wait, but let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. So maybe X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, which produces CO2, and the precipitate is a metal hydroxide or something else.

Wait, but another angle: The product B is released when G is heated. B has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so just above freezing. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water ice, but that's 273 K. Wait, 277 is about 4 C, so perhaps another substance. Or maybe it's a different compound. Wait, another thought: sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) decomposes upon heating. Let me think about that.

Wait, if G is a carbonate, maybe when heated, it decomposes. For example, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) upon heating doesn't decompose much, but sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is magnesium carbonate, which upon heating might give magnesium oxide and CO2. Or perhaps it's something else.

But wait, the problem says when G is heated, it releases B. So B is a gas? Or a solid? Because the melting point of B is 277 K. If B is a solid with a melting point at 277 K, which is about 4°C, then perhaps B is something that's solid at room temp but melts just above 0. Alternatively, maybe B is a different kind of compound.

But let me think of B being perhaps CO2 or another gas. Wait, CO2's melting point is way lower, around 217 K, so that can't be. Alternatively, maybe B is another solid.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is something that, when heated, releases B, which is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. Let me think of substances with melting points around that. For example, water ice melts at 273 K, which is close. But B is a product of heating G, so maybe something decomposes to produce H2O. Wait, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the precipitate G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. So for example:

If X is a carbonate, say MgCO3. It reacts with acid (Y, like H2SO4) to produce CO2, MgSO4, and water. Wait, but MgSO4 is soluble, so perhaps a different product.

Wait, no, when a carbonate reacts with an acid, you get a salt, water, and CO2. So, if X is Na2CO3, and Y is H2SO4, then the reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

The precipitate G would form if the product is insoluble. Wait, but in this case, Na2SO4 is soluble, so perhaps Y is a different acid or X is a different salt.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water, and X reacts to form a precipitate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of a keto acid with substance X gives a product with two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which has a ketone group. Wait, no, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. A keto acid would have a ketone group elsewhere, like in the case of something like pyruvic acid (CH3COCH2COOH). When such a compound reacts with X, perhaps a base, it deprotonates to form a salt. Or maybe X is a strong oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, if X is a metal, like sodium, reacting with a keto acid would form a salt and release hydrogen gas. But earlier thoughts suggest that gas might not fit W's description.

Wait, going back to the gas W. Let's recap possible options. If W is CO2, then the reaction between X (maybe a carbonate) and Y (acid) produces CO2. Then the precipitate G would be perhaps a sulfate or another salt. But if X is a carbonate, the precipitate might not form if the product is soluble.

Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfite, and Y is an acid, producing SO2 gas. But SO2 has 16 protons (S:16, O:8 each; 16 + 2*8=32 protons? Wait, no, each O is 8, but SO2 has 2 O's, so total protons would be 16 (S) + 2*8 (O) = 32. Neutrons: S is ^32S has 16 neutrons, O is ^16O (8 each). So total neutrons: 16 (S) + 2*8=32. So yes, 32 each. That would fit W.

Wait, but then the reaction would be a sulfite reacting with an acid to produce SO2 gas. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is NO, which has 15 protons and 15 neutrons. But earlier I thought NO is possible. Let me think about it. Then, the reaction would involve a nitrite or something reacting with an acid.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitride, reacting with an acid to produce NH3 or NO. Hmm, but NH3 has 14 protons (N:14? Wait, no, NH3 is N with 7, and three H's. So total protons: 7+3=10. Neutrons: N is ^14N (7 neutrons), H has none. So 7. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps NO is the gas. Let me think. If W is NO, then the reaction between X and Y produces NO.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this from another angle.

The question mentions that substance X is used as a reagent, especially its analog, in organic chemistry. Common reagents in organic chemistry include things like NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, Na2CO3, etc. But X is incorporating a heavier isotope. So, for example, maybe X is sodium (Na) but with a heavier isotope, like ^25Mg? Wait, no, sodium's main isotope is ^23Na.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a halogen, like Cl or Br, but that's not a common reagent in the context of reactions with acids.

Wait, another idea: X is a metal that reacts with an acid to produce hydrogen gas. But earlier I thought H2 doesn't fit the W description. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the melting point of B. 277 K is about 4°C. What has a melting point around that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, that's higher. Wait, another thought: perhaps B is sodium chloride, but NaCl has a much higher melting point.

Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, Na2CO3·10H2O has a melting point around 277 K? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like sodium bicarbonate, which decomposes when heated. Wait, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes upon heating to produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. The melting point of NaHCO3 is about 270 K, which is close to 277 K. So maybe B is NaHCO3.

Wait, but the problem says when G is heated, B is released. So if G is a carbonate, perhaps when heated, it decomposes into something else, and B is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide, which upon heating releases water or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between X (a metal carbonate) and an acid Y, producing CO2 gas, and the precipitate is a metal sulfate or another salt. Or, if the acid is in excess, perhaps the precipitate is a hydroxide.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other part: the product of the reaction with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, forming a salt with two oxygen atoms? Or perhaps X is something else.

Wait, if X is a halogen, like Cl2, reacting with a keto acid might involve substitution, but I'm not sure how that leads to a product with two oxygen atoms.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X must consist of at least two elements. But X is a substance, perhaps a compound.

Wait, if X is a metal, maybe like sodium. Sodium has isotopes; the heavier one is ^25Mg? Wait, no, sodium's main isotopes are ^23Na. Wait, but heavier isotopes could be ^25Na, but they're rare.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like ammonium, but that's not a metal.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a transition metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try to identify the elements in X. Let's think about the possible gases again. If W is CO2, then X and Y's reaction produces CO2. So perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Then, the precipitate G could be a metal hydroxide if the acid is in excess. Or if the acid is limited, perhaps a salt is formed.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is a strong acid like H2SO4, the reaction would produce CO2, and the resulting solution would have the sulfate salt. But if the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. So, for example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction would produce CaSO4, which is sparingly soluble. So CaSO4 might precipitate. Then, heating CaSO4 wouldn't release B, but perhaps if G is CaCO3, and upon heating, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. But then B would be CO2, which has a melting point way lower than 277 K.

Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something else.

Wait, another angle: The reaction between X and Y produces a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. So B is a solid. So when G is heated, B is released, implying that B is a product of decomposition.

If B has a melting point around 277 K, perhaps it's something like ammonium chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate that releases water upon heating, but that's speculative.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think: suppose G is a carbonate hydroxide, like sodium carbonate decahydrate. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe G is a bicarbonate, which upon heating decomposes into a carbonate and CO2. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O when heated. So B could be Na2CO3, but the melting point of Na2CO3 is higher than 277 K.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is a different compound. Another thought: if Y is an aqueous solution of a salt, and X is a metal, then the reaction could cause a double displacement, forming a precipitate. For example, X could be sodium carbonate, reacting with a solution of calcium chloride. The reaction would produce calcium carbonate precipitate and sodium chloride. Then, upon heating, calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and CO2. But then B would be CO2, which doesn't fit the melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium hydroxide, but that's a strong base, so it would react with an acid Y to produce water and a salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal bicarbonate. When it reacts with an acid, perhaps it produces CO2 and a salt. Then, upon heating, the bicarbonate might decompose into the carbonate, CO2, and H2O. But again, not sure about the melting points.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should try to look for other clues. The problem mentions that the product of X reacting with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product has two O atoms. Let's think about possible reactions.

If X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), the reaction would produce sodium acetate, water, and perhaps release some gas. Wait, but sodium acetate has the formula CH3COONa. That has two O atoms per acetate ion. So maybe the product is a salt with two O atoms from the acid. Wait, no, CH3COOH has two O in the -COOH group. The product would be CH3COO^- Na^+.

Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms. Or maybe the product is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a halogen, like Cl2, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid. The reaction between Cl2 and acetic acid in water might produce chloroacetic acid or other derivatives. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a product with two O atoms.

Wait, another thought: If X is a metal, like sodium, and the keto acid is something like oxalic acid (which has two carboxylic groups), then the reaction would produce a sodium salt. Oxalic acid is H2C2O4. Reacting with Na would produce Na2C2O4 (sodium oxalate), which has four O atoms per formula unit. Hmm, but the product would have more than two O atoms. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the product is something like CO2, which has two O atoms. But how would X reacting with a keto acid produce CO2? That would require a decomposition reaction, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a ketone and some reagent. Wait, but the question says a keto acid, not a ketone. Keto acid has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group, like in the case of pyruvic acid.

So pyruvic acid is CH3COCH2COOH. Reacting with X, perhaps a base, would deprotonate the carboxylic acid to form the conjugate base. The product would be sodium pyruvate (if X is NaOH), which has four O atoms in the pyruvate ion. So that doesn't fit two O atoms.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to approach the problem from the isotopes angle. The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has at least two different isotopes in its constituent elements. So, for example, if X is Cl, which has ^35Cl and ^37Cl isotopes, but in a molecule, maybe it's something like Cl2.

Wait, but Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, and heavier isotopes would affect the molecular mass. But the problem says that when calculating the atomic masses, if multiple instances of an element exist, sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes. So, for example, if X is Cl2, then each Cl atom contributes its isotopic mass. But wait, Cl has two main isotopes: ~75% ^35Cl (mass ~35) and ~25% ^37Cl (mass ~37). So if X is Cl2, each molecule would have two Cl atoms. So the total atomic masses for Cl would be 35 + 37, but what if X has multiple atoms of Cl?

Wait, the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So for each element in X, sum all their lightest and heaviest isotopes. Then add those sums together.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound consisting of two elements, each with a lightest and heaviest isotope. For example, if X has elements like Cl and another element which has, say, hydrogen.

Wait, but another angle: the problem says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So, perhaps X contains two elements, one being the lightest possible and the other being the heaviest possible. But that's unlikely because the elements in a compound are usually not the extremes. Alternatively, perhaps X contains elements with the lightest and heaviest possible isotopes.

Wait, but the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for each element in X, sum all their isotopes (lightest and heaviest) and then add the sums of the lightest and heaviest elements.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about possible substances X that are reagents in organic chemistry. Common ones include NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, Na2CO3, etc. Let's consider these possibilities.

If X is NaOH, it's a base. The elements present are Na, O, H. Wait, but it's a compound, so the elements are Na, O, H. Na is atomic number 11, O is 8, H is 1. So the lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Na (23). But wait, the problem says "lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So if X is NaOH, elements are Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So their cumulative atomic masses would be 1 + 23 = 24. But looking at the options, B is 25, which is close. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH3. But it's not a common reagent in organic chemistry as a base, perhaps. Alternatively, X could be something else.

Wait, another reagent: KMnO4. It's a strong oxidizing agent. The elements are K, Mn, O. K has atomic number 19, Mn is 25, O is 8. So the lightest element is O (8), and the heaviest is Mn (55). So cumulative atomic mass would be 8 + 55 = 63. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, X could be CH3COOH (acetic acid), but it's a liquid, not a reagent that reacts violently with another liquid.

Wait, another idea: X could be a metal like Mg. But Mg reacts with acids to produce H2 gas. But earlier we thought H2 doesn't fit the W description.

Wait, perhaps X is something like H2O2. It's used in organic reactions, but I'm not sure. When H2O2 reacts with something, it can produce O2 gas. Let's see: H2O2 decomposes into H2O and O2. O2 is a possible W. So for H2O2, the elements are H and O. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is O (16). So cumulative atomic mass is 1 + 16 = 17. Not matching the options.

Hmm. Another reagent is Na2SO4 (sodium sulfate). It's used in some reactions. The elements are Na, S, O. Lightest is O (16), heaviest is S (32). So 16 +32 =48. Not matching options.

Wait, maybe X is NH4Cl. Reacts with something? Not sure. The elements are N, H, Cl. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). So 1 +35.5=36.5. Closest option is A)35. But the options are integers, so perhaps rounding is involved.

But wait, the problem says to sum all isotopes. So for each element in X, sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes present. So, for example, if X is Cl2, each Cl atom could be ^35Cl or ^37Cl. So each molecule has two Cl atoms, each with different isotopes. But the question says to sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes. So, for Cl, the lightest isotope is ^35Cl (mass 35) and the heaviest is ^37Cl (37). So sum for Cl is 35 + 37 =72. But wait, in a molecule, you have two Cl atoms, each possibly being either isotope. But the problem states to sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes present in X. So perhaps if X has both isotopes, you add their masses.

Wait, but if X is a compound containing, say, Cl and another element, the cumulative atomic masses would be the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So for example, if X is Cl2, the only element is Cl. The lightest and heaviest are the same (Cl), so sum is 35 +37 =72. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two different elements, each having light and heavy isotopes. Let's say X is NaCl. Then elements are Na and Cl. The lightest element is Na (11th element, mass around 23) and Cl (17th, mass around 35). Wait, no, Na is lighter than Cl. So the lightest element in X is Na (mass 23), the heaviest is Cl (35). So sum is 23 +35=58. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is KCl, then K is 19th element (mass ~39), Cl is 17th (~35). So the heaviest is K, lightest is Cl. Sum is 35 +39=74. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: Maybe X is something like CCl4. The elements are C and Cl. Lightest is C (mass 12), heaviest is Cl (35). Sum would be 12 +35=47. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the initial part. The reaction of X with Y releases gas W with same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So, W could be CO2, O2, N2, NO, etc.

If W is O2, then each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that fits.

So, if X is a carbonate (like Na2CO3) and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce CO2 gas. Then the precipitate G would be a salt, perhaps the sulfate if Y is H2SO4.

Wait, when Na2CO3 reacts with H2SO4, the reaction is:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, the product is Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. So perhaps Y is a different acid, like HCl. But HCl is a liquid, but when Na2CO3 reacts with HCl, it produces CO2, NaCl, and water. NaCl is soluble, so again no precipitate.

Hmm, perhaps Y is not an acid but something else. Maybe Y is water, but then I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide. For example, FeS reacting with H2SO4 would produce H2S gas. But earlier, that doesn't fit the W description.

Wait, another idea: X could be a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3 reacts with H2SO4 to produce CO2, Na2SO4, and H2O. Again, no precipitate if the products are soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that forms a precipitate with X. For example, X is AgNO3, and Y is NaCl. The reaction would produce AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. Then, the gas W would be none, but perhaps some other reaction.

Wait, but then W would not be involved. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, X could be a metal carbonate reacting with a solution of a metal hydroxide, leading to a precipitate. I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should proceed to the part where I have to find the cumulative atomic masses.

The problem says that the product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps the reaction is between X and a keto acid to form a salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, if X is NaOH and the keto acid is something like acetic acid (which has two O in the COOH group), the product would be sodium acetate, which has two O in the acetate ion. So, sodium acetate is CH3COO^- Na^+, which has two O in the acetate. So that fits.

So, if X is NaOH, then the elements in X are Na, O, H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So their sum is 1 + 23 =24. But the options don't have 24. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So, if X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 24. But the options don't have 24. The closest is option B)25. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe X is not NaOH but something else. Let me think. If X is KOH, then elements are K (39), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 40. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Ca(OH)2. Then elements are Ca (40), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Ca (40). Sum is41. Still not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a metal with a heavier isotope, like Mg. Mg has isotopes ^24Mg, ^25Mg, and ^26Mg. The lightest isotope is ^24Mg, the heaviest ^26Mg. So, if X is Mg, then the cumulative atomic masses would be 24 +26=50. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, X could be a diatomic molecule like O2, but then it's an element, not a compound. But the problem says X is a substance, so it could be an element.

Wait, let's think about the isotopes again. If X is a molecule composed of two elements, each contributing isotopes. For example, H2O. Hydrogen can be ^1H and deuterium (^2H), and oxygen is ^16O, ^17O, ^18O. So the lightest element in X is H (1), heaviest is O (16). So sum is 17. Not matching options.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound like CH4. Then elements are C (12) and H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12). Sum is 13. Not an option.

Another possibility: X is NH3. Elements N (14) and H (1). Sum is 15. Not an option.

Alternatively, X could be CCl4. Elements C (12), Cl (35). Sum is 47. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of a different approach. Another angle: The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So, perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms. Like CO2, which has two O atoms. But how would X and a keto acid produce CO2? Maybe through decarboxylation.

Wait, decarboxylation is the loss of CO2 from a carboxylic acid. For example, heating a beta-keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) can lead to loss of CO2, producing a ketone. So if X is a base like NaOH, and the keto acid is a beta-keto acid, the reaction under heat could produce CO2. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of X with a keto acid forms a salt with two O atoms. For example, if the keto acid is a dicarboxylic acid, and X is a base, the product would be a salt with two O atoms per formula unit. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the product has two oxygen atoms. So it could be something like H2O2, which has two O atoms. But how would X and a keto acid produce H2O2? Unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonate, which has three O per formula unit. No, that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should try to make an educated guess based on the options provided and the information I have.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Earlier, I thought X might be NaOH, leading to a sum of 24, which is near option B)25. But that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, if X is a compound like KNO3 (potassium nitrate). The elements are K (39), N (14), O (16). Lightest element is N (14), heaviest is K (39). Sum is 14+39=53. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound containing C and O, like CO2. Then, elements are C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the isotopes. The problem says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, perhaps X has two elements, one of which has both light and heavy isotopes. For example, if X is H2O, and one H is deuterium (heavier isotope). So, the elements are H and O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not matching.

Wait, another angle: The cumulative atomic masses are summed for all the lighter and heavier isotopes present in X. So, if X has multiple isotopes, perhaps for each element in X, you sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes, then add those sums together for all elements.

For example, if X is H2O, and the hydrogen has ^1H and ^2H (deuterium), then for H, the lightest is 1, heaviest is 2. For O, the lightest is 16, heaviest is 18. So sum for H:1+2=3; O:16+18=34. Total sum would be 3 +34=37. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is Cl2, then each Cl has isotopes ^35Cl and ^37Cl. So for Cl, sum is 35+37=72. If X is Cl2, but no other elements, then total sum is 72. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule like NO. Elements are N and O. N's lightest isotope is ^14N (mass 14), heaviest ^15N (mass 15). O's lightest is ^16O (mass16), heaviest ^18O (mass18). So for N:14+15=29; O:16+18=34. Sum is 29+34=63. Not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X is something else. Another possibility: X is a carbonate, say Na2CO3. The elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). The lightest is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35. Option A is 35. That's a possible match.

So, if X is Na2CO3, which is sodium carbonate, the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). So 12 +23 =35. Which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought the product with a keto acid would have two O atoms, which would fit with sodium carbonate reacting as a base. For example, sodium carbonate and a keto acid like acetic acid would produce sodium acetate, which has two O atoms in the acetate ion. That makes sense.

So, perhaps X is sodium carbonate. Then, when it reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms, which fits the description.

So, for the cumulative atomic masses, the lightest element in X is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35. So the answer would be option A)35.

But wait, the question says to sum all the lighter and heavier isotopes present in X. So for each element in X, sum the lightest and heaviest isotopes. Then add those sums for all elements.

Wait, in Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O.

- For Na: the lightest isotope is ^23Na (mass 23), heaviest is ^25Na (mass 25). So sum is 23 +25 =48.
- For C: lightest is ^12C (12), heaviest is ^14C (14). Sum is 12+14=26.
- For O: lightest is ^16O (16), heaviest is ^18O (18). Sum is 16+18=34.

Wait, no, the question says to sum the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. It says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So, the lightest element (by atomic number) and the heaviest element in X, regardless of isotopes.

So, in Na2CO3, the elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). The lightest element is C (12), the heaviest is Na (23). So their masses are 12 +23 =35. So option A)35.

That makes sense. So the answer would be option A.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, given its properties and reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (22 protons, 22 neutrons) or O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons). CO₂ aligns well with the reaction context, as it is produced when a carbonate reacts with an acid.

2. **Substance X**: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing CO₂ gas, and forms a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (≈4°C). This suggests that X could be a carbonate, such as sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), which reacts with an acid to produce CO₂ and a precipitate.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) reacts with a keto acid (e.g., acetic acid) to form a salt (e.g., sodium acetate), which contains 2 oxygen atoms in the acetate ion.

4. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: X must contain at least two elements. For Na₂CO₃, the elements are Na (sodium), C (carbon), and O (oxygen). The lightest element is C (atomic mass ≈12), and the heaviest is Na (atomic mass ≈23). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements are:

   \[
   12 + 23 = 35
   \]

Thus, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are 35.
