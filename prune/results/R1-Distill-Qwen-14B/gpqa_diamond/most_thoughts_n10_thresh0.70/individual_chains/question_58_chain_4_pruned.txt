Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's like a way to handle the mathematical problems that arise when you try to calculate certain physical quantities. But wait, do all these theories need regularization?

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think superstring theory is a type of string theory, which aims to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity. String theories are quantum theories, so they probably deal with similar issues as other quantum field theories. But wait, superstring theory might have some advantages. Oh right, string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same types of divergences that other quantum field theories do. Because in string theory, particles are not point-like but are extended, so maybe the divergences are tamed. That could mean that superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's already finite?

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I remember that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. But wait, does that affect regularization? No,
