Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts here, but let's try to think it through.

The problem is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. The question is about the angle between the directions of these two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and conservation laws must apply—like conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me read the question again carefully. So, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is also moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate to produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one in the upper-right, the other in the lower-right. So, their paths are symmetric in some way.

Wait, Lorentz factor is just gamma, right? So gamma_e is 4 for the electron and gamma_p is 2 for the positron. But wait, the positron is a particle with the same mass as the electron but opposite charge. Since it's moving from the right, its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electron.

Let me think about their momenta. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. Oh wait, velocity is a vector, so the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction. So if I set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-axis, then the positron is moving along the negative x-axis.

First, I should calculate the total energy and momentum before the collision. Because in any annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved.

So for the electron: gamma_e =4. The rest mass of an electron is m_e, so its total energy E_e = gamma_e * m_e * c^2. Similarly, the positron's energy E_p = gamma_p * m_e * c^2, since it has the same mass.

Wait, but wait—the positron's velocity is actually opposite to the electron's. So the positron's velocity is to the left if the electron is moving to the right. So when considering momentum, the positron's momentum will be in the opposite direction.
