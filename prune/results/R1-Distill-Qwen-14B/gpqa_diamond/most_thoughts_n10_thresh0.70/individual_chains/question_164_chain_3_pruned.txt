Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on my binary star dynamics, but I'll try to remember.

Alright, the question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. Oh wait, the period here is the time between two primary eclipses. So that's the orbital period of the binary system.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. And for system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. The question is about how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. I remember that the mass of a binary system is the sum of the masses of the two stars.

Wait, but how do the radial velocities relate to the masses? Oh right, in a binary system, each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star will be closer to the center, so it has a smaller orbit and hence a smaller velocity amplitude. Right, because velocity is inversely proportional to the mass in this scenario.

So the radial velocity amplitude (K) of each star is related to the mass ratio. Let me think of the formula. The mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary. So q = M_secondary / M_primary.

And the velocity semi-amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses. So K_primary = (M_secondary / (M_primary + M_secondary)) * (V_primary + V_secondary) / (1 + q). Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Alternatively, the ratio of the velocities is equal to the inverse ratio of the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1, right? Because the more massive star moves slower.

Wait, let me get this straight. The two stars orbit the center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit. So the velocity is proportional to the size of the orbit. So if M1 is the mass of the primary and M2 the secondary, then M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of their orbits. So a1/a2 = M
