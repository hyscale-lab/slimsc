Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let's read it carefully. 

The question is about binary star systems and their masses. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, they've measured the radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. 

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. They consider the mass of a system as the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars based on their Doppler shifts. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's orbiting a common center of mass closer to it. So the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass.

Wait, right. The mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the velocity amplitudes of the two stars to their masses and the orbital period. The formula I think is:

M2^3 / (M1 + M2)^2 = (P * (K1)^3) / (2Ï€ G)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. So the more massive star has a smaller K.

Wait, another approach: the mass function for each star. The mass function for each star in a binary system is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since both stars are in the same system, their mass functions are related. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, another thought: the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses. So if star A has velocity K_A and star B has K_B, then M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A.

Because in a binary system, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital separation. And since velocity is
