Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a star with certain characteristicsâ€”radius 1.5 solar radii and mass 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on the surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The main part is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Observers notice that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels can be described using the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation relates the populations of different energy levels based on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) and E is the energy of each level. Since the problem is talking about the ratio of the number of atoms, I assume they're considering the ratio of level 2 to level 1 or vice versa.

Wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. Let me think: Teff is the effective temperature, which for a star is related to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, but in this case, it's the temperature influencing the ionization and excitation of atoms in the photosphere.

So, when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, what's the actual temperature of the spots? In reality, starspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. But maybe in this problem, they're considering the effective temperature of the entire star as 5500 K instead of the spotted and unspotted regions. Or perhaps the effective temperature is an average. Hmm, the question says when the star's surface is not covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the overall average Teff is 5500 K. But I'm not sure how that affects the photospheric conditions. Since the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, perhaps each region (spot and non-spot) is in LTE, but when averaged, the effective temperature is 5500 K. Or maybe the entire photosphere is considered at 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question states that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But when the spots are present, 40% of the surface is cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K? Or is the entire photosphere at 5500 K? I think it's the former because when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, and the rest is the same as before. But the overall effective temperature is a weighted average, so the star's luminosity changes because a fraction of its surface is emitting at a lower temperature.

But in this problem, the main point is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Let's consider the two scenarios: no spots (Teff 6000 K) and spots (Teff 5500 K). Wait, no, actually, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, but is the photospheric temperature the same as Teff? Or is the Teff an average, while the photosphere has varying temperatures?

Wait, the question says: when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 4
