Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the relationship is N ∝ 1/plx^5, where N is the number of stars. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options given are A to D, with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs), right? So distance d is 1/plx. That's important because I need to relate parallax to distance.

Wait, the problem gives N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me write this down. So N = k * (1 / plx^5), where k is some constant of proportionality. But I need to express this in terms of distance, r, which is the same as d. Since d = 1/plx, I can substitute plx with 1/d. So plx = 1/d, which means 1/plx = d. Wait, no, plx is 1/d, so 1/plx would be d.

Wait no, wait. Let's correct that. The parallax in arcseconds (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs (d). So plx = 1/d. Therefore, d = 1/plx. So if I have plx, I can find d as 1 over plx. So if I have an expression with plx, I can express it in terms of d.

Given that N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx = 1/d into that gives:

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So it's the rate of change of N with respect to d, which would be dN/dr.

Wait, but wait a second. N ∝ d^5 means that N = C * d^5,
