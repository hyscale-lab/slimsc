Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember that when a nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and they have kinetic energy because of the mass defect. But wait, the question is about comparing the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. 

Let me try to break this down. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. When it fissions, it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. So, if the less massive one is m, the other is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, M was the initial mass, right? So M = initial rest mass, which is 300 GeV/c². But wait, the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. Since M is 300 GeV/c², the sum is 0.99 * 300 GeV/c², which is 297 GeV/c². 

So, the two fragments' rest masses add up to 297 GeV/c². So, m + 2m = 3m = 297 GeV/c² → m = 99 GeV/c². So the two fragments have rest masses of 99 GeV/c² and 198 GeV/c². 

Wait, but the initial rest mass was 300
