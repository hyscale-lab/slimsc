Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how the flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are still going as usual. I need to find the ratio of the fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

Wait, first, I should recall what the pp-III branch is. I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch involves reactions that produce deuterium, and then there's pp-II and pp-III, which might involve higher energy steps. Oh right, the pp-III branch is where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form helium-4, releasing a lot of energy, including neutrinos.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, that means the reactions producing neutrinos from that branch would stop. I think the neutrinos from the Sun come mainly from two processes: the dominant one is the pp-III branch, which produces a lot of high-energy neutrinos, and then there's the CNO cycle, which contributes a smaller amount. Oh wait, no, the CNO cycle is more prevalent in hotter stars, but the Sun relies mostly on the proton-proton chain. Hmm.

Wait, the main neutrinos we detect from the Sun are from the pp-III process, right? Like, the Beryllium-7 process, where a proton captures a helium-3 to make beryllium-7, which then decays into a positron and a neutron, releasing a neutrino. Those neutrinos are high-energy, around 1 MeV or so. So if the pp-III branch stops, then that source of neutrinos would drop.

But wait, the question is about two specific energy bands. So, the pp-III produces neutrinos of a certain energy range. What's the typical energy of those neutrinos?

I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have energies around 0.5 to
