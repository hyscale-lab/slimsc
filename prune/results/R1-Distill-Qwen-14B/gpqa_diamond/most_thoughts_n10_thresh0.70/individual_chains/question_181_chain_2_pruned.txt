Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in two different energy bands. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. Oh wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but let me think this through.

So, the Sun's core fusion is the pp chain, which has different branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. I think the main branch is pp-I, which is the dominant process. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor. If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, how does that affect neutrino production?

Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun. The pp-III branch probably contributes to high-energy neutrinos. Wait, the neutrinos we detect are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch, which produces electron neutrinos. But wait, there are also other neutrino sources like the CNO cycle, but I think the pp chain is more dominant in terms of number.

But the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what determines the energy of the neutrinos? I remember that higher-energy neutrinos come from higher temperatures or more energetic reactions. The pp-III branch might be producing higher-energy neutrinos compared to the main pp-I branch.

Wait, the pp-III branch isn't the main one. The pp-I is the main, and it produces lower-energy neutrinos, whereas the pp-III might produce higher-energy ones. Because if the pp-III stops, the flux from that source would drop, but the pp-I continues.

So before the pp-III stops, both branches contribute. After it stops, only pp-I is producing neutrinos. So in each energy band, the flux would change based on how much each branch contributes.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2. So I need to find out how much each band is affected by the pp-III branch stopping.

If pp-III primarily contributes to higher-energy neutrinos, then band 2 (800-900 keV) would have a significant contribution from pp-III. Band 1 (700-800) might have a mix of contributions from both branches, but maybe less from
