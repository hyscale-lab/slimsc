Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, diatomic molecules are two atoms bonded together, right. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that this model considers both the rotation and vibration of the molecule. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of this photon. The options are all different momenta, so I'll have to calculate which one it is.

The given data includes the masses of atoms X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. 

Wait, the question is about transitioning from the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state refers to the lowest energy state, which in the rotation-vibration model would be the state with the lowest quantum numbers. So, the initial state is the ground state, and the photon causes a transition to the next possible state with the lowest energy. That probably means the first excited state.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The energy levels for vibration are quantized, and similarly for rotation. The fundamental state (v=0, J=0) is the lowest. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either go to a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), whichever requires less energy.

But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the least energy increase. I think that would be the first excited state with the lowest energy, which might involve a vibrational or rotational transition. But I'm a bit confused here. Or maybe it's a transition to the next possible state, which could be a combination of both.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground state, and the photon is absorbed in such a way that it excites the molecule to the next energy level, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, whichever requires less energy. I'll need to calculate the energies for these transitions.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, how does the energy split work? The energy levels are given by E = ħω(v) + (something for rotation). Or maybe it's a combination. But I might be mixing different models. Let me think again.

The quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotation and vibration. The total energy is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) ħ ω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy is given by E_J = (J (J+1) / 2I) ħ², where I is the moment of inertia and J is the rotational quantum number.

But when the molecule is in the fundamental state, v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would either be v=1 or J=1. Which transition requires less energy? Let's compute both.

First, the vibrational energy difference when v increases from 0 to 1: ΔE_v = E_v(1) - E_v(0) = (1 + 0.5)ħω - (0 + 0.5)ħω = (0.5)ħω.

Wait, more accurately, E_v = (v + ½)ħω, so the change from v=0 to v=1 is (1.5-0.5)ħω = ħω.

Now, the rotational energy change when J goes from 0 to 1: E_J = [J(J+1) / (2I)] ħ². So for J=1, it's (2)/(2I) ħ² = (1/I) ħ². For J=0, it's zero. So the change is E_J = (1/(2I)) * ħ² * (J(J+1)) for J=1 minus J=0. Wait, let me compute that correctly.

E_J for J=0 is 0. For J=1, E_J = (1*(1+1))/(2I) ħ² = (2)/(2I) ħ² = (1/I) ħ².

So the rotational energy difference is (1/I) ħ².

Which of these is smaller, the vibrational or rotational energy difference? Because the photon needs to supply the energy difference, and the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which transition requires less energy.

So I need to calculate both ΔE_v and ΔE_J and see which is smaller.

Let me compute both.

First, calculate ΔE_v = ħ ω.

I know ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Angular frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_v = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = approximately 4.218e-20 J.

Now, calculate ΔE_J = (ħ²) / I.

I need to find I, the moment of inertia. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms.

μ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y).

Masses are given as Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert this to kilograms. 1 amu is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg·m².

Now, calculate ΔE_J = ħ² / I.

ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68, but more accurately, (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Wait, no, wait—actually, the units might be a bit different. Let me think. ħ squared is (J·s)^2, and I is kg·m², so ħ² over I has units (J² s²)/(kg m²) ) → ( (kg² m²/s² s²) ) / (kg m²) ) → kg m² s^-2.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the value.

ΔE_J = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (1.2064e-46 )

Let me compute this:

(1.05457e-34)^2 = approx (1.05e-34)^2 = 1.10e-68? Let me do it more precisely:

1.05457e-34 squared:

1.05457^2 ≈ (1.05)^2 =1.1025, but more accurately:

1.05457 *1.05457: 1.05457 *1 =1.05457, 1.05457 * 0.05 = approx 0.0527, so adding gives about 1.1073. So approximately 1.11e-68 J² s².

Wait, wait, no. I think I made a mistake here. ħ is in J·s, so ħ squared is (J s)^2. So when you divide by I (kg m^2), the units are (J² s²) / (kg m²). Let me think about the units of E_J.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just compute the numerical value.

So, ΔE_J = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2064e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68) / (1.2064e-46) = approximately (1.112 / 1.2064
