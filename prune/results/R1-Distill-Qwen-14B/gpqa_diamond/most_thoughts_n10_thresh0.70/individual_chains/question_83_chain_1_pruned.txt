Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, first, let me get the big picture. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is where the moles of base equal the moles of acid. At equivalence, the solution will be the conjugate base of acetic acid, which is acetate, and since it's a weak base, the solution will be basic. But before that, at 25% titration, some of the acid has been neutralized.

So, first, let me figure out the initial concentrations after dilution.

Original volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2.

So, initial concentration (M1) is 0.05 M, volume (V1) is 20 cm³. Diluted volume (V2) is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40 * 0.05 * 20? Wait, no, wait, 0.05 *20 = 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration decreases. So yes, 0.05 M * 20 = n, then divided by 40 gives 0.025 M.

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M. Now, the next step is to find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration.

But wait, first, what's the equivalence point? Because to find 25% titration, I need to know the amount of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

Original volume is 20 cm³ = 0.02 L. Initial moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, but the moles remain the same because we're only adding water. So moles of acetic acid after dilution is still 0.001 mol.

Wait, but wait, no.
