Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. Oh right, it's probably a molecule with some double bonds and branching. But maybe the exact structure isn't critical for this calculation. 

The question provides the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to produce separate atoms, right? So for carbon, it's the bond energy for a C-C bond. Wait, no, but wait, the given bond energies are for various bonds. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy needed to convert an element into its atoms, so for carbon, that would be the bond energy for a C-C bond, which is given as 200 kJ/mol. Wait, but wait, the data says the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, maybe I'm confused. Because bond energy of C-C is 200 kJ/mol. So if the problem gives both, perhaps I should pay attention to which one to use.

Wait, but enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using bond energies. The formula is: Enthalpy of formation = [sum of bond energies
