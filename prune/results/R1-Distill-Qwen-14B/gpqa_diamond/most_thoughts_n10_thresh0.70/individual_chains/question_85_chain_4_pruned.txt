Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Let's see what the question says.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo. Oh, and they're in circular orbits.

The question mentions transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, transit method measures the drop in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star, which gives the planet's radius. Radial velocity detects the Doppler shift due to the star's movement from the planet's gravity, giving the mass. But wait, I'm not sure if the RV data here is used for anything else. The question is about equilibrium temperatures, so maybe RV isn't directly needed for that.

Equilibrium temperature... I remember it's calculated using the formula T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So the formula simplifies. Oh wait, no, because e is zero, the (1+e) term goes away. So T_eq depends on the star's temperature, the planet's distance, and the albedo.

Wait, the albedos are the same, so that cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 would be the square root of (R_star/(2a1)) divided by sqrt(R_star/(2a2)), but wait, no, because the formula is T_eq proportional to (Teff * sqrt(R_star/(2a))) ) times ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). Since albedos are same, (1-A) is same, so the ratio depends on sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) for each planet.

But wait, I don't have the orbital distances (a) of the planets. Hmm, the problem gives RV data. The RV method gives the velocity amplitude, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital distance. So the RV shift (the Doppler shift) can be used to find the mass of the planet and the distance. Oh, but wait, the RV method gives the mass in terms of the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the
