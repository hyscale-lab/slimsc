Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let me start by understanding the target molecule and the starting material.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking that down, it's a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group, and the other is a formyl group (carbaldehyde).

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me visualize it. So, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring, and at one position, there's a CH2 group attached. One end of this CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane (so it's a cyclohexyl group), and the other end has an OH (hydroxy). Additionally, the same carbon that has the CH2-cyclohexyl and OH groups is also attached to a formyl group (CHO). Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the cyclohexane ring has a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group, and another substituent which is a formyl group. So, the molecule is something like cyclohexane with a -(CH2) group where one CH2 connects to a cyclohexyl and the other to an OH, and on the same carbon, a CHO group? Wait, that might not be possible because a carbon can't have more than four bonds. Let me think again.

Let me try to draw the structure mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane. Attached to one of its carbons is a group: (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, so CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl might be on the same carbon. But wait, that would be two substituents on the same carbon. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like cyclohexane with a substituent that is a methyl group, which is connected to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydro
