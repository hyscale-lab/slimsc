Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question here. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? So the Sun's main source of energy is the fusion of protons into helium, and the pp chain has a few steps. I remember that the pp-I and pp-II branches produce different neutrinos. Oh wait, right, the pp-III branch produces a lot of high-energy neutrinos, like the ones in the 700-800 keV range.

So the scenario is that the pp-III branch stops 8.5 minutes ago. But all other reactions remain as they were. Oh wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we on Earth wouldn't notice the change in neutrino flux right away. But since the question is about the current flux, maybe we should consider the effects after that time.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the current flux. So, if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have been emitted until that time. But after that, they're not being produced. So the neutrino flux would decrease for the energies produced by pp-III.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of two energy bands: band
