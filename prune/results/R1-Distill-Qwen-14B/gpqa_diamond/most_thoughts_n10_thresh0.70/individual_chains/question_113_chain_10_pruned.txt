Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the characterization data provided. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll take each piece of data one by one and see what I can deduce.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretches. A very broad peak suggests that there's a hydrogen bond, which is common in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol because carboxylic acids tend to have even broader and possibly different peaks, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group in a ketone or something else, but usually, ketones don't have O-H. Hmm, so probably an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The peak at 1700 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than the typical carbonyl, so maybe a conjugated carbonyl or something else. Wait, could it be an aromatic ring? Or maybe an absorption from another functional group. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or maybe it's an amide or something else. Let me think. Another possibility: the 1700 is a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester), and the 1650 is maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretch? But wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600, so 1650 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe an conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester, where the carbonyl is conjugated with another group, maybe an electron-withdrawing group which could lower the wavenumber a bit. Or perhaps the 1650 is an absorption from another functional group, like an amide, but the presence of an
