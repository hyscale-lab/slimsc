Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts.

Let me start by breaking down each piece of information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because of the hydrogen bonding. For example, alcohols or carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches. The other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which I remember is characteristic of carbonyl groups. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The peak at 1650 might correspond to something else. Could it be an aromatic ring (C=C) stretching? Or maybe an amide or another carbonyl-related group? Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Another possibility is that it's a carbonyl with some sort of conjugation, like an ester or a conjugated ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests there's an alkene group in the molecule. So, the compound likely has both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

Looking at the Mass Spectrometry part: a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to figure out what that corresponds to. Common fragments at m/z 45 could be something like CH3COO- (if it's an ester) but wait, that would be 60. Or maybe something else. Let me think. 45 is equal to 45 g/mol. Let's see, possible fragments: maybe a CH3CO (acetyl group) would be 43, but that's close. Wait, maybe it's a different fragment. Alternatively, it could be (CH2)2O, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*4 + 16 = 24 +4 +16=44? Hmm, no. Wait, 45 would be C3H7O? No, that's not a common fragment. Alternatively, the molecular ion might have lost a substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a ketone or an ester.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So, the molecular weight would be: for C6H10O2, it's (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. Let me check the others:

C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100
C6H10O: 72+10+16=98
C6H12O2:72+12+32=116.

Hmm, so the mass spec fragment at 45 is likely a fragment of the molecular ion. Let me think, if the molecular ion is, say, 114 (C6H10O2), losing a fragment of 45 would leave 69. But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, the fragment itself is 45. So, what could give a mass of 45 in the molecule?

Option C is C6H10O2. So the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's see. If the compound has a carbonyl group, maybe an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So, an ester would have both an O in the ester linkage and a carbonyl.

Wait, another point: the broad peak in IR at 3000 cm-1. If it's a broad peak, that's more likely an O-H group. But some esters don't have O-H. Wait, wait. If it's an ester, the O-H is not present unless it's an acid. Wait, no. Esters are O-R-CO-O-R, but they don't have an O-H. Then why is there a broad peak?

Wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch in IR. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. But
