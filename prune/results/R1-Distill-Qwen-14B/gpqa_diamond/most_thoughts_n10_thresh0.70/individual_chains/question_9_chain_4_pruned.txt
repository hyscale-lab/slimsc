Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules is classified based on the operations that leave the molecule looking the same. The C3h point group comes to mind. I think C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). Oh wait, right, the h stands for horizontal, so there's a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the main rotation axis.

So the question is asking which of the four options has this C3h symmetry. Let me look at each molecule one by one.

The options are:
A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

Wait, I should probably think about each molecule's structure.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a substituent on boron. So, the molecule is trigonal planar around boron, I think. Wait, no, each isopropyl group is a bulky substituent. So, if all three substituents are the same, then the molecule should have a certain symmetry. If they are all the same groups attached to a central atom, then maybe it's symmetric. Since there are three identical groups arranged symmetrically around the central atom, perhaps it has a three-fold rotation axis. But what about mirror planes?

Wait, triisopropyl borate. Let me try to visualize it. Boron is in the center, attached to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is symmetric, but the arrangement around boron would determine the overall symmetry. Since all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically, the molecule should have a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal
