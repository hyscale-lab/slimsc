Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules relates to their point groups. C3h symmetry... wait, what's that exactly? Oh right, the C3h point group has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane cutting through it.

The options are four different molecules. Let me go through each one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I think that's a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. The structure is something like B with three i-Pr groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetrical themselves, right? So the molecule might have some symmetry. Since there are three identical groups arranged symmetrically around the boron, maybe it has a trigonal planar structure. Trigonal planar often has C3v symmetry, but wait, C3h is different. Hmm, maybe if it's not just a planar structure but has some kind of mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Wait, if the groups are in a plane and the mirror is through the boron and perpendicular, then perhaps it's C3h. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h? No, wait, D3h is for something else. I'm a bit confused here.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, right? It's got a structure that's like a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. Wait, no, I think it's a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane structure. So it's a bridged molecule, and I remember that quinuclidine has a C3 symmetry. Because the three bridgeheads are arranged symmetrically. But does it have a mirror plane as well? Wait, quinuclidine's structureâ€”does it have a plane of symmetry? I think it does. If you look down the bridge, there's a plane that goes through the middle. So C3h symmetry would make sense. But wait, I'm not so sure. I think it's more like a C3v symmetry perhaps. Or wait, maybe C3h? I'm getting mixed up.

Third option: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-
