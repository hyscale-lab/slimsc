Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the potential energy in an electric system comes from the interactions between charges. Since all the charges are the same sign, they'll repel each other, which means their potential energy will be positive. The system is isolated, so we don't have to worry about external fields, just the interactions between these charges.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So that's one charge at the center, and the other 12 are all at the same distance from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P. But also, each of those 12 is 2 meters apart from the 13th charge? Or wait, no—the 13th is at P, so each of the 12 is 2m from P, but the distance between the 12 charges themselves could vary, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe each of the 12 is located on a sphere of radius 2m around P, but their exact positions on the sphere can vary.

Wait, but for minimum energy, wouldn't the charges arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy? Since they're identical and repel each other, the configuration with the lowest potential energy would be the most spread out. But wait, wait a minute—if the charges are constrained to be at 2m from P, but not fixed in position otherwise, then perhaps the most stable configuration is when they are as far apart as possible from each other. So maybe they're placed on the surface of a sphere, each as far as possible from the others. But wait, in that case, their mutual distances would vary, but for potential energy calculations, we might have to sum all pairwise interactions.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the potential energy contributions. The system's total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between
