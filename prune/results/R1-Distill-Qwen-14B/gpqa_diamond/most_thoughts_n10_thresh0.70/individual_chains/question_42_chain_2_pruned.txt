Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, it's about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. Let me try to break it down.

So, the problem says there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They've been discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I don't think that's directly relevant here; probably just context.

The given data points are:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So, T2/T3 = 2.3.
- The mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35.
- All planets have an albedo of 0.3, same as Earth.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So, we need to find Period3 / Period1.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D^2)]^0.25

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, in this case, all three planets have the same star, right? Because it's a system of three exoplanets. So L and σ are the same for all.

So assuming the star's luminosity is the same for all planets, we can model the equilibrium temperature based on their distances.

Wait, but wait another thing, the equilibrium temperature formula can be approximated as T ∝ (L (1 - a))^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Because when you take D squared under the square root, it's D^0.5. So, T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star.

So, if T1 / T2 = 1.4, then:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (D2)/(D1) )^(1/2) ) ?

Wait, wait, let me think. Let's write it correctly. Let me rearrange the formula.

Equilibrium temperature: T = [ (L(1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^0.25

Which can be written as T ∝ (L)^0.25 (1 - a)^0.25 / D^0.5

Since L and (1 - a) are same for all planets, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D). So,

T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D).

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Wait, let me see.

Wait, T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2), where k is a constant.

So, T1 / T2 = (k/sqrt(D1)) / (k/sqrt(D2)) ) = sqrt(D2/D1).

So, T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) → so, D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2.

Given T1/T2 is 1.4, so D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 ≈ 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So,

T2 / T3 = sqrt(D3/D2) → (2.3)^2 = D3/D2 → D3 = (2.3)^2 * D2 = 5.29 * D2.

So, substituting D2, D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1 ≈ let's calculate that.

5.29 * 1.96: Let me compute that.

5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is approximately 0.57. So total about 10.37. So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

So, the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Wait, but wait, because the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. The law states that (P^2) / (a^3) = constant, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star), and P is the orbital period. Assuming the same star for all planets, the mass of the star (M) is the same.

Kepler's third law is P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a³. So for the same star, P² is proportional to a³. So, P ∝ a^(3/2).

So, the ratio P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2). Wait, because P is proportional to a^(3/2). So, since D is the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbits, which the problem states), D is the same as a.

So, P3/P1 = (D3/D1
