Okay, so I've got this question about light emission and colors. Hmm, let me think. The question says a textile dye with a conjugated pi-electron system emits light at 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember something about the complementary color. Oh right, when a substance emits light of a certain color, it's because it absorbed the complementary color. So if it's emitting, say, red, it must have absorbed the opposite color on the spectrum.

But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. Oh no, wait, no. Wait, the dye emits light when it's excited, but actually, I think that when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited, and then when it drops back to the ground state, it emits light. So the emitted light's energy is related to the energy gap of the molecule. 

But the question is about the color absorbed. So the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap. So the energy of the absorbed light would be higher than the emitted light? Or maybe the same? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, no. When the dye absorbs light, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then when it relaxes, it emits light. So the energy of the absorbed light is the energy gap between the ground and excited states. But the emitted light is when it drops. So the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed photon? Or is it different? 

Wait, no, that's not right. Because sometimes the energy difference between the states could mean that the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.
