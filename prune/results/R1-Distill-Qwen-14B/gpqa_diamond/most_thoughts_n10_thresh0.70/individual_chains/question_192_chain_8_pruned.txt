Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. Alright, the setup is a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down.

So the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, so s is the separation between the two centers. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R since it's inside. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. Both l and L are greater than R, meaning P is outside both the conductor and the cavity. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors are important in electrostatics. So when a conductor is uncharged and placed in an electric field, charges redistribute. Wait, but in this case, the conductor is uncharged but there's a charge inside a cavity. Oh right, charges in cavities can influence the conductor's charges.

Wait, how does a charge inside a cavity affect the conductor? I recall that when a conductor has a cavity with a charge, charges will be induced on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. Oh, right, when you have a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to +q, and the outer surface will have no charge because the conductor as a whole is neutral. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so if the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q, and since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have +q? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So any induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces must sum to zero.

Wait, no. The conductor is neutral. So the sum of the inner and outer surface charges is zero. So if the charge inside the cavity is +q, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's inner wall) must have -q. Then the outer surface, since the conductor is neutral, would have +q. Because the total charge is zero: inner is -q, so outer must be +q, but wait, that would make the total +q, which can't be. Wait, maybe I got it wrong.

Wait, no. The conductor is neutral. So the total charge is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have -q, to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface would have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero: inner is -q, so outer must be +q. But wait, that adds up to zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense. So the outer surface has +q, the inner has -q.

Wait, but the conductor was uncharged. So if the cavity has +q, the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface, being the rest of the conductor, must have +q, but wait, that would make the total charge of the conductor +q
