Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I don't think that method is directly relevant here. The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and asks about the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically Planet3 compared to Planet1.

So, the given data:

- Equilibrium temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4.
- Equilibrium temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3.
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15.
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35.
- Albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth.

We need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by a formula involving the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the formula is T_p = [(L (1 - a))/(16 π D² σ)]^(1/4), where L is star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But since all three planets orbit the same star, L and σ are the same for all. The albedo a is the same (0.3), so the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the distance. Wait, because T is proportional to (L (1 - a))^(1/4) / D^(1/2). So T ∝ D^(-1/2). Alternatively, T^4 ∝ (1/(D^2)).

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula:

T_eq = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π D² σ) ]^(1/4 )

So T ∝ sqrt( (L (1 - a) ) ) / D^(1/2) )

Wait, no. Let me rearrange it: T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / (D)^(1/2), since (L)^(1/4) and (D^-2)^(1/4)=D^-0.5.

So T ∝ L^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Since L is the same for all planets, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D). So if two planets have a ratio of temperatures, then the ratio of their distances is (T2/T1)^2. Wait,
