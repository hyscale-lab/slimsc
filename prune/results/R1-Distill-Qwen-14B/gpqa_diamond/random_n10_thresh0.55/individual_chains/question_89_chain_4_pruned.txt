Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is a polycyclic structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead positions. 

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibrominated compounds are treated with bases, especially under high temperatures, elimination reactions often occur. Since it's dibromide, I think this would lead to a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So, each Br would be removed, and a double bond would form where they were.

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination, would form a diene? Or maybe an adjacent diene? No, wait, elimination of two bromines from adjacent carbons would form a double bond. But in adamantane, the structure is such that the bridgehead positions are adjacent. So, when KOH is used, two HBr molecules are eliminated, and a double bond forms between the two bridgehead carbons. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,3-diene structure within the adamantane framework. Also, the product is a light yellow solid. Wait, but alkenes are usually colorless, but maybe if it's a strained diene, it could have some color? Or perhaps the product is an epoxide, but no, KOH wouldn't make that. Wait, or is it an elimination to form a bridgehead double bond?

But wait, the product's 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet or split into a multiplet, but 4.8 is usually around where vinyl protons are, but more deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol or ether. But wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl stretch, so maybe a ketone or ester or something. Hmm, that's confusing me because if KOH is used, maybe it's a condensation reaction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. When a dibromide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it
