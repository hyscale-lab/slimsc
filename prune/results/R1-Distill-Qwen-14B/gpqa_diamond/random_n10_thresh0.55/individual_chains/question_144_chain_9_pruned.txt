Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm not too familiar with the specifics, so I'll have to think through this.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving a different distance in meters.

I think the mean decay distance depends on how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel. Oh wait, right! The mean lifetime (τ) is related to the width Γ. I remember that in particle physics, the natural linewidth or resonance width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime: Γ = ħ/τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (Γ, which is the width) and the time uncertainty (τ, the lifetime) is on the order of ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. That makes τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's right.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay distance by multiplying the lifetime by the velocity of the particle. Because distance is velocity multiplied by time. So, mean decay distance L = v * τ.

But wait, what's the velocity here? The particle is moving at relativ
