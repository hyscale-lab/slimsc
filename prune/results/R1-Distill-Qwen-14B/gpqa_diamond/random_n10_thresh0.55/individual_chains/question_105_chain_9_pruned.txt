Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere and how that affects the light curve, and how it compares to an exoplanet's effect. Hmm.

Alright, the star is similar to the Sun in radius. So Rstar is same as Sun's radius. The star has a Teff of 6000K. The spots are covering 20% of one hemisphere. The temperature difference between the spots and the rest is 1000K. So the spots are cooler, I guess, since they're dark. So the spot temperature is Teff - 1000K, which is 5000K.

The question is about the photometric variations. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the brightness change due to the spots is similar to what we see with a planet transiting the star. But the setup is a bit different because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots that are on that hemisphere will rotate into and out of our view. So the brightness dip would be periodic as the spots rotate in and out of the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but the question states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the brightness variation caused by the spots is being mistaken for a planet transit. But the question is, if instead of spots, there's a planet, what would be the radius to cause the same amplitude in brightness variation.

So the task is to compute the planet radius Rpl relative to the star's radius Rstar. So Rpl/Rstar.

I remember that the change in brightness (delta F) when a planet transits a star is approximately equal to the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star. Since both are circular, the area is proportional to radius squared. So delta F â‰ˆ (Rpl / Rstar)^2.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a change in brightness. So when the spots are on the visible side, the brightness is lower because the spots are cooler and emit less light. The problem is to find the planet radius that would cause the same brightness change as the spots.

Wait, but how is the spot-induced brightness change calculated? The spots are covering 20% of one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is
