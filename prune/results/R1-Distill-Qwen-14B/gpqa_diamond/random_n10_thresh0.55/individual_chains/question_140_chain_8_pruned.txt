Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what I can make of it.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts with a liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is around 277 K. Oh, and there's another clue about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is a reagent used in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I should identify what substance X might be. Since it's a reagent in organic chemistry, some common ones are NaOH, KOH, maybe something like H2SO4, but wait, that's more of an acid. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's something like THF, but that's a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like LiAlH4 or another reducing agent. Or maybe it's a metal like Mg or Na? Wait, but heavier isotopes... Oh, wait, if X incorporates a heavier isotope, maybe it's something like D2O, but that's more of a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal with a heavy isotope, like deuterium, but I'm not sure yet.

Let's think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has equal number of protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, if W has n protons and n neutrons, the total mass number would be 2n. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2 has 1 proton each, 0 neutrons each. So that doesn't fit because protons and neutrons are equal. Wait, what about NH3? No, that's a liquid. Alternatively, CO2 is a gas, but let's see. Another possibility: heavy water's reaction? Hmm.

Wait, gas W: same number of protons and neutrons. So possible options are CH4? No, because in CH4, each carbon has 6 protons and maybe 6 neutrons? Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Wait, the molecule itself has total protons equal to total neutrons. So
