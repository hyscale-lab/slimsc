Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass are being observed. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each, and the spectral line shifts are given: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for #2. I need to find how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the key here is the Doppler shift. The shift in wavelength (the periodic shift) depends on the star's velocity due to the planet's influence. The formula for Doppler shift is probably involved here, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is delta lambda over lambda equals V over c, where V is the velocity of the star and c is the speed of light. But wait, this is a periodic shift, so it's the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. The RV method gives K for each planet. If the star's velocity is higher, that implies a more massive planet (or other factors like orbital period, distance, etc.), but wait, the planet masses are similar here (both like Neptune), and the star masses are the same (like Sun), so the difference in K must be due to other factors. 

Wait, but K depends on several factors. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) ) * ( (P/(1 day)) )^(-1/3) ) ... Hmm, maybe I should think of it another way. Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( sin i ) ] / ( (P * (2
