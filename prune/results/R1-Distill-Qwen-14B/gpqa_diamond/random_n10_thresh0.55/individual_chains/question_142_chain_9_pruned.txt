Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix, right?

So first, I should probably write out what this ρ looks like. Let's see, |0⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ is [0, 1]^T. So |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them together would give a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal.

Wait, no, wait. If each term is (|0⟩⟨0|) and (|1⟩⟨1|), adding them gives a matrix like:

[1 0]
[0 1]

Then ρ is (1/2) of that, so each diagonal element is 1/2. So,

ρ = [[1/2, 0],
     [0, 1/2]]

Is that right? Yeah, because when you take the outer product of |0⟩ with ⟨0|, you get a diagonal matrix with 1 in (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Same for |1⟩⟨1|, but in (2,2). Adding them together gives a 2x2 identity matrix, then multiplied by 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh wait, I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But density matrices are more general—so perhaps they can be represented as points in a higher-dimensional space or something.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? The density matrices for pure states are projectors like |ψ⟩⟨ψ| and lie on the surface of the Bloch sphere. For mixed states, the density matrix is a statistical mixture, so the state is inside the Bloch sphere.

But how is the density matrix represented geometrically? Oh, I think the density matrix
