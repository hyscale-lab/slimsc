Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one matches the given data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Let me start by looking at each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A very broad one could be from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, often around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. So a broad peak here might suggest an alcohol or maybe a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't typically have O-H. Oh, wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are important too.

The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is often a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl group, maybe conjugated or something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a carbonyl group adjacent to something else, but I'm not sure. 

So if there's a carbonyl group, that suggests the compound has an oxygen in a double bond. Now, the other IR peak at 3000 is broader, implying possibly an O-H group. So if the compound has both a carbonyl and an O-H, maybe it's something like a ketone with an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 and a broad O-H. That might fit. Alternatively, maybe an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1700-1750, but that's more around 1700, so maybe.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR: several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones on a double bond, like
