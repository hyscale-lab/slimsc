Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, Hunsdiecker is with halides and silver salts. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Oh, wait, red phosphorus in HI—oh right! That's the reaction for the substitution of a hydroxyl group. Specifically, when an alcohol reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it's a method to convert the alcohol to an iodide. Oh wait, wait, wait, no—red phosphorus and HI is actually used to convert alcohols to iodides. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, an alcohol (ROH) would first form RPH which then reacts further to form RI. Or maybe it's a more direct substitution?

So, the reaction is probably an alcohol being converted into an alkyl iodide. So the first step is to figure out what Compound X is, and then what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

The data given are IR and NMR. Let's look at the IR first.

IR peaks: 
- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad region is usually indicative of O-H stretching. So maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid? But the presence of a broad peak in that range might suggest an -OH group.
- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong carbonyl peak. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But 1720 is a bit high for a ketone, which is usually around 1700. Wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. The carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes it can be higher depending on the substituents. Alternatively, an ester or an aldehyde? Hmm.
- 1610 and 1450 cm-1: These are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So there's probably an aromatic ring in the compound.

Now the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet
