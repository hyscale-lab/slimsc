Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of this.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, so I think that means |alpha> is actually equal to some normalization constant times that sum. First thing's first—normalizing the state because probabilities must add up to one.

So, the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To normalize, I need to find the norm of this vector. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component.

Calculating each component's magnitude:
- For (1+i), the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).
- For (2 - i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5).

So the norm squared is (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 = 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, the problem involves the operator with matrix elements Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does this operator look like in matrix form?

Since it's a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with up and down states), the diagonal elements are zero (because i=j), and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So matrix form:

A = [ [ 0, hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, 0 ] ]

Wait, that's a spin operator, probably the Pauli X operator scaled by something. The standard Pauli X matrix has 1s off the diagonal, but here it's hbar/2 times that. So A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of Pauli X, because it's just a scalar multiple. The eigenvalues of Pauli X are ±1. So for A, they would be ± hbar/2.

But wait, the question says to find the probability of
