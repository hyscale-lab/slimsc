Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then predicting the product after a series of reactions.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea about the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could mean, for example, a benzene ring (3), a double bond, and a ring or another double bond. Or maybe a benzene and a ketone or something else.

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a strong signal. A triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. High ppm like 9.7 makes me think of an aldehyde proton, which usually is around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it's an acidic proton like an aromatic OH, but that's usually broader. So maybe an aldehyde.
- 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H): These are likely aromatic protons. The downfield shift suggests maybe para-substituted phenyl groups. Like two doublets in a para-substituted ring. So maybe two aromatic rings attached to something else.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. Maybe an enol proton or something with exchange, like an -OH group. Could be an enol or a phenolic OH. But it's broad and a singlet, so maybe not adjacent to any other protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. Wait, the 'bs' stands for broad singlet.
- 3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet, probably a CH2 group attached to something deshielded, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Putting this together. Let's think about possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see what that could be. Maybe a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Looking at the options, the answers are all aldehydes with diphenyl groups or similar.

The reactions given are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

Wait, NaNO2 and HCl are usually used for diazotization, especially with aromatic amines. But the initial compound has an N in the formula, so maybe a nitro group? Or an amine?

Wait, the initial compound's NMR doesn't show any NH signals, but the molecular formula has one N. Let me think: the formula is C8H9NO. So possible functional groups: maybe a nitro group (NO2, but that would take two O's), but the formula only has one O here
