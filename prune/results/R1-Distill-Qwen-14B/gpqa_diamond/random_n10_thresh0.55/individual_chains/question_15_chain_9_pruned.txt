Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability that this happens depends on the size of the planet and the star compared to their orbital distances.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star because it has a shorter period, right? Or does it depend on the mass of the star as well? Because Kepler's third law says that the period relates to the semi-major axis cubed over the star's mass. But since both have the same mass, maybe Planet_1's period being shorter implies a smaller semi-major axis.

The host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but they have equal radii. The host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. So, Star_1 (Planet_1's star) has mass M1 = 2 * M2 (Star_2's mass). But same radius, R1 = R2.

Now, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, but also the orbital distance. The formula I recall is something like the probability is proportional to the square of the planet's radius divided by the square of the star's radius, multiplied by some geometric factor.

Wait, the exact formula for transit probability is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2? Or is it just (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something else)?

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is roughly proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. Because the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size (so R_p/R_s squared) and the ratio of the star's size to the orbital distance (so (R_s/a)^2). Alternatively, another way to think is it's the area of the planet relative to the star, and the chance it passes in front. So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something about the orbital distance). Oh, right, the probability is also proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Because the orbital distance 'a' is much larger than R_s, so the area that the planet can transit is a circle with radius a, and the area of the star is π R_s². So the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, no, I think it's actually (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2. Because the formula for the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. Let me think again. The transit probability comes from the chance that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the area of
