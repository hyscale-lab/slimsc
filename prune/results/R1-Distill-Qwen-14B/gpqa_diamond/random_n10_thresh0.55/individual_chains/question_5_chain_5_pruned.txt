Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it's got components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. My task is to find the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that for spin-½ particles, like electrons or muons, the spin operator S is proportional to the Pauli matrices. And the eigenstates of S·n (where n is the direction) are the spin-up and spin-down states along that direction. The operator here is P, which I assume is analogous to spin, maybe the spin angular momentum operator.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. So for each component, P_x, P_y, P_z, we have their matrix representations. Let me write down each matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Oh right, these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component of P is (ħ/2) times sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z respectively.

The operator in the direction n is P · n. Since n lies in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by an angle theta from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or wait, wait, in spherical coordinates, the unit vector in the x-z plane would have phi = 0, so n = (sinθ cos0, cosθ) but wait, no, wait. The unit vector components would be (sinθ * cos phi, sinθ * sin phi, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, phi is 0, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the direction is along (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P·n would be (sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z) because the y-component of n is zero. 

So let me compute that. First, let's write each term:

sinθ * P_x = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]
cosθ * P_z = cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding these together:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Because the (1,1) element is cosθ, (1,2) is sinθ, (2,1) is sinθ, (2,2) is -cosθ, all multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P
