Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to spin matrices. For electrons, the spin is 1/2, so the matrices are 2x2. Since a muon is also a spin-1/2 particle, I think the same applies here.

The problem states that the operator A_y is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). So, A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. The matrix S is given as:

First row: 0  -i
Second row: i  0

Wait, that looks familiar. I think the standard Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Oh wait, S here might be related to the Pauli matrices. Let me check: the Pauli Y matrix is usually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches exactly the S matrix given. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

So, A_y is c multiplied by sigma_y. And since c is h/(4π), that would make A_y = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. But wait, since A_y is expressed in terms of sigma_y, which is a Pauli matrix, I remember that the eigenvalues of sigma matrices are ±1. Because for any Pauli matrix σ, the eigenvalues are ±1.

So, sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Then, when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues of A_y would be c*(+1) and c*(-1). Let's compute that: c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1) → ± h/(4π).

Wait, but the options have different possibilities. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but eigenvalues of A_y are real, right? Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So A_y is (h/(4π)) times a Hermit
