Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars based on their properties. Alright, I remember that luminosity is related to a star's radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that Luminosity (L) is proportional to radius squared times temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but how does mass relate here? Oh, maybe if they're main-sequence stars, their masses relate to their luminosities. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's displacement law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1_max = λ2_max implies T1 = T2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same
