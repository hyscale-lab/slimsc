Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given a certain relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

Hmm, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Oh wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Right, because in astronomy, parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula for distance is d = 1/plx (in parsecs if plx is in arcseconds).

So, the first thing I need to do is understand the relationship between parallax and distance. Since plx = 1/d, that means as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if I have N proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/d would give me N proportional to (d)^5. Wait, because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. Oh, so they're asking about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r. Or maybe it's the differential, like dN/dr, the number per unit distance. Let me think.

If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars up to distance d is N = k*d^5, where k is some constant. But the problem is about the change with distance, so perhaps they're asking for the number of stars in a small range, say from r to r+dr. That would be the derivative of N with respect to r, right? Because that gives you the rate of change of the number with distance.

So if N = k r^5, then dN/dr is 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) would go as r^4. So the number increases with r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, let me think again. The initial statement says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C * (1/plx)^5, where C is a constant. Since plx is 1/d, substitute that in: N = C * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But that's the cumulative number up to distance d. The number of stars in a shell between d and d + dd is the derivative, which is 5C d^4. So per unit distance, it's 5C d^4, so proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer is C, which is r^4.

Another way: maybe they're considering the number of stars in a given volume, but wait, the question is about a specific region of the sky. So it's a thin shell, not a volume. Or perhaps it's a surface density scenario.

Wait, wait, no. The number of stars in a region of the sky (so it's a surface, not a volume). But distance affects how many stars are in that region. For example, in the Milky Way, the number of stars in a given direction might depend on the density of stars along the line of sight, which depends on distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number density of stars as a function of distance. But how? Let me get back.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, then N is proportional to d^5. So for each additional distance unit, how does the number change? If N grows as d^5, then the change in N with d would be dN/dd = 5 d^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

So the correct option is C, which is ~ r^4.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we can substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) into the relationship. This gives \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the cumulative number of stars up to a distance \( d \) increases as \( d^5 \).

To find the number of stars per unit distance (or the rate of change of the number of stars with distance), we take the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \): 

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). This corresponds to option C, which states \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
