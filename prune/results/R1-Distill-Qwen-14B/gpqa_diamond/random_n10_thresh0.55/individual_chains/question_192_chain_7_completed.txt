Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So imagine the conductor is a big sphere, and the cavity is a smaller sphere somewhere inside, not exactly at the center because s isn't zero. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R, so the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each giving different expressions for E.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. In electrostatics, charges reside on the surface of a conductor. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. But there's a charge inside the cavity. How does that affect the conductor?

I think this is related to the concept of electrostatic shielding. If a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor itself remains neutral, but charges redistribute on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, no, if the conductor is uncharged, then the inner surface must have an induced charge opposite to the charge inside the cavity, and the outer surface must have zero net charge. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral.

Wait, let's think. The conductor is initially uncharged. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have an induced charge -q. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance? No, wait, no. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Conductors in electrostatic equilibrium have the property that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the charges rearrange themselves. The charge inside the cavity, +q, induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor's cavity. Since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense.

So, the outer surface of the conductor has a charge +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the distance from the center of the conductor to P is L, which is larger than R. We need to find the electric field at P due to the charges present.

Wait, so the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. Since the conductor is a spherical shell (well, almost, but with a cavity), the charge on the outer surface would distribute uniformly because it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. So, the electric field outside the conductor due to its charge would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/r², where Q is the charge outside the Gaussian surface.

In this case, the Gaussian surface at P encloses the entire conductor. The charge enclosed by that surface is the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the electric field at P should be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because L is the radius of the Gaussian surface.

Wait, but let me think again. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The conductor's radius is R, so L is greater than R, so it's outside. The charge on the conductor's outer surface is +q, so the field at P is due to that charge only, because the inner charges (cavity and inner surface) are screened.

So the field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²).

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything else. The charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is offset by distance s from the center. Does this affect the electric field at point P?

Wait, because the conductor is a sphere, the external field depends only on the total charge outside the Gaussian surface. The position of the charge inside the cavity (the s and theta and l) might influence the inner surface, but once we're outside, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface, which is the outer charge.

Wait, but wait a minute. The conductor's outer charge is uniformly distributed, so the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance, regardless of where the inner charge is placed. So the presence of the inner cavity's charge and its position shouldn't affect the external field, as long as the conductor is a perfect sphere. Because any asymmetry in the inner charge would cause the conductor to have a dipole or other multipole moments, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere, so all multipole moments beyond monopole (which is the total charge) would be zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's shape is a sphere, yes. The inner cavity isn't a sphere—wait, no, the cavity is spherical as well. The conductor is a sphere with a spherical cavity. So the setup is symmetric. The charge inside the cavity is a point charge, but because the cavity is offset by s, the inner surface's charge distribution would not be uniform. But the conductor's outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor itself.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so regardless of where the inner charge is placed, the outer surface's charge will distribute uniformly. Because the conductor is a sphere in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the outer surface will adjust to make the field inside the conductor zero.

But wait, the inner charge is +q, so the inner cavity's walls have -q. The conductor is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. So the outer surface has a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is spherical. Therefore, at a point outside, the electric field at P would be the same as that due to a point charge q at the center.

So, the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So answer option B.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option B is exactly that. So that's the correct choice.

But why are other options there? Let me look:

Option A: (l - s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. That would be if the point were inside the conductor or something else.

Option C: (l + s cosθ)^2, similar but with plus.

Option D: 1/l². That would be if the field was due to the charge at the center of the cavity, but that's not the case because the charge is inside the conductor, so outside the conductor, the field is due to the conductor's outer charge, not the cavity's charge.

So I think the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and its radius is $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conductor Properties**: Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the field inside the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor, being neutral overall, must then have a charge of $+q$ to balance the $-q$ on the inner surface.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly in electrostatic equilibrium. The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface and the distance from the center. At point $P$, which is outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.

3. **Field Expression**: Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to $P$. The position of the charge inside the cavity (parameters $s$, $\theta$, and $l$) does not affect the external field because the conductor's outer surface charge ensures spherical symmetry.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is incorrect because the external field depends only on the total charge and the distance $L$.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, making it correct.
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Suggests the field depends on $l^2$, which would be true if the field were due to the charge inside the cavity. However, the external field is due to the conductor's outer surface charge, not the cavity's charge.

### Conclusion:
The correct electric field at point $P$ is given by Option B.

**Answer: B**
