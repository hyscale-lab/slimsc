Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states: In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Hmm. Wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. And they're asking about how N changes with distance r. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (in parsecs), right? So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Oh wait, no, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by r (distance in parsecs). So plx = 1/r.

Wait, the question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/r. So 1/plx is equal to r. So N ∝ (r)^5. Wait, that would make N proportional to r^5. But wait, that's if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is (1/(1/r))^5) → (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5?

But wait, that doesn't
