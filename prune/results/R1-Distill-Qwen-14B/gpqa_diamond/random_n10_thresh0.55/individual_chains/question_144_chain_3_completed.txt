Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. The given data are the production energy (8 GeV), mass (1.2 GeV), and width (320 MeV). The options are four different distances in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula, I think, is something like c multiplied by the lifetime, where c is the speed of light. But wait, particles don't live forever, so their lifetime is related to their decay width.

The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE, so Γ ≈ ħ/τ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, I should check the exact relation. Oh right, the width Γ is the total decay rate, and the lifetime τ is given by τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). So τ is inversely proportional to Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Because the mean decay distance is c * τ * β, where β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c). Because the particles are moving relativistically, I can't just assume they're moving at the speed of light. So I need to calculate their velocity.

But how to find the velocity? I remember that for a particle, the energy is related to its rest mass and momentum. The energy E is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can rearrange this to find pc. From that, I can get p = sqrt(E² - m²c^4)/(c). Then, the momentum p is also equal to gamma * m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Alternatively, since gamma is E/(m c²), because E = gamma m c².

Wait, maybe it's easier to find the velocity using the relation β = v/c. And I know that gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - β²). Also, since E = gamma m c², gamma is E/(m c²). So let me compute gamma first.

Given E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Wait, because the GeV units cancel since E is in GeV and m c² is in GeV (since m is in GeV/c² and c² is in (m/s)^2, but when multiplied by GeV/c², the units would be GeV), but I'm probably overcomplicating the units here. So gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666..., which is 20/3 or 6 and 2/3.

So gamma is about 6.6667. Then, I can find beta. Let's write the equation for gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)

So, 1/gamma² = 1 - beta²

beta² = 1 - 1/gamma²

Plugging in gamma = 20/3, so gamma squared is (400)/(9). So 1/gamma² is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775

Taking the square root, beta ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.9775). Let's see, 0.988 squared is about 0.976 because 0.988^2 = (1 - 0.012)^2 = approx 1 - 0.024 + 0.000144 = 0.976144. Hmm, but 0.988^2 is 0.976, which is a bit less than 0.9775. So perhaps let me compute it more accurately.

0.988^2 = 0.976144, as above. 0.9885^2 = let's compute 9885 * 9885. Wait, maybe using a calculator approach: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, where a=0.988, b=0.0005.

So, (0.988 + 0.0005)^2 = 0.988² + 2*(0.988)*(0.0005) + (0.0005)^2 = 0.976144 + 0.000988 + 0.00000025 = 0.97713225. Hmm, but our target is 0.9775. So I need a beta a bit higher than 0.9885.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). Let's compute it numerically.

gamma = 20/3 ≈6.666667.

1/gamma^2 = 1/(400/9) = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta^2 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate it more accurately. Let me think: 0.9887^2 = ?

Well, 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let me compute:

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Break it down as (1 - 0.0113)^2) = 1 - 2*0.0113 + (0.0113)^2) = 1 - 0.0226 + 0.00012769 = 0.97752769.

Which is about 0.97753, which is very close to our target 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Alternatively, using a calculator function, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887. So the velocity is about 0.9887c.

Now, back to the decay distance. The mean decay length is c * tau * beta.

Wait, but tau is the lifetime, which is tau = hbar/(Gamma). Because tau is the mean lifetime, and the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the inverse of the lifetime via Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me double-check units. The decay width Γ has units of energy. Because in natural units (where ħ = c =1), lifetime has units of inverse energy. So, when we have Γ in GeV, tau will be in inverse GeV multiplied by ħ/(c^5) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in SI units.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute tau (lifetime) = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh wait, the units of Γ are in MeV. So I need to convert everything to consistent units.

But let's think about the formula. The lifetime tau is given by tau = ħ / Γ. But the units must be correct.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. Γ is in MeV. So I need to convert Γ into J to make the units match.

So first, convert Γ from MeV to Joules.

1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 1.60218e-13 J.

Therefore, Γ = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320 * 1e6 * 1.60218e-19 J.

Wait, wait, no: 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 320 MeV is 320 * 1e6 eV. So converting to J:

Gamma = 320e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J.

Let me compute that:

320e6 = 3.2e8.

3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = (3.2 * 1.60218) * 1e-11.

3.2 * 1.60218 ≈ 5.12698.

So Gamma ≈ 5.12698e-11 J.

Now, ħ is Planck's constant over 2 pi, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So tau = ħ / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.12698e-11 J) ≈ (1.05457e-34)/(5.12698e-11) s.

Let's compute that division: 1.05457e-34 / 5.12698e-11 ≈ (1.05457 / 5.12698) )e-23.

1.05457 /5.12698 ≈ 0.2056.

So tau ≈ 0.2056e-23 s = 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really small. Did I make a mistake? Because 320 MeV is a pretty high decay width, which implies a short lifetime.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. Gamma is 320 MeV = 320e6 eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 320 * 1e6 * 1.602e-19.

320 * 1e6 is 3.2e8. 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = 3.2 *1.602=5.1264; 5.1264e-11 J.

Yes, that's correct. So Gamma is 5.1264e-11 J.

Tau is ħ / Gamma = 1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11.

Which is approximately (1.05457e-34) / (5.1264e-11) = (1.05457 /5.1264) ) * 1e-23.

1.05457 /5.1264 ≈ 0.2056. So 0.2056e-23 = 2.056e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's the lifetime. Now, the decay distance is c * tau * beta.

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, distance L = c * tau * beta.

So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056e-24 s) * 0.9887.

Let me compute that.

First, multiply 3e8 and 2.056e-24:

3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16 m.

Then multiply by beta (≈0.9887):

6.168e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.168 *0.9887 ≈ 6.104e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option exactly matching that. The options are A)5.0223e-16 m, B)4.065e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.065e-16.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 6.1e-16 m, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me recheck.

Alternative approach: Let's calculate in natural units where ħ = c = 1, and then convert to meters.

In natural units, the width Γ is in GeV, lifetime tau is in GeV^-1.

But we have to convert from GeV^-1 to seconds, then multiply by speed of light (in m/s) and beta to get meters.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to calculate the decay length using the formula:

L = c * tau * beta.

But tau = ħ/(Gamma) → let's compute this using natural units.

Wait, in natural units (ħ = c = 1), 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 6.582e-25 seconds (since ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s). So, tau (in seconds) is (6.582e-25 s·GeV) * (1 GeV / Gamma_in_GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 * (1 / Gamma_in_GeV) ) s.

Wait, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So,

tau = 6.582e-25 s·GeV / 0.32 GeV = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056e-24 s, which matches what I calculated earlier.

So that's correct.

Now, L = c * tau * beta.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So,

L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s * 0.9887.

Multiply 3e8 and 2.056e-24:

3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16 m.

Then multiply by beta (0.9887):

6.168e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 6.1e-16 m.

But none of the options are around 6e-16. The options are A) ~5e-16, D) ~4e-16.

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculating beta?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for beta.

Gamma is 8 GeV production energy, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So yes, gamma is 20/3.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So gamma^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

1/gamma^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is in the calculation of gamma?

Wait, another thought: the production energy E is given as 8 GeV. Is E the total energy or the kinetic energy?

Wait, the problem says E_X =8 GeV. That probably refers to the total energy, because in particle physics, when they give E for a particle, it's usually the total energy, not the kinetic. So E = gamma m c², so that's correct.

So that part seems right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the decay width is given in MeV but the energy and mass are in GeV. So Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, right? Yes.

But let's re-calculate L with more precise numbers, just in case.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

Let me compute ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Gamma = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 5.126976e-11 J.

Tau = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = let's compute this:

1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = (1.0545718 /5.126976 ) * 1e-23.

Calculating 1.0545718 /5.126976:

Approximately 0.2056.

So tau = 0.2056e-23 s = 2.056e-24 s.

Yes, same as before.

So, L = c * tau * beta = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056e-24 s) * 0.9887.

Let me compute each part:

3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16 m.

Multiply by beta (0.9887):

6.168e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.106e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the decay distance formula is different when considering resonance production. Or maybe the energy used isn't the same as the center-of-mass energy? Maybe I should compute the velocity using the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the velocity using the relativistic equations correctly.

Wait, E is the total energy, E = gamma m c².

Momentum p = gamma m v.

Wait, but E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So,

E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So,

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

So,

p = sqrt( (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but the units are in GeV, so perhaps it's better to compute in units where c=1 for simplicity.

So,

p = sqrt(8² -1.2²) GeV = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV/c.

Then, p = gamma m v.

Because p = gamma m v, and since gamma = E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.6667.

So,

p = gamma m v.

But gamma m = E/(c²) because E = gamma m c² → gamma m = E/(c²).

Wait, perhaps let me write v in terms of p and gamma.

p = gamma m v.

But gamma m = E/(c²).

So,

p = (E/(c²)) * v.

So,

v = (p c²) / E.

Wait, that makes sense.

So,

v = (p c²) / E.

p is 7.91 GeV/c.

So,

p c² = 7.91 GeV * (c^2) / c = 7.91 GeV c.

Wait, but E is 8 GeV.

So,

v = (7.91 GeV c ) / (8 GeV) ) = (7.91/8) c ≈0.98875 c.

Which is the same as before, so beta is 0.98875.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, so the initial calculation of L is about 6.1e-16 m. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options:

A)5.0223 * 10^-16

B)4.0655 *10^-15

C)5.0223 * 10^-15

D)4.0655 *10^-16

So the closest would be option A (5.0223e-16) or D (4.0655e-16).

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing L. Let me recheck the calculation.

L = c * tau * beta.

c = 3e8 m/s.

Tau = 2.056e-24 s.

So,

3e8 m/s * 2.056e-24 s = 6.168e-16 m.

Multiply by beta (0.9887):

6.168e-16 *0.9887 ≈ 6.106e-16 m.

But this is about 6.1e-16 m, which is not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the decay width is given as Gamma = 320 MeV, which is the total width. But sometimes, the total width is related to the lifetime via tau = ħ/(Gamma). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the mean lifetime as tau = ħ/(Gamma) multiplied by the speed of light.

Wait, no, the decay length is L = c * beta * gamma * (hbar / (Gamma c)). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternative approach: perhaps using the formula for the decay length for a relativistic particle.

The formula I remember is L = c * beta * gamma * (hbar c / Gamma).

Wait, let me think. Gamma is the width, and in natural units, c=1, ħ=1.

Wait, perhaps the formula is L ≈ c * beta * gamma * (ħ c) / Gamma.

Because in natural units, L = beta * gamma * (ħ c) / Gamma.

But perhaps I should write it properly.

The mean lifetime is tau = ħ/(Gamma).

The velocity is beta c.

The distance is L = beta c * tau = beta c * (ħ / Gamma).

So,

L = (beta c ) * ( ħ / Gamma )

But ħ c is a constant. Let's compute ħ c.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So ħ c = 1.0545718e-34 * 3e8 = 3.1637e-26 J·m.

But J is kg·m²/s². So, J·m is kg·m³/s².

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps to compute L in meters, it's better to use the expression:

L = (beta * c * ħ ) / Gamma.

But wait, let's think in terms of units.

Gamma has units of energy (MeV), so to make units of meters, I need to have ( ħ c ) in units of energy * length.

Because ħ has units of J·s, c in m/s. So, ħ c is J·m.

Since 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s², so J·m is kg·m^3/s².

But that's not directly helpful.

Wait, maybe instead, I should use the fact that ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm.

Wait! Oh, that's a useful fact. 1 fm is 1e-15 m.

So,

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So, using this, I can write L as:

L = (beta * (ħ c) ) / (Gamma) ) * (1 / c) )

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think in terms of natural units.

In natural units, ħ = c =1.

In that case, the formula for L is:

L = (beta * gamma) * ( ħ c ) / (Gamma)

Wait, but in natural units, ħ c is in units of energy * length.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the expression in terms of known constants.

The decay length is L = c * beta * tau.

But tau is ħ/(Gamma).

So,

L = c * beta * ( ħ / Gamma )

Which can be written as (beta * ħ c ) / Gamma.

So,

L = ( beta * ħ c ) / Gamma.

Now, substituting the known values.

Beta is 0.9887.

Gamma is 320 MeV.

So, let's compute beta * ħ c.

In units where ħ c is in MeV·fm.

As I said earlier, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

beta * ħ c ≈ 0.9887 * 197.33 MeV·fm ≈ 195.07 MeV·fm.

Now, L = (195.07 MeV·fm ) / (320 MeV ) ) = (195.07 / 320 ) fm.

Compute 195.07 /320 ≈ 0.6096 fm.

Which is 0.6096e-15 m.

Wait, that's 6.096e-16 m.

But that's close to option A (5.02e-16) and D (4.06e-16). Wait, 6.096e-16 is not exactly any of the options. Hmm. So maybe I'm still missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption of the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

Another resource says that the mean path is L = (c * tau) * beta.

Which is what I've been using.

But perhaps the correct formula is L = (c * tau) * beta * gamma.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the lifetime is tau = ħ/(Gamma).

Wait, but for a particle moving at speed beta c, the time it takes to travel a distance L is L/(beta c). So, the number of lifetimes it lives is (L/(beta c)) / tau.

But the mean decay length is when the number of lifetimes is 1.

So,

L = beta c * tau.

Which is the same as before.

So,

L = beta c * tau.

But tau is ħ/(Gamma).

So,

L = beta c * ( ħ / Gamma )

Which can be written as (beta ħ c ) / Gamma.

Which is what we have.

So,

beta ħ c = 0.9887 * (197.33 MeV·fm) ≈ 195.07 MeV·fm.

Divided by Gamma =320 MeV.

So,

L = (195.07 /320 ) fm ≈ 0.6096 fm = 0.6096e-15 m =6.096e-16 m.

But wait, none of the options match this. The closest is option A, which is 5.02e-16, but that's about 17% less than my calculation.

Hmm. What if I made a mistake in the calculation of beta?

Wait, earlier I had beta^2 = 0.9775, sqrt of that is about 0.9887, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely.

Let me calculate 0.9887^2: 0.9887 * 0.9887.

Compute 0.988 * 0.988: 0.976144.

The exact calculation:

0.9887

*0.9887

= ?

Let me compute it:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2

= 0.98² + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2

= 0.9604 + 0.017148 + 0.00007569

= 0.9604 + 0.017148 = 0.977548 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97762369.

But our target is 0.9775. So beta is slightly less than 0.9887. Let's compute.

Wait, because 0.9887^2 is 0.9776, which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So perhaps beta is a bit less than 0.9887.

Wait, compute 0.9885^2:

0.9885 * 0.9885.

Compute as (0.98 + 0.0085)^2.

= 0.98² + 2*(0.98)(0.0085) + (0.0085)^2.

=0.9604 + 2*(0.98 * 0.0085) + 0.00007225.

0.98 * 0.0085 = 0.00833.

So 2 * 0.00833 = 0.01666.

So,

0.9604 + 0.01666 = 0.97706 + 0.00007225 = 0.97713225.

Which is 0.97713225, less than 0.9775.

So, 0.9885^2 = 0.97713225.

We need to find x where x^2 = 0.9775.

x is between 0.9885 and 0.9887.

Let me use linear approximation.

At x=0.9885, x²=0.97713225.

At x=0.9886, x²= (0.9885 +0.0001)^2 = 0.97713225 + 2*(0.9885)(0.0001) + (0.0001)^2 = 0.97713225 + 0.0001977 + 0.00000001 ≈0.97732996.

Still less than 0.9775.

At x=0.9887, x²=0.97762369.

So, to reach 0.9775.

The difference between 0.9885 and 0.9887 is 0.0002 in x, which increased x² by about 0.97762369 - 0.97713225 = 0.00049144.

We need to find delta x where:

x² = 0.97713225 + delta_x² = 0.9775.

delta_x² = 0.00036775.

So, delta_x ≈ (0.00036775) / (2x) ) ≈ 0.00036775 / (2 *0.9885) ) ≈0.00036775 / 1.977 ≈0.000186.

So, x ≈0.9885 + 0.000186 ≈0.988686.

So, beta ≈0.988686.

So, beta ≈0.988686.

So, using this more precise beta, let's recalculate L.

L = (beta * ħ c ) / Gamma.

beta =0.988686.

So,

beta * ħ c = 0.988686 * 197.33 MeV·fm ≈ (197.33 * 0.988686) MeV·fm.

Compute 197.33 * 0.988686.

Approximately:

197.33 *0.98 =193.3834.

197.33 *0.008686 = approx 1.713.

So total ≈193.3834 +1.713 =195.096.

So, beta * ħ c ≈ 195.096 MeV·fm.

Then, L = 195.096 /320 MeV·fm / MeV = (195.096/320 ) fm = 0.609675 fm.

Which is 6.09675e-16 meters.

Still, that's about 6.097e-16 m, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the decay width. Let me recheck the Gamma.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, in the tau calculation, I used Gamma in GeV, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the entire calculation with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps the error comes from the initial assumption that E is the total energy. What if E is the kinetic energy instead?

Wait, the problem states E_X=8 GeV. Typically, in particle physics, E refers to the total energy. But if E were the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be K + m c².

Wait, let me try that approach.

If E is the kinetic energy, then total energy E_total = m c² + K = 1.2 GeV + 8 GeV =9.2 GeV.

Then, gamma = E_total/(m c²) = 9.2 /1.2 =7.666666...

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2= (7.666666)^2 = approx 58.7778.

1/gamma^2=0.01703.

So beta^2=1-0.01703=0.98297.

beta= sqrt(0.98297)= approx 0.99145.

So, recalculating L:

L = (beta * ħ c ) / Gamma.

beta=0.99145.

beta * ħ c = 0.99145 *197.33 MeV·fm ≈195.8 MeV·fm.

Divide by Gamma=320 MeV:

L= 195.8 /320 fm ≈0.6119 fm =6.119e-16 m.

Which is about 6.12e-16 m. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently.

Alternative approach: use the relation between width and lifetime, then calculate the velocity.

Width Γ is given in MeV. To find tau, I need to use tau = ħ/(Gamma).

But perhaps I should use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1.

In natural units:

Gamma is 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV =0.32 GeV).

Tau = 1/(Gamma) = 1/(0.32 GeV) = 3.125 GeV^-1.

But to convert GeV^-1 to seconds, I use ħ =6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, tau (seconds) = 3.125 GeV^-1 * 6.582e-25 s·GeV =3.125 *6.582e-25 = approx 2.056e-24 s.

Same as before.

So that part is correct.

Now, velocity is beta c. So, beta is 0.9887 as before.

So, L = c * tau * beta.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

L=3e8 * 2.056e-24 *0.9887.

Compute that:

3e8 * 2.056e-24 = 6.168e-16.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.168e-16 *0.9887 ≈6.106e-16 m.

Hmm, same result as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, another way to compute beta.

We have E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

So, gamma=E/(m c²) =8/(1.2) =6.666666...

So,

gamma²=44.44444.

gamma squared is 44.44444.

Thus,

beta squared = 1 - (1/gamma²) = 1 - (1/44.44444) )=1 -0.0225=0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775)=0.98868...

So beta is correct.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option A is 5.02e-16 m.

Option D is4.06e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta squared.

Wait, 1/gamma² is 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) =1/( (20/3)^2 ) =9/400=0.0225.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the decay width is not in GeV but in MeV, so I shouldn't have converted it to GeV. Wait, no, because tau = ħ/(Gamma). So Gamma must be in the same units as ħ's energy unit.

But ħ is in J·s, so Gamma should be in J.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Gamma in J correctly.

Gamma is 320 MeV.

1 eV=1.602e-19 J.

So,

320e6 eV =320e6 *1.602e-19 J.

320e6 is 3.2e8.

3.2e8 *1.602e-19 =5.1264e-11 J.

Yes, same as before.

Tau=1.0545718e-34 /5.1264e-11= 2.056e-24 s.

So no mistake there.

Hmm. Unless the problem expects the velocity to be non-relativistic, but that's impossible because gamma is 6.666.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay length formula is L= c * tau * gamma beta. Because I recall that in some cases, time dilation comes into play. Let me think.

Wait, tau is the proper time. So, the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

So, the decay length L= c * (gamma tau) * beta.

Because the particle moves at beta c for a time gamma tau.

So,

L= c * gamma tau * beta.

So,

gamma tau is the dilated lifetime.

So, let me recompute L with this formula.

Tau = ħ / Gamma =2.056e-24 s.

Gamma=20/3.

So,

gamma tau = (20/3) * 2.056e-24 ≈ 13.706e-24 s.

Then,

L= c * gamma tau * beta.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

3e8 * 13.706e-24 *0.9887.

Compute step by step.

3e8 *13.706e-24 =4.1118e-15.

Multiply by 0.9887: 4.1118e-15 *0.9887≈4.066e-15 m.

Which is option B:4.0655e-15 m. But wait, option B is 4.0655e-15, which matches closely.

Wait, but I thought the formula was L = c * beta * tau. But perhaps I was wrong, and the correct formula is L= c * beta * gamma * tau.

Because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So, the time the particle lives as seen in the lab is gamma tau. So, the distance traveled is c * beta * gamma tau.

Which would be L= c * beta gamma tau.

Which is c beta gamma tau = c beta (gamma tau).

Hmm, that's a different approach.

So, let's recompute using this formula.

Gamma is 20/3, tau is 2.056e-24 s.

So,

gamma tau= (20/3) *2.056e-24 ≈13.706e-24 s.

Beta is 0.9887.

So,

L= c * beta * gamma tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

So,

3e8 m/s * 0.9887 *13.706e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 *13.706e-24 = 4.1118e-15 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 4.1118e-15 *0.9887 ≈4.066e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.066e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m. So, that's option B.

But wait, earlier I thought the formula was L= c beta tau, but perhaps the correct formula is L= c beta gamma tau.

How?

Because tau is the proper time. So, the time experienced by the particle is tau, but in the lab frame, it's longer by gamma. So, the time the particle is moving is gamma tau.

So, the distance it travels is beta c multiplied by the lab frame time, which is gamma tau.

So,

L= beta c * gamma tau = beta gamma c tau.

Which is the same as (beta gamma) * c tau.

Which is the same as c tau beta gamma.

So,

L= c tau beta gamma.

Which gives approximately 4.066e-15 m, which is option B.

But the options do include option B as 4.0655e-15 m.

So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula was L= c beta tau. But that must have been incorrect. The correct formula must include gamma.

So why did I get confused earlier? Because I was mixing proper time and lab frame time.

So, the correct formula is L= c * beta * gamma * tau.

Which gives the value matching option B.

But the initial approach didn't include gamma, which led to a different answer.

So, I think the correct approach is to use L= c * beta * gamma * tau.

So, the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the mean lifetime, and
- \( \Gamma \) is the decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The total energy \( E \) is given as \( 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and the mass \( m \) is \( 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using the formula for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
The relation between \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), and using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
Substituting into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = c \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (0.9887) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056 \times 10^{-24})
\]

First, calculate \( c \cdot \tau \):

\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.168 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Then, multiply by \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):

\[
L = 6.168 \times 10^{-16} \cdot (0.9887 \cdot 6.6667) \approx 6.168 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 6.611 \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.066 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
