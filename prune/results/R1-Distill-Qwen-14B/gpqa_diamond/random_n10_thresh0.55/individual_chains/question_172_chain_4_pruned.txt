Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Wait, what's LTE again? Oh right, it's the condition where the gas in a small region is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field. So the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Boltzmann distribution, right. The probability of a particle being in an energy state E is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So the ratio of populations in two energy states would be (n2/n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ).

In this problem, the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J, so E2 - E1 is that value. Star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms as star_2 in a specific energy level. Wait, wait. Wait, maybe I should clarify: the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or is it the other way around? Let me read again.

The iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh, wait, does that mean the number in the higher energy level? Or the excitation (like energy) is higher? Hmm, I think it's about the population. So n_1 (level 2) over n_1 (level 1) equals twice that of star_2? Or maybe the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is different between the stars.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each star's situation.

Let me think. For each star, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. Let's say E is the energy difference. So for star 1, (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -E/(k*T1) ). Similarly, for star 2: (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -E/(k*T2) ).

The problem states that for star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in the specific energy level. Wait, perhaps that means the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, but all else being equal? Or maybe the excitation is compared between the two stars.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But considering the same energy level, so we can model the ratio as (n_upper, star1)/(n_upper, star2) = 2. Or maybe the ratio of (n_upper / n_lower) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. I'm a bit confused here. Let me parse the question again.

The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for a specific energy level (same E for both), star_1 has twice the excitation. So I think that refers to the population in that energy level. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the energy, but that
