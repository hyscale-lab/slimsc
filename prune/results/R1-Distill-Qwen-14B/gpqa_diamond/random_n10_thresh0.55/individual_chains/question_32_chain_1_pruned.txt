Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about finding the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC is a particle accelerator, right? And the nucleus here is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, I think. Because Li's atomic number is 3, so 3 protons plus 3 neutrons makes mass number 6. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus.

The question is to find the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I think the energy here refers to the kinetic energy or the total energy? Well, in particle accelerators, they usually refer to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy including rest mass. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think.

Wait, in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy. And the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times the rest mass energy. So the question is about which one they're asking. The question says 'energy of the collider', which I think typically refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. But sometimes, especially in high-energy physics, when they say 'energy', they mean the total energy. Hmm, I need to be careful here.

So first, I should figure out the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. Lithium-6 has Z=3, so number of protons is
