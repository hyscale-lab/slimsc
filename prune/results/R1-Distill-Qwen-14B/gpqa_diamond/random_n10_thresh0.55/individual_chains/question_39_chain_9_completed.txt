Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability density of finding a particle at a position is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|². And since the wave function is a complex number, I'll need to compute that.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = A + B, where A is a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and B is the imaginary part (-0.5i). 

The absolute square is |ψ|² = (A)² + (B)² because the real and imaginary parts are perpendicular in the complex plane. So, |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because (0.5i) squared magnitude is (0.5)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5 i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because |a + bi|² = a² + b². So yeah, that's correct.

Since the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the probability outside this interval is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. But wait, no, the wave function itself isn't necessarily zero, because in quantum mechanics, the wave function can have a non-zero value outside the region where the particle is found. Instead, the probability of finding the particle outside is zero, so the integral of |ψ|² from x <1 and x>3 must be zero.

Wait, but the problem says that when measured, none were found outside. So the probability density must be zero outside. Hmm, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If the wave function is non-zero outside, that would imply some probability. But the problem states that in reality, no particles are found outside, so the wave function must be zero outside. But that contradicts the given expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for a part of space where the particle can exist. Oh, so maybe the wave function is zero outside that region. Or perhaps the given wave function is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the question says that the wave function is that expression in the part of space where it can exist, which is x between 1 and 3. So outside, the wave function is zero.

Wait, but that's not making sense because the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is a function of x. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, which is a function that depends on x. So how can that be zero outside? Because in this case, the wave function is expressed as a function of x, which is non-zero in all x, but the probability is zero outside. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the wave function is non-zero outside, the probability wouldn't be zero. So perhaps the given expression is only valid within the region where the particle exists, and zero elsewhere. But the problem states that the wave function is that expression in the part of space where it can exist. Oh, so the wave function is that expression between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But that presents a problem because the given expression at x=1 would be a/sqrt(2), and at x=3, a/sqrt(4)=a/2. So it doesn't naturally drop to zero at x=1 or x=3 unless a is adjusted in a certain way.

Wait, but the wave function must be continuous at the boundaries. Hmm, but if the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, then at x=1, the wave function must be zero. Let me see: at x=1, the expression is (a / sqrt(2)) - 0.5i. For this to be zero, (a/sqrt(2)) must be zero and 0.5 must be zero, which is impossible. So that approach can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Another approach: the wave function must satisfy the boundary conditions. Since the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, perhaps the wave function must be zero at x=1 and x=3. So ψ(1)=0 and ψ(3)=0.

Let me test that. At x=1: ψ(1) = a/sqrt(2) - 0.5i. For this to be zero, both real and imaginary parts must be zero. Real part: a/sqrt(2) = 0 → a =0. But then, the real part is zero everywhere, which doesn't make sense because then the wave function would be purely imaginary. But that would result in a probability function that's |0.5|^2 =0.25, same everywhere between 1 and 3. So the probability would be uniform, but the integral would be (3-1)*0.25 = 0.5, which is a problem because the total probability must be 1. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the wave function is not zero at x=1 and x=3. Maybe the wave function is non-zero only within 1 and 3, and zero outside, but the given expression is a part of the wave function within that interval. So perhaps the wave function is composed of two regions: inside 1<x<3, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, and outside it's zero. But that would make the wave function discontinuous at x=1 and x=3, which might not be physically possible unless it's a boundary condition in an infinite potential well or something. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is such that the probability is zero outside x=1 and x=3. So the probability density |ψ|² is zero outside that region. So the wave function must be zero outside. But the given wave function is a function of x, so perhaps it's only valid within 1<x<3, and outside, it's zero. So to make the wave function continuous, perhaps at x=1 and x=3, the wave function is zero. But then, as I saw before, that leads to a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but then the wave function's real part would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) at x=1, which is a/sqrt(2), and at x=3, a/2. So for the wave function to be zero at x=1 and x=3, the real part would have to go to zero at those points, which would require a to be zero, but that would make the wave function zero everywhere except for the imaginary part, but that can't be right because the square of the magnitude would then be 0.25 everywhere within 1<x<3, leading to a probability that's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. But that's a probability of 0.5, not 1, which is impossible because the integral of the probability must be 1.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. The problem says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means the probability of finding the particle in x <1 or x>3 is zero. So the integral of |ψ|² from -∞ to 1 and from 3 to ∞ must be zero. Therefore, the wave function must be such that when squared, it's zero outside 1 and 3.

But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Let's compute |ψ|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So |ψ|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

But if this is non-zero outside x=1 and x=3, then the integral over those regions would not be zero. So the only way for the probability to be zero outside is for |ψ|² to be zero outside. But |ψ|² is the sum of a real and imaginary part squared, so unless a is zero, which would make the real part zero, but then the imaginary part would be 0.25.

Wait, but if a is zero, then ψ(x) = -0.5i. So |ψ|² is (0)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = 0.25. That's a constant. So the probability density would be 0.25 everywhere, meaning the integral from -infty to 1 would be 0.25*(1 - (-infty)) which is infinite. That's not possible because the total probability can't be infinite. So that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the wave function is only defined within 1<x<3, and zero outside. So that the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 <= x <=3, and zero otherwise. Then, the probability outside is zero, as desired. But in that case, the wave function would have a discontinuity at x=1 and x=3, which is possible only in certain potentials, like infinite wells.

So, if that's the case, then we can proceed to find a such that the wave function is normalized. The integral of |ψ|² from 1 to 3 must be 1. So let's compute that:

Integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = Integral [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Compute the integral:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3 → a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) =0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln(2) → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈0.7213.

So a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈0.8495. Which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me calculate a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → ln(2) is about 0.6931. 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈0.7213 → a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈0.849, which is 0.85, so option B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the approach. The wave function is zero outside 1 and3, so within 1-3, the expression is given, and the normalization integral is from 1 to3.

Another thing to check: the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So if we compute |ψ|², it's (a^2)/(1+x) plus (0.5)^2, because (0.5i) squared is 0.25, but since it's in the imaginary part, the magnitude squared is the sum of squares.

So the integral is correct as a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a≈0.85. So the correct answer is option B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given wave function and the conditions provided. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The problem states that particles are only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), meaning the probability density \(|\psi(x)|^2\) must be zero outside this interval. The probability density is computed as:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left|\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\right|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the normalization condition requires the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over this interval to equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\)
2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 \, dx\)

For the first integral, using the substitution \(u = 1+x\), we find:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.
