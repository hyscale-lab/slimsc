Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So, I think this is about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Since energy is involved and the charges are fixed in some way, it's probably related to calculating the potential energy between them.

Wait, the particles are identical and each has a charge of 2e. So each charge is twice the elementary charge, so 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. That's 3.2e-19 C each.

Now, there are 13 charges. 12 are fixed at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed there, and the others are at a distance of 2 meters from it.

Wait wait, no, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at P, and the other 12 are each at 2m from P. So the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2m.

But wait, the 12 charges are all at 2m from P. So each of
