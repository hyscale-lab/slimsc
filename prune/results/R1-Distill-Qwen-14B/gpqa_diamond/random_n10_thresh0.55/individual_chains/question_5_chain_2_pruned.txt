Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a operator P along some direction n in the x-z plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me think through this.

Alright, the problem says that the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are usually represented as these matrices. Oh right, Pauli matrices! So P must be related to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Let me check: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], which matches P_x. Similarly, σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which matches P_y. And σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is P_z. So yeah, P is the Pauli vector multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is (ħ/2)(σ_x x̂ + σ_y ŷ + σ_zẑ), but wait, no. Wait, no. The operator P is a vector operator, so it's the sum of each component multiplied by the unit vector in that direction. But wait, in the problem, each component P_x, P_y, P_z are given as separate matrices. So the total operator P would be the vector sum of these components multiplied by the direction cosines of the direction vector n. Wait,
