Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again and think through how to approach it.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant is a measure of the stability of that complex. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is pretty stable because K is 5e10, which is a large number.

The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. The question is about the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. I think I need to use the formation constant expression to find [Ca²+].

Wait, what's the formation constant expression again? For a complex like Ca-EDTA, which I'll write as CaY²−, the formation constant K is given by:

K = [CaY²−] / ( [Ca²+] [EDTA⁴−] )

Wait, but wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So the formation constant K is indeed [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But in this problem, the solution contains only the complex, so all the initial EDTA and Ca are tied up in the complex. Wait, no. Let me think. No, wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M.

But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. So, the solution is in equilibrium between the complex and the free ions. But with such a high K, the complex is very stable, meaning most of the Ca and EDTA are tied up in the complex, and very little is free.

So the expression is K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]).

But wait, in pure solution, the total EDTA would be the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But if the solution
