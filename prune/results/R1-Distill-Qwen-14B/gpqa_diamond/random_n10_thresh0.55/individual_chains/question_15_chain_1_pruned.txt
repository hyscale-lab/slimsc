Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which one is more likely to transit. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But here's the thing: even though they have the same mass, Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting, because usually, more massive stars are bigger, but in this case, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but has the same radius, so maybe it's a bit older or something.

The researchers want to observe the planet that has a higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So, I need to determine which planet is more likely to transit based on the given parameters.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. But since both planets are Earth-like, I guess their sizes are similar. But wait, the question says they have the same mass, but not necessarily the same radius. Hmm, but maybe for Earth-like planets, the radius is similar, so perhaps that's not the main factor here.

Wait, the main factors for transit probability are the relative size of the planet to the star and the inclination of the orbit. But since RV method has been used, we know the minimum mass, but the inclination isn't necessarily known. However, the transit method requires the orbital plane to be edge-on (i.e., inclination close to 90 degrees). 

But the question is about the probability of transiting, which is a function of the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The probability is given by the formula: P = (R_p / R_s)Â² * (1 / sin i), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Wait, no, I think the probability of a transit is actually the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability for a transit is approximately (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a_p^2) ), but wait, that might not be right.
