Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

First, let's look at each piece of information given and see what they might indicate about the compound's structure.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. Broad because the H bonds are causing it. So maybe the compound has an alcohol group or maybe a carboxylic acid? Wait, wait, but if it's a very broad peak, I think carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. Or perhaps an ester or something else with O-H groups.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Let me think about those. The 1700 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like C=C. Wait, no, the 1650 could also be an amide or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. But what else? Oh, wait, maybe an ester. Esters have carbonyl peaks around 1700-1750, but sometimes they can be lower. Also, I think that ketones are around 1700, maybe a little lower.
