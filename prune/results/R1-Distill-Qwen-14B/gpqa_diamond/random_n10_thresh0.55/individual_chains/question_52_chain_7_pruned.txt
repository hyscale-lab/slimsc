Okay, let's try to tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when a star has spots. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

So, the star has some parameters: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait. Actually, I think I might be getting this wrong. Because when spots cover part of the surface, the overall brightness changes. But how exactly does that affect the effective temperature?

Oh wait, the question says when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the star's overall Teff is lower because the spots are cooler, I guess. So without spots, it's 6000 K, with spots, it's 5500 K. But wait, how does that affect the photosphere? Because the spots are cooler, the average temperature of the photosphere is lower.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, this ratio is lower than when it doesn't. The question asks by what factor this ratio changesâ€”specifically, the factor when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it
