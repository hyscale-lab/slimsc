Okay, I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) as a low-energy limit and includes higher-dimensional operators to account for new physics effects. These operators are organized by their dimension, usually starting from dimension 6.

Now, the question is about which symmetries these operators must respect. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that the SM respects certain symmetries, and effective theories should preserve the same symmetries unless there's a specific reason not to. So, the SMEFT should preserve the symmetries that the SM has.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Lorentz symmetry refers to the transformations that leave the speed of light invariant (rotations, boosts, etc.), while Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz transformations and translations in space and time. So, Poincare is a larger symmetry group. If an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But does SMEFT require all operators to respect Poincare?

I think the SMEFT is constructed in a way that the operators are Lorentz-invariant. Because the SM is Lorentz-invariant, the SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have effective theories, especially considering non-covariant terms, Poincare might not be a symmetry. Wait, no—Poincare includes translations. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory but does it necessarily have to be Poincare-invariant?

Wait, the SM is Poincare-invariant. So, the SMEFT, which is a low-energy effective theory of the SM, should also respect Poincare symmetry. Because if the SM is Poincare-invariant, then all its effective operators should respect the same symmetries. So operators in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are built as terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian itself must be Poincare-invariant, which implies that each term must be. So yes, all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, but I've heard that some effective theories can have operators that break Poincare symmetry, but I'm not sure. Or maybe in SMEFT, because it's an effective theory for the SM, which is Poincare-invariant, the operators must be Poincare-invariant. So, both Lorentz and Poincare are required. So options that include 1 and 2. Let's see, the options: option A is 1,2; option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, what about CP and CPT symmetry? The SM respects these, but I think in SMEFT, operators can break them if the new physics doesn't respect them. But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, in SMEFT, are the operators required to respect CP and/or CPT?

Hmm. The SM is CP-conserving, but not all of its particles (like the CKM matrix) are, but that's a different point. Wait, the SM itself has CP violation (like in the CKM matrix), so the SMEFT can have operators that violate CP. So, operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry.

CPT symmetry is different. The SM is CPT symmetric. Because in quantum field theory, if a theory is Lorentz invariant, it must be CPT symmetric. So, if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry (which it does), then it must respect CPT symmetry as well. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry, because otherwise the theory would not be Lorentz-invariant, which it must be.

Wait, but wait. The CPT theorem states that in a Lorentz-invariant quantum theory, CPT symmetry holds. So since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, all operators must respect CPT.

So, putting it all together. The operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and since Poincare is a larger symmetry, including translations, but SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, perhaps Poincare is automatically respected? Or do the operators have to individually respect Poincare? Because the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant, which implies each term (operator) must be Poincare-invariant.

So, operators must respect 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare). Also, they must respect 4 (CPT), but not necessarily 3 (CP).

So which options include 1,2,4? Looking at the options:

Option C: 1,2,4
Option D: 1,3,4

So, the correct answer should include 1,2,4. So option C is the right one.

Wait, but I thought I was considering whether operators must respect Poincare. Let me make sure. Because the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, the Lagrangian is Lorentz-invariant. But Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. The terms in the Lagrangian must also be translation-invariant, but translation invariance is part of the definition of a Lagrangian. So the operators must respect Poincare because the Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. So yes, 1 and 2 are required.

Thus, the correct symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The SM is Lorentz-invariant, and since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory of the SM, it must also respect Lorentz symmetry (1). Additionally, Poincaré symmetry (2), which includes Lorentz transformations and translations in space and time, is automatically respected because the SMEFT Lagrangian is Poincaré-invariant. 

CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT, as the theory can include operators that violate CP symmetry depending on the nature of the new physics. However, CPT symmetry (4) must be respected because the SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, and the CPT theorem ensures that Lorentz-invariant theories are CPT-symmetric.

Thus, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).
