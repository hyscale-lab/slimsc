Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about a reaction scheme leading to compound E. There are several steps, so I'll need to go through each one step by step.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

There are also hints provided.

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone.

So the product from the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is a substituent like a methylene group attached to a propyl chain. Let me think about the structure. Propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C-(CH2CH3), wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2=C(CH3)- , right? Wait, no. Propane is CH3CH2CH3. Propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)2. But in the ylide, it's the substituent on the double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(CH3)= something? Not entirely sure, but maybe I can draw it.

So the product of the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and at position 4, a propan-2-ylidene group. So the propan-2-ylidene would be a double bond connected to a cyclopentane.

Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So attached to the cyclopentane ring at position
