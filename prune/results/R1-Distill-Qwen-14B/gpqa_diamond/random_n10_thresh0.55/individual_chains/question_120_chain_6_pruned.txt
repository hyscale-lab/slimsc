Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what it's asking.

The question says, if stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx? The options are A to D, each with different dependencies on 1/plx raised to some power.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/distance. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars per volume is the same everywhere. But wait, this is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I need to relate this to the distribution of parallax values.

Let me think about the volume of space at a certain distance. If I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell would be 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the volume between r and r+dr is approximately the surface area (4πr²) multiplied by dr.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume. So, number of stars N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx, not distance. Parallax plx is 1/d. So, d = 1/plx. Let's express d in terms of plx. So, d = 1/plx, and dd (the change in d) would be related to d plx. Let's see, because plx = 1/d, so d plx = -1/d² dd. Hmm, rearranging, dd = -d² d plx. Since plx is small, I think we can take the negative as just the direction, but since we're dealing with absolute numbers, maybe the sign doesn't matter much.

Wait, let me approach this step by step. Let's express the volume in terms of plx.

The volume element in terms of d is 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/plx, then d² is (1/pl
