Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, so what does that mean? So, the blue ones are probably the dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean each Co has two SCN- ions attached. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^II complex. The stability constants are for the complexes stepwise, I think. Or are they overall? I'm a bit confused.

Stability constant β is usually the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, for each step, the β would be the equilibrium constant for adding another SCN- ion. So, for example, β1 is for Co(SCN)²+ → Co²+ + SCN-? Or wait, maybe it's the formation of the next complex. Let me think.

Wait, the stability constant for the first complex (β1) would be the formation of [Co(SCN)]^2+ from Co²+
