Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted with a series of reagents, and I need to identify the final product from the options provided.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Breaking that down, the degree of unsaturation might help. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Plugging in the numbers: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Calculations: (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a ring and some double bonds or rings.

Now the NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me interpret the NMR. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be that high, but more likely aldehyde here. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group.

The next peak is 6.98 ppm, a doublet of 2H. That's aromatic, probably para-substituted because the coupling is between two protons. Alternatively, it could be ortho, but more likely para.

Then 6.51 ppm, a doublet of 2H. Another aromatic group. Wait, if the first set is a doublet of 2H, and the second is another doublet, maybe they're part of two different aromatic rings. For example, two para-substituted benzene rings.

Then 6.27, broad singlet for 2H. Broad usually suggests exchange with something, maybe OH protons? Or maybe some vinyl protons in a conjugated system, but the singlet part is confusing if it's part of a splitting. Alternatively, maybe a diol or something with two adjacent protons that don't split much.

The last peak is 3.66 ppm, a doublet integrating to 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or part of an ether or ester.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has two aromatic rings (since C8H9NO could include two benzene rings). Wait, benzene is C6H6, so two benzene rings would be C12, but our formula is C8. So maybe each ring isn't benzene but something smaller, or perhaps it's a substituted benzene.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons. If there are two aromatic rings, each probably being a substituted benzene, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps one benzene ring and a smaller structure attached.

Let me think about the NMR again. The 9.72 ppm is probably the aldehyde proton. Then perhaps the structure is something like an aldehyde attached to a chain that has some oxygen-containing groups and an aromatic ring.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H suggests maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Like OCH2CH2... but what's after that?

Looking at the integration: 1H, 2H, 2H, 2H, 2H. So 1+2+2+2+2=9H. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So maybe the compound is of a structure that includes an aromatic ring, an aldehyde, and some other substituents.

Wait, maybe it's a biphenyl structure.
