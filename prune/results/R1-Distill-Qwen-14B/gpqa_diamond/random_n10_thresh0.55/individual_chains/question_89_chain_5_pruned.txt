Okay, so I need to figure out the NMR coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C gives product 1. I remember that when vicinal dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation, typically an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form an adamantylene (I think the double bond would be between the two central carbons in the adamantane structure). The product would be 1,3-diamantadiene or something similar. 

The 1H NMR of product 1 shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet around 2.4-2.23 ppm (10H), and another triplet at 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, that's confusing because the initial reaction is elimination to form a double bond, which wouldn't have a carbonyl. Maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, maybe the initial product isn't an alkene but an epoxide? No, KOH usually deprotonates and does elimination. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Wait, no, substitution with KOH on vicinal dihalides would require a good nucleophile, but I think elimination is more likely here because of the high temperature and excess base. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh, unless the base caused a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement that forms a ketone or ester. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a double elimination leading to an epoxide. No, epoxidation typically uses peracids. Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone via some kind of elimination followed by rearrangement. Wait, maybe the structure isn't a dihalide but a ring with two bromines. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure; 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on opposite faces. Heating with KOH might cause a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation forming a bridgehead double bond, which in adamantane would be possible because of the high ring
