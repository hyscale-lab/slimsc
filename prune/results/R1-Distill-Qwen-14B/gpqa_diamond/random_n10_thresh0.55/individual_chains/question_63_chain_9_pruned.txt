Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. So I guess the photon's momentum needs to match the energy difference between these two states. Wait, but wait, the model is the non-rigid rotor model, right? Or maybe it's the rotation-vibration model. Oh right, the quantum rotation-vibration model, which considers both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, and the lowest rotational state. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state. But what's the next lowest? Oh, I think in such models, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational. So the energy levels are quantized for both rotations and vibrations.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). To find the next state, I'm not sure if it's the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, because the energy levels are such that the next state would be the lowest energy state higher than the current one. So wait, in the rotational-vibration model, the energy depends on both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

Wait, but if the molecule is in the
