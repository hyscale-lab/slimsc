Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with ions like calcium.

Wait, I think the formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, right? And K is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number. That suggests that the complex is very stable, so the reaction favors the product.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So if the complex is formed, most of the calcium would be tied up in the complex, meaning the free calcium concentration is really low. But I need to calculate it.

I remember that for such complexes, the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). Wait, but when you have a solution that's only the complex, what happens? Because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Oh right, the initial solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentrations are [CaEDTA^2
