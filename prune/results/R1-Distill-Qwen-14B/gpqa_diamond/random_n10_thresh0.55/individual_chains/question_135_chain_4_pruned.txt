Okay, so I need to figure out the allowed decay channels for this boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term and the mass of X as 6 GeV. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might have misread that. Maybe it's something like L = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)? Or perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling kind of term. Oh wait, probably the interaction is between the fermion ψ_f and the boson X. So the term suggests that the coupling is proportional to (υ + X), which might imply that υ is a Higgs field, but I'm not entirely sure. But for decay purposes, the key is the interaction term, which tells us what fermions the boson X can decay into.

So the interaction term is something like X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning X couples to pairs of fermions. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it can couple to. But wait, the fermion ψ_f here is a specific type. Oh, but the problem might be that the fermion in the interaction could be any type, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is written in a way that allows X to couple to any fermion, but I need to look at the details.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as -λ f f
