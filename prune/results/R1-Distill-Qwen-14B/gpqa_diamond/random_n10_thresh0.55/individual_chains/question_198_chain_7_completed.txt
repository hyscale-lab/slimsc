Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the question gives me the stability constants β1 to β4. Stability constants are used to determine the concentration of metal complexes in solution. So, the higher the β, the more stable the complex is. Right, β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So, I think I'll need to consider the formation of different Co(SCN)_n complexes, where n is the number of SCN- ions attached.

The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN- ions. Because I remember that the dithiocyanato complex is usually blue, like [Co(SCN)_2]^something. So, I'm looking for the fraction that is Co(SCN)_2^2+ or similar.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants for each step, right? So, β1 is for the first SCN adding, β2 for the second, etc. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of β1 to βn.

Wait no, wait. The overall stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) would be the product of the stepwise constants from β1 to βn. So β_total = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, β_total = β1 =9.

The second complex, [Co(SCN)2]^0, β_total = β1 * β2=9*40=360.

The third, [Co(SCN)_3]^- would have β_total=9*40*63= 22680.

The fourth, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- would have β_total=9*40*63*16= 40320.

Wait, but the problem is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which is n=2. So I need to find the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

But wait, I think the problem is about all possible Co species, which includes [Co(H2O)6]^2+ (the aqua ion), and all the complexes up to [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, the initial solution has Co(II) ions and SCN-. So, the Co exists as various complexes: [Co(H2O)6]^2+ (but wait, the solution doesn't mention H2O, but maybe it's part of the initial species?), or maybe the problem is assuming that all the Co is in the form of these thiocyanato complexes.

Wait, no, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. So the initial Co is Co^2+ and SCN^-.

So, the Co^2+ can form complexes with SCN^- stepwise. The first complex is [CoSCN]^+, then [Co(SCN)2]^0, etc.

So the species are [Co(H2O)6]^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^-, [Co(SCN)4]^2-.

Wait but the problem states that the total Co concentration is 0.01 M, which is the sum of all these complexes. So, the total [Co] is [Co(H2O)6]^2+ + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)2]^0 + [Co(SCN)3]^− + [Co(SCN)4]^2− = 0.01 M.

Hmm, but wait, the problem statement doesn't mention anything about the concentration of water molecules or the presence of other ligands. It just says that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. So perhaps we can ignore the aqua complex and consider only the complexes with SCN^-? Because the problem is focused on the thiocyanato complexes.

Wait, but that might not be right. Because normally, Co^2+ in solution tends to form complexes with water first. But since the problem provides the stability constants for the thiocyanato complexes, perhaps the problem assumes that the Co^2+ is forming these complexes with SCN^-.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the [Co(SCN)_n] complexes, ignoring the aqua ions. So, I'll have to proceed under that assumption unless told otherwise.

So, the approach is to calculate the concentration of each possible complex, then find the fraction that is [Co(SCN)2]^0.

The formation of these complexes is governed by the stability constants. So the formation of each complex is a stepwise process.

The general equation for the n-th complex is: [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n) = β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n / (product of any other terms?), but wait, no. The overall formation constant for the n-th complex is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So, for each complex, the concentration is given by [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but each step adds another SCN^-.

Wait, another way: The concentration of the n-th complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = β1β2...βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n / (denominator terms for each step?), but I might have to think in terms of log K or log β.

Wait, no. Let me think about it more carefully.

For each step, the formation of the next complex is a stepwise process. So, the first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ → K1 = β1 =9.

The second step is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]^0 → K2 = β2=40.

The third step is [Co(SCN)2]^0 + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]^− → K3=63.

The fourth step is [Co(SCN)3]^− + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^2− → K4=16.

So, the overall formation constants for each complex are:

- [CoSCN]^+ → β1=9.

- [Co(SCN)2]^0 → K= β1 * β2=9*40=360.

- [Co(SCN)3]^− → K= β1 * β2 * β3=9*40*63=22680.

- [Co(SCN)4]^2− → K= β1 * β2 * β3 * β4=9*40*63*16= 40320.

Wait, but the problem is that each complex's concentration depends on the product of all β's up to that step.

So, the concentration of each complex is proportional to K_n multiplied by the remaining [Co^2+] and [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but perhaps I can model this with the assumption that the concentration of free Co^2+ is very low because the complexes are more stable, especially with higher β's. But that might not be the case here.

Alternatively, I can model the system using the total concentration of Co and the overall [SCN^-], and the various K's to find the fractions.

The approach is to set up an expression for each species in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-], but since [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M, which is much larger than Co concentrations, perhaps we can approximate [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M throughout.

So, the concentration of each species is:

[Co^2+] = c_total / (something), but perhaps better to set up the fractions.

Let me denote x as the fraction of Co^2+ that remains free, and the rest forms complexes.

But wait, the problem is that each complex's concentration depends on [Co^2+] and [SCN^-] raised to the appropriate power, multiplied by their K.

Wait, perhaps it's better to let [Co^2+] be a variable, say, a.

Then, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of a.

So,

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * a * [SCN^-]^1 = 9 * a * 0.1 =0.9 a.

[Co(SCN)2]^0 = β1 β2 * a * [SCN^-]^2 = 9*40 * a * (0.1)^2 = 360 * a * 0.01 =3.6 a.

[Co(SCN)3]^− = β1 β2 β3 * a * (0.1)^3 = 9*40*63 * a * 0.001 = 22680 * a * 0.001 =22.68 a.

[Co(SCN)4]^2− = β1 β2 β3 β4 * a * (0.1)^4 = 9*40*63*16 *a * 0.0001 =40320 * a * 0.0001=4.032 a.

Wait, but wait, each step's concentration is K_n * a * [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but each K_n is the product of β's up to that step, yes.

So, the total concentration of Co is:

a + 0.9 a + 3.6 a + 22.68 a +4.032 a = 0.01 M.

So, adding all terms:

a (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +4.032) =0.01.

Let me calculate the sum inside the parentheses:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +4.032=32.212.

So, 32.212 a =0.01 → a= 0.01 /32.212 ≈ 0.0003104 M.

So, a is approximately 3.104e-4 M.

Now, calculate the concentration of each complex.

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9 a ≈0.9 * 3.104e-4 ≈2.7936e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^0=3.6 a≈3.6 *3.104e-4≈1.1174e-3 M.

Wait, wait, 3.6 *3.104e-4 is 3.6 * 0.0003104 = 0.00111744 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^−=22.68 a≈22.68 *3.104e-4 ≈0.007076 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2−=4.032 a≈4.032 * 3.104e-4≈0.001251 M.

Wait, wait:

Wait, let me compute each term:

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9 a = 0.9 *3.104e-4 ≈ 2.7936e-4.

[Co(SCN)2]^0=3.6 a=3.6 *3.104e-4= 1.11744e-3.

[Co(SCN)3]^−=22.68 a=22.68 *3.104e-4≈?

22.68 * 3.104e-4 = let's compute 22.68 * 0.0003104.

Hmm, 22 * 0.0003 is 0.0066, so 22.68 *0.0003104= approx 22.68 *3.104e-4.

22.68 *3.104e-4 = 22.68 * 3.104 *1e-4.

22.68 *3.104: let's compute 22 *3=66, 22 *0.104=2.288, 0.68*3=2.04, 0.68*0.104≈0.0707.

So adding all parts: 66 +2.288 +2.04 +0.0707≈ 70.4. So 70.4e-4 = 0.00704 M.

And the fourth complex is 4.032 a =4.032 *3.104e-4.

4 *3e-4=1.2e-3, 0.032 *3e-4=9.6e-6. So approx 1.2096e-3 M.

Wait, let me sum all the concentrations:

a ≈3.104e-4 M.

[CoSCN]^+ ≈2.7936e-4.

[Co(SCN)2]^0≈1.1174e-3.

[Co(SCN)3]^−≈7.04e-3.

[Co(SCN)4]^2−≈1.251e-3.

Adding them up:

3.104e-4 + 2.7936e-4 =5.8976e-4.

Plus 1.1174e-3 →5.8976e-4 +1.1174e-3= 1.7071e-3.

Plus 7.04e-3 → 1.7071e-3 +7.04e-3=8.7471e-3.

Plus 1.251e-3 →8.7471e-3 +1.251e-3=1.000e-2.

Which is 0.01 M, matching the given total Co concentration. So that's correct.

Now, the question is: what is the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. The blue one is [Co(SCN)2]^0.

So, [Co(SCN)2]^0 is 1.1174e-3 M.

The total Co in all species is 0.01 M.

So, the percentage is (1.1174e-3 / 0.01) * 100% = 11.174%.

Wait, that's 11.174%, but none of the options are close to that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

Hmm, none of these are near 11%. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Because I considered only the [Co(SCN)_n] complexes, but perhaps I should include the free [Co^2+], which is a.

Wait, earlier I included a in the total sum, so the sum includes all species, including the free Co^2+.

Wait, but in my calculation, the [Co(SCN)2] is ~1.1174e-3 M. The total is 0.01 M, which is 10 mM. So 1.1174e-3 is 0.0011174 M, which is 1.1174 mM.

So, the fraction is 1.1174 mM /10 mM = 0.11174, so 11.174% of the Co is in the [Co(SCN)2]^0 form.

But none of the options match that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall formation constants, not the stepwise ones. Wait, the question says the stability constants of the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the definition of β. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Wait, the way stability constants are presented, each βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the n-th complex from the (n-1)-th. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^0, etc.

So, the formation of [Co(SCN)2]^0 is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)2]^0, with K=β2=40.

So, perhaps the approach I took is correct.

Wait, but in that case, why isn't the calculated percentage matching any of the options? Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum when adding the terms to get 32.212 a.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum:

The sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +4.032.

1 +0.9 =1.9.

1.9 +3.6 =5.5.

5.5 +22.68 =28.18.

28.18 +4.032 =32.212. So that's correct.

So a=0.01 /32.212 ≈0.0003104 M.

Then,

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9 a =0.9 *0.0003104 ≈0.00027936 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^0=3.6 a=3.6 *0.0003104=0.00111744 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^−=22.68 a=22.68 *0.0003104=0.007076 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2−=4.032 a=4.032 *0.0003104≈0.001251 M.

So, [Co(SCN)2] is 0.00111744 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M. So, 0.00111744 /0.01 = 0.111744, which is about 11.17%.

Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem includes the free [Co^2+] as a separate species. Wait, in my earlier calculation, I did include [Co^2+] as 'a', which is 3.104e-4 M.

Wait, the sum was a + 0.9a +3.6a +22.68a +4.032a =32.212 a=0.01 M.

So, [Co^2+] is 3.104e-4 M, which is 0.0003104 M.

But perhaps, the question is considering the entire set of species, including all possible complexes and the free ion, but perhaps the β's given are for the overall complex formation, not stepwise.

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps βn is the overall stability constant for the n SCN- ligands.

In that case, β1 would be for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^0, etc.

But that would mean that the formation constants for each complex are β1, β2, etc.

In that case, the formation of [Co(SCN)2]^0 would have a formation constant K2=β2=40.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3]^− has K3=β3=63, and [Co(SCN)4]^2− has K4=β4=16.

Wait, no, that would make more sense. Because if each βn is the overall K for the n-th complex, then the problem becomes simpler.

Wait, but the question says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So, perhaps β1 is the overall K for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

So, for each complex, the formation constant is K_n=βn.

Then, the concentration of each complex would be:

[Co^2+] = a.

[CoSCN]^+ = K1 * a * [SCN^-] =9 * a * 0.1.

[Co(SCN)2]^0= K2 * a * [SCN^-]^2 =40 *a *0.1^2.

[Co(SCN)3]^−=K3 *a * [SCN^-]^3 =63 *a *0.1^3.

[Co(SCN)4]^2−= K4 *a * [SCN^-]^4=16 *a *0.1^4.

Wait, but in this scenario, the overall concentration would be a + 9*0.1 a +40*0.01 a +63*0.001 a +16 *0.0001 a =0.01.

Let me compute each term:

a = a.

9*0.1 a =0.9 a.

40 *0.01 a =0.4 a.

63 *0.001 a =0.063 a.

16 *0.0001 a=0.0016 a.

So sum is a*(1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) = a*(2.3646) =0.01.

So, a=0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004226 M.

Wait, that's different. Let me calculate this.

So, a ≈0.004226 M.

Then, each complex's concentration is:

[CoSCN]^+ = 0.9 *0.004226 ≈ 0.003803 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^0=0.4 *0.004226 ≈0.001690 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^−=0.063 *0.004226≈0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2−=0.0016 *0.004226≈0.00000676 M.

Plus the free a=0.004226.

Wait, let me sum all:

a=0.004226.

[CoSCN]^+≈0.003803.

[Co(SCN)2]^0≈0.001690.

[Co(SCN)3]^−≈0.000266.

[Co(SCN)4]^2−≈0.00000676.

Total ≈0.004226 +0.003803=0.008029 +0.001690=0.009719 +0.000266=0.009985 +0.00000676≈0.010 M. Which matches.

Now, the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]^0 is 0.001690 /0.01 = 0.169 =16.9%.

Wait, that's option D) 16.9%.

But wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato is two SCN ligands, which is [Co(SCN)2]^0. So according to this, the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the β's were stepwise, which gave a different result. Now, treating β's as overall formation constants gives option D.

So, I think I made a mistake earlier in assuming that β's are stepwise. The problem probably uses β's as the overall stability constants for each complex.

So, the correct approach is to assume that each βn is the overall K for the formation of the n-th complex from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

So, the concentrations are calculated as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Then, the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] plus [Co^2+] equals the total Co concentration.

In this case, the [Co(SCN)2] is 0.001690 M, which is 16.9% of the total Co.

So, the answer should be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants provided and the given concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The stability constants are interpreted as the overall formation constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) for the complexes [CoSCN]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, respectively.

### Key Steps:
1. **Formation Constants**:  
   The formation constant for each complex is given as:  
   - [CoSCN]⁺: β₁ = 9  
   - [Co(SCN)₂]⁰: β₂ = 40  
   - [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃ = 63  
   - [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄ = 16  

2. **Concentration Expressions**:  
   The concentration of each complex is proportional to its formation constant, the free Co²⁺ concentration ([Co²⁺] = a), and the concentration of SCN⁻ raised to the power of the number of SCN⁻ ligands bound.  
   - [CoSCN]⁺ = β₁ \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻]  
   - [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ = β₂ \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻]²  
   - [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻]³  
   - [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻]⁴  

3. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [Co²⁺] + [CoSCN]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
   \]  
   Substituting the expressions for each species:  
   \[
   a + \beta_1 \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻] + \beta_2 \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻]^2 + \beta_3 \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻]^3 + \beta_4 \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻]^4 = 0.01.
   \]  

4. **Substitute Values**:  
   Given [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, substitute into the equation:  
   \[
   a + (9 \cdot a \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot a \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot a \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot a \cdot 0.1^4) = 0.01.
   \]  
   Simplify each term:  
   - \( a \)  
   - \( 9 \cdot a \cdot 0.1 = 0.9a \)  
   - \( 40 \cdot a \cdot 0.01 = 0.4a \)  
   - \( 63 \cdot a \cdot 0.001 = 0.063a \)  
   - \( 16 \cdot a \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016a \)  

   Combine terms:  
   \[
   a + 0.9a + 0.4a + 0.063a + 0.0016a = 0.01.
   \]  
   \[
   2.3646a = 0.01 \implies a = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004226 \, \text{M}.
   \]  

5. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   The concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is:  
   \[
   [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ = \beta_2 \cdot a \cdot [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004226 \cdot (0.1)^2.
   \]  
   \[
   [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ = 40 \cdot 0.004226 \cdot 0.01 = 0.001690 \, \text{M}.
   \]  

6. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ among all cobalt species is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[Co(SCN)₂]⁰}{\text{Total Co Concentration}} \times 100 = \frac{0.001690}{0.01} \times 100 = 16.9\%.
   \]  

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.  
**Answer: D**
