Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a multiple-choice question, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of protons and neutronsâ€”wait, that means the molecule is made of an element where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. So, for example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But wait, if the molecule is a gas, maybe it's something like CO2 or H2O? Or maybe it's an elemental gas like O2 or N2. Wait, but the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about that.

So each molecule of gas W has protons and neutrons in equal numbers. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O: each molecule has (H: 1p, 0n each; O: 8p, 8n). So per molecule, total protons would be 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Neutrons would be 2*(0) +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it. What about CO2? Each CO2 molecule has C (6p, 6n) and two O (8p, 8n each). So per molecule: (6+2*8) protons = 22, and (6 + 2*8) neutrons = 22. So 22 each. Oh wait, that's equal. So the molecule would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits! So gas W is CO2.

Wait, but another possibility: what about O2? Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each O2 molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That also fits. Oh, so it's either CO2 or O2. But wait, what about other possibilities? Like N2: N has 7p and 7n each. So N2 would have 14p and 14n. Also fits. So W could be N2, O2, CO2, or maybe even CH4? No, CH4 would have C(6
