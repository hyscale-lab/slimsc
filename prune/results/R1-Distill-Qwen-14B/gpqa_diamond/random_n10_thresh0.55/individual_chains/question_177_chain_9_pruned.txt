Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times bigger. The wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are different: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. The question is about the luminosity ratio, calculated as black bodies. The options are A to D, each a number around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm, I remember that the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies. So the peak wavelength where they emit most strongly (like the peak of their blackbody spectrum) is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says λ_max ≈ constant / T, where T is the star's temperature. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same, because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, but wait, when you have a star moving towards us (or away), its emitted light is Doppler shifted. So the observed wavelength would change. But the problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (the λ_max) are the same. So does that mean that the observed λ_max is the same, or the intrinsic λ_max is the same?

Ah, right, because the star's velocity affects the observed wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s relative to us, we might observe a different λ_max than the intrinsic one. So we'd have to correct for the Doppler shift to find their intrinsic temperatures.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think. The problem states that "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. That complicates things because Star_2 is moving, so its observed λ_max would be different from its actual
