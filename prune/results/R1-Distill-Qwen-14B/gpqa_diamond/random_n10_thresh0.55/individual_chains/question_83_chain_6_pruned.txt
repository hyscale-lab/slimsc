Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25 °C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so first, I need to tackle the two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point. Let me think about each part separately.

Starting with the first part: the dilution of acetic acid. Wait, but actually, after that, we titrate it with NaOH. So maybe I don't need to calculate the initial concentration after dilution yet, because the titration steps will change the concentration as we add NaOH.

Wait, no, the titration is of the diluted solution. So the initial solution after dilution is important because that's what we're titrating.

So first, calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L).

So the concentration after dilution is (volume1 x concentration1) / total volume.

So (0.020 L * 0.05 mol/L) / 0.040 L = (0.001 mol) / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. So when diluted, its concentration becomes 0.025 M. But when we titrate it, the amount of NaOH added will change the solution.

Now, the titration: we're adding 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is finding the pH at 25% titration. So, 25% of the equivalence point volume
