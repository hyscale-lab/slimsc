Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means their density is the same everywhere. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. 

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, like, for a given range of parallax values, how does the number of stars in each such range vary as plx changes.

Wait, I think I need to model this. Let's see, the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's denote N as the number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. 

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant, say n. So the total number of stars in a region depends on the volume of that region.

But how does parallax relate to volume? Parallax plx is equal to 1/distance (d), so d = 1/plx. The distance in parsecs, I think. So, a star with parallax plx is at distance d = 1/plx parsecs.

Now, if I imagine a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is the difference between (4/3)π(d+dd)^3 and (4/3)πd³, which approximately becomes 4πd² dd for small dd.

So, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But wait, the problem is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I should express this in terms of plx instead of d. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Let's substitute d in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in d when plx changes by dplx. Let me find dd in terms of dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. Hmm, the negative sign means that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering the absolute change, maybe I can ignore the sign for now.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into the volume expression:

Number of stars in shell = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/(plx)^2) dplx )

Wait, but the d is 1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx². And dd is -1/plx² * dplx. So putting it all together:

Number of stars, dN = n * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/(plx²) dplx )

Wait, but dN is a positive quantity, so maybe the negative just tells me that as plx increases, d decreases, which is correct. So, taking the absolute value, we have:

dN = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) ) * dplx? Wait, wait, no,
