Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. Oh right, it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. And we're supposed to find v_max, the maximum speed. Oh wait, and the speed of light is c, so relativity must come into play here.

I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². So equating those, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem. So classical mechanics might not apply directly.

In relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy is gamma mc², which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic.

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential at any point. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all energy is potential: (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, which is (gamma-1)mc².

Wait, but in the classical case, the energy is just (1/2)kA², so in the relativistic case, the same total energy must hold. So the total energy E should be equal to (1/2)kA².

So E = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Hmm, but wait a second. Actually, for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², right? Because Hooke's law is F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, its potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. But wait, in relativity, the total energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), but for a non
