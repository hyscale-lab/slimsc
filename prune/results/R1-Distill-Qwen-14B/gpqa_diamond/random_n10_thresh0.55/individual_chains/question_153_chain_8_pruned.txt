Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually an enolate, attacks the beta position, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's start with part A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the reagent is NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I think NaOEt is a base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The structure is (CH3COO)2CH. When deprotonated, the enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Wait, the structure of that is CH2-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the alpha carbon. So the acrylate is maybe CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but substituted with p-tolyl at the alpha position. So the structure is more like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but substituting at the 3-position (the middle CH2?), wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2- something? I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the acrylate is CH2=C(COR)COOR, but maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Alternatively, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, I think the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl substituent on the CH2. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the structure is CH2 attached to the p-tolyl group, then a double bond to CH, and then the COOCH3 group.

Wait, but for the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) should attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, in this case, the acrylate is the Michael acceptor because it has the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. So the acrylate's structure is CH2=C(p
