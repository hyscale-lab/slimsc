Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A, which gives a specific product. I need to choose the right reagent A and catalyst B from the options provided.

Alright, so first, let's try to understand the reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Wait, what's that structure look like? Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring. The substituents are at positions 1 and 3. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached at position 1. Cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, so like a cyclohexenyl group, but the way it's written, it's cyclohexylidene methyl, so maybe a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (CH₂) perhaps?

Wait, no, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Let me parse that. The 'methyl' part is a CH₂- group attached to the cyclohexylidene. 'Cyclohexylidene' means a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH₂ groups is replaced with a double bond, but perhaps more accurately, it's a cyclohexene substituent. So the substituent is like a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene group. So, maybe something like a cyclohexene connected to the pyrrolidine via a CH₂ group, but with a double bond in the cyclohexene part.

So, the product would be a bicyclic structure perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with a methyl at position 3. Now, adding a substituent at position 1 as (cyclohexylidenemethyl). So, let's imagine the structure: the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a CH₂ group connected to a cyclohexene ring. So, the substituent is CH₂-cyclohexene.
