Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about neutrino flux from the Sun after the pp-III branch stops. Hmm. I remember that the pp chain is a major source of energy in the Sun, and the pp-III branch is a specific part of that process. 

Wait, the pp chain produces neutrinos, right? Specifically, the proton-proton chain has different branches, and the pp-III branch is one of them. Oh right, the main neutrinos we detect from the Sun are from the pp-I branch, which produces a lot of neutrinos at around 25 MeV, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, I think the pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to the heavier elements' burning. Or was it the opposite?

No, wait. The proton-proton chain is the dominant source of solar energy, and it produces neutrinos through the process where a boron-8 nucleus decays into two helium-3 nuclei, but actually, wait, the pp chain typically produces neutrinos in the 1-10 MeV range. The main neutrino line is around 17 MeV, but wait, actually, that's more the pep branch. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the pp chain has two main branches: the dominant pp-I and the less significant pp-II and pp-III. The pp-I branch produces a proton and a positron, releasing a neutrino. The pp-III branch might involve higher temperatures or different reaction pathways. Oh, and the neutrinos from the pp chain have lower energies than those from the CNO cycle or other processes, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So it's about the distribution of neutrino energies. 

If the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain, right? So if it stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch would cease. But wait, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to pp-I. Because, for example, the pp-I produces neutrinos at around 0.5 MeV (but wait, no, higher than that?), while pp-III might produce higher energies. Or maybe I'm getting that backwards.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The main pp-I process produces a neutrino when
