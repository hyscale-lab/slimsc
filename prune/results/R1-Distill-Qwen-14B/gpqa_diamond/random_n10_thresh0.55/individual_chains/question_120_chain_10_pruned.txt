Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's think about this.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The parallax of a star (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So if a star is closer, it has a larger parallax, and if it's farther away, the parallax is smaller. That makes sense because the closer stars show a more noticeable shift in position when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit.

The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, probably uniformly in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant throughout the volume. So, the same number of stars are spread out in each spherical shell as you go further away.

Wait, but how does that translate to parallax? Parallax plx is proportional to 1/distance. So maybe I need to think in terms of how many stars fall into a certain range of parallax, which corresponds to a range of distances.

Let's model this. Suppose the number density of stars is n (stars per unit volume). So in a small volume element, the number of stars is n times the volume.

In spherical coordinates, the volume element is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr is n * 4π r² dr.

Now, parallax plx is equal to 1/(distance * some constant). Let's ignore the constant for now and say plx ~ 1/r. So r ~ 1/plx.

If I want to find the number of stars per unit parallax, I need to see how many stars are in a range of plx. Let's say plx goes from plx to plx + dplx. That corresponds to r from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express dr in terms of dplx. Since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but I'm considering a small change, so maybe dr = (1/( (plx)^2 )) dplx.

Wait, the volume element is 4π r² dr. Plugging in r = 1/plx, which is d = 1/parallax. So r squared is (1/plx)^2. And dr is (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting into the number of stars: n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, so the number of stars in a small range of parallax dplx is proportional to (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number decreases as parallax increases, which makes sense because closer stars are fewer in number when considering a unit parallax interval.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So the number density in plx space is proportional to 1/plx^4. So looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. Option D is 1/plx^3.

Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning. I have the volume element as 4π r² dr. Then, since plx is proportional to 1/r, dr is proportional to -dplx/(plx²). So plugging in, the number of stars in a dplx interval is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx^2)) ). Oh wait, that would be (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx, so 1/plx^4 dplx. So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4 per unit parallax.

So the correct option would be A) ~1/plx⁴.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because another approach might consider the cumulative number of stars up to a certain parallax. But the question is about the number per unit range, which is the differential,
