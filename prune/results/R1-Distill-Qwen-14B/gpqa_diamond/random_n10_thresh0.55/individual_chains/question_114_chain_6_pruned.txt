Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one, NaCN, and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options for A and B are given as combinations of H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Hmm. Let me recall what I know about these types of reactions. 

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. I think butan-2-one is methyl isopropyl ketone, right? Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So that's methylacetone.

NaCN is sodium cyanide, which I remember is a nucleophile. So maybe this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide, under certain conditions, it typically undergoes addition. Wait, but ketones are less reactive towards nucleophilic addition compared to aldehydes because they are less electrophilic. However, in some cases, especially when the ketone is a cyclic one or under specific conditions, they can react.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a straightforward ketone. So maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. But wait, usually in such cases, we use a catalyst. Or maybe it's about the mechanism. Let me think: when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, perhaps under basic conditions, it's possible to form a cyanohydrin. Oh right, a cyanohydrin is an addition product where the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and then water (or another nucleophile) adds to the oxygen as it becomes a better leaving group. Wait, but in the product, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So it's a secondary alcohol attached to a nitrile.

Wait, but the product is a hydroxy
