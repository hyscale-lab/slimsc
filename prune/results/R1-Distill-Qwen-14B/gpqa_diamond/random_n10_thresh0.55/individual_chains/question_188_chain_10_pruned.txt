Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I need to find the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Wait, rhombohedral crystals are a type of Bravais lattice where all the edges are equal and the angles between them are the same. But wait, in this case, the angles are 30 degrees each, which is pretty small. 

So the question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait a second. The interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms. In a crystal structure, this would relate to the lattice parameter 'a', right? But for a rhombohedral structure, the lattice is a bit more complex than a cubic or other structures. 

Wait, rhombohedral can be thought of as a special case of the hexagonal structure, but no, hexagonal has different properties. Alternatively, rhombohedral is also called the trigonal crystal system. Oh, right, so the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which has all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (alpha = beta = gamma). But sometimes, for a cubic system, all the angles are 90 degrees, but in this case, all are 30 degrees. 

I remember the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by 1/d^2 = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk)/(a² cos² α
