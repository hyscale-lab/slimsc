Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what it's asking for.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, so each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge? Right, e is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. And all these particles have negligible mass, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy aspects here. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Hmm, point P... Oh wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is like 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters away from point P, where the 13th charge is located. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, but I'll get to them after working through the problem.

I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when charges are placed in an electric field, they have potential energy. Since the system is isolated, I probably need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy between all the charges.

Wait, but what's the formula for the electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges? I remember that the potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But since this system has multiple charges, I should consider the potential energy between every pair.

Wait, but if all the 12
