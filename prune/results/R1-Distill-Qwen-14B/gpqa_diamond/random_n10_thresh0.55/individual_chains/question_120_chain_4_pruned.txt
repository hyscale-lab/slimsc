Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. Let me think. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth during different times of the year. The closer the star, the larger the parallax, right? Because the Earth's orbit is kind of a big circle, so nearby stars would show a bigger change in their position relative to more distant ones.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. So, they are spread out evenly in space. Wait, uniform distribution in space—does that mean in all directions, so no clumping? I think that's what uniform distribution implies.

The problem asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. So, it's about the number density of stars as a function of parallax. Parallax is usually denoted as 'plx' in the question. I need to find how N, the number of stars per unit plx, varies with plx.

I remember that distance and parallax are inversely related. The formula I think is plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So, d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars (smaller d) have larger parallax.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) would be constant. Let's say the number density is n. So, in any volume, the number of stars would be n multiplied by that volume.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. How do I relate parallax to volume? I think I need to express the volume in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then for a given range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Let me think: plx = 1/d, so if plx increases, d decreases. So for a small change in plx, d changes inversely. Let's express the distance range. If plx goes from plx to plx + dplx, then the corresponding distances go from d = 1/plx to d + dd, where dd is the change in distance.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the distance range in terms of plx. Let's say we're looking at a thin shell between distance d and d+dd. The volume of this thin shell would be 4π d² dd, since it's a spherical shell. But wait, in reality, since the distribution is uniform and possibly in all directions, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd would be n * 4π d² dd.

But in the question, we're considering a range of parallax, which is a range in plx. So plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The change in d (dd) when plx changes by dplx would be dd = (d plx) * d^3? Wait, maybe I should calculate the relationship between dd and dplx.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd/ddx = derivative of d with respect to plx. Let me compute that: d = (1/plx), so dd = (-1/(plx)^2) dplx. Hmm, so for a small change in
