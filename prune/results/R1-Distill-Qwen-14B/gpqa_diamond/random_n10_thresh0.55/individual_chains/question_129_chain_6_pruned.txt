Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions yet. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are some hints provided, so I'll need to pay attention to those too.

First, the reaction steps:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:
a) Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to give 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR of A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's is around 1715.

Let me think about each part.

Starting with the first reaction: A + HCN → B.

HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A reacts with HCN, it's likely that A is a ketone or aldehyde because HCN adds to the carbonyl. The product B would be a cyanohydrin. But wait, sometimes HCN can also add to esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds. But the peak in IR for A is around 1750, which is typical for an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, ketones are around 1700-1750, but esters are a bit higher, 1740-1760. So the IR of A has a peak at 1750, which suggests maybe an ester. Hmm, but then HCN adding to an ester? Not sure. Alternatively, if A is a ketone, then HCN would add to form a cyanohydrin. Let's think about that.

Wait, but wait. The hint a) says that A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So, the Wittig reaction forms alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. So if A is a carbonyl compound (like a ketone), reacting with a ylide would give an alkene.

The product from the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to visualize that structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents: at position 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2 group attached to a proton in a certain way. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part—so perhaps it's a CH2 group connected as a double bond. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl, and at position 4, a CH2 group attached via a double bond. So the ylid part would form a double bond.

Wait, in the Wittig
