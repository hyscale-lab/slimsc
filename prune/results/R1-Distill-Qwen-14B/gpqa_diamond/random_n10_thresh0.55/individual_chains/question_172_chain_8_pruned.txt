Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the temperature because of something called the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—it's close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference delta E is k_B * something, but in this case, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly Boltzmann's constant times 1 (since k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K). So delta E = k_B * 1.

Wait, no, wait. The energy between levels is given, and the problem says to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so the Boltzmann factor applies. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, in this problem, the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same energy level being considered. So the energy difference for each star is the same. Wait, no, actually, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is the same for both stars. So E2 - E1 is same for both.

Let me get the setup right. Let’s denote:

For star 1: the number of excited atoms is n1. For star 2: n2. The problem states that n1 = 2 * n2. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think that the excitation level (n) is higher. So n1 = 2 n2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, wait. Let me re-read. "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared
