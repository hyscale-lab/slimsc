Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. The options are A to D, each a different power of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star. The formula I think is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). Oh right, because distance d = 1 / plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

The problem says the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5 because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question isn't about how N depends on d directly. It asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. Hmm. So I think that's about the differential—like the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe it's the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The number of stars per unit volume probably depends on distance. But the question is about per unit distance, r. Hmm, maybe it's the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr. So the number would be the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) multiplied by the number per unit area. Wait, but how does that relate to the given relation?

Wait, the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Plx is in arcseconds, and d (distance) is in parsecs. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N = k * d^5 where k is some constant. But how does that translate to number per unit distance?

Oh wait, I think I need to find dN/dr. Because the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^4. But wait, the options are in terms of 'r', so perhaps I'm using r instead of d. Let
