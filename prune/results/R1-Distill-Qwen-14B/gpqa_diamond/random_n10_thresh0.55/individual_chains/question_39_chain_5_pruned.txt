Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle. 

From the problem, each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region because if the wave function is zero, the probability of finding the particle there is zero.

Wait, actually, the wave function being zero would mean no probability, right? Because the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So if the wave function is zero, the probability is zero. But wait, in this case, the wave function given is a function of x. So, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Hmm, no, wait. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, perhaps I should think about normalization here. Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability must be 1, so the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1.

Wait, but the problem states that when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So, that suggests that the wave function is zero outside of this interval. So maybe the wave function given is only valid between
