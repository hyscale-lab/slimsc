Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives me two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The problem is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. 

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I remember that in special relativity, you have to use the velocity addition formula. Let me recall what that formula is. I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, no, wait. Because the direction is the same, so one's velocity is higher than the other. So maybe I need to calculate how one sees the other moving.

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second? Or vice versa? Because in relativity, the relative speed depends on whose frame you're considering. But the problem just says 'relative speed' without specifying, which could be ambiguous. But perhaps the question is asking for the speed of one relative to the other. Let's assume it's the speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first's frame, or the other way around. Wait, wait, no, the formula is symmetric in a way. Let me get the exact formula right.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, when you're adding velocities, if you have an object moving at u' in the frame S', which is moving at speed v relative to S, then the speed u in S is (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/(c²)). But in our case, both are moving in the same direction. So perhaps the relative speed is calculated as (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)) if we are considering the speed of the second as seen from the first.

Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what speed is B moving at? The relative speed would be (v
