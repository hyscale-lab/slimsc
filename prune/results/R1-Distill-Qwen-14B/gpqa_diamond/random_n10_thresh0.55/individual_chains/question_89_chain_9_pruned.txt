Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start breaking it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid. The starting material is di-bromo, which suggests that elimination or substitution reactions might happen.

The first reaction is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination is the main pathway here. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with strong bases, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, here it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, not 1,2. Hmm, so they're not adjacent. Oh, right, but in adamantane's structure, the substituents are on adjacent carbons because of the structure. Wait, maybe it's actually 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the bromines are on carbons that are, in the adamantane skeleton, three bonds apart? Or maybe the two Brs are on adjacent carbons? I'm a bit fuzzy on adamantane's structure. Let me think. Adamantane has a diamond-like structure, each carbon connected to four others in a tetrahedral arrangement. The 1,3-dibromo would probably mean that the two Brs are on opposite ends of a bridge or something. Maybe they're on adjacent carbons in the structure? Because if they're vicinal, elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, heating with KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction. Since the starting material is a dihalide, the product after KOH would probably be an alkene. But because it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form a bridge, perhaps creating a cyclohexene-like ring within the adamantane structure. So product 1 would be an adamantane with a double bond—maybe 1,3-diene or something similar. 

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group
