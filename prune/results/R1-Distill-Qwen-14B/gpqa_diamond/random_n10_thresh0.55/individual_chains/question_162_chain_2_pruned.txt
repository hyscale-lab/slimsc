Okay, so I have this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But in this case, since we're talking about a pseudosphere, I think it's a two-dimensional surface, so maybe we're looking at a metric in two dimensions.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid. Oh, right, it's an example of a surface with hyperbolic geometry. But how does the metric given here relate to that?

Let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So that looks a bit like the condition x² + y² < 4, which would imply that we're working within a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Because if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric components blow up, which probably means the curvature becomes infinite there.

Wait, but how do I find the area of this pseudosphere. Oh, right, for a surface with a given metric, the area can be computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. Or wait, maybe it's just the determinant... Let me recall.

In two dimensions, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. But wait
