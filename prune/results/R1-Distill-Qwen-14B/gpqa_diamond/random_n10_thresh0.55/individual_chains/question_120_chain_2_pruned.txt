Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, right? Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember some basic concepts from my astronomy class.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, uniform distribution in space might mean that the number density of stars is the same everywhere. But wait, how does that translate when we look at parallax?

Parallax (plx) is related to distance. I remember that parallax in arcseconds (") is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx (in ") = 1 / distance (in parsecs). That means closer stars have larger parallaxes, and more distant stars have smaller parallaxes.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. So, we're looking at N(Δplx), the number of stars in a small range of parallax Δplx. How does this number depend on plx?

Wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density (n) is constant. Number density is stars per unit volume. But when we observe them, the number we see depends on the volume of space that contributes to a given range of parallax.

Let me think about the geometry here. The parallax formula is plx = 1 / d, where d is distance. So, for a star at distance d, the parallax is plx. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx would correspond to stars at distances between d and d + dd, where dd is a small change in distance.

Wait, let's get the relationships straight. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that comes from differentiating both sides: d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're dealing with small ranges, maybe we can take the magnitude. So, the change in distance dd is proportional to 1/(plx²) times dplx. Because dplx is positive, and plx decreases as distance increases, so when plx decreases, d is increasing.

But we're interested in the number of stars in a range of plx, which corresponds to a range of d. So, the number of stars in that range would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume between d and d + dd
