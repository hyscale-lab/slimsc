Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember something about the speed of light in different media and how motion affects it. Let me think.

The question says the glass has an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. So I'm supposed to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer in the lab.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, right? So in the glass, it's c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving.

So I think this is a problem involving relative velocity. But I'm a bit confused because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. But wait, maybe this is a non-relativistic case because v is much smaller than c, so we can use the Galilean addition instead of relativistic addition.

Galilean addition says that if you have an object moving at u in a frame, and the frame itself is moving at v relative to another frame, the object's speed in the lab frame is u + v. But wait, that's for velocities in the same direction. But here, the light's speed in the glass is less than c, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So does that mean we just add the velocities?

Wait, no. Because the light's speed in the glass is c/n. Let me think: the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light is moving in the
