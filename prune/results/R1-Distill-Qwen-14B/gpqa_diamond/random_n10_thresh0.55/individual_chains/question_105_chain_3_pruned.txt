Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the scenario is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The question says that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing similar brightness changes. We need to find what exoplanet radius would produce the same light curve amplitude. So, the options are about Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

Hmm, so I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The depth of the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet's radius over the star's radius. That formula is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if I can compute that, I'll get the dip percentage.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't being blocked by a planet, but by spots. However, the question says that the situation resembles an exoplanet—so the change in brightness is similar. So I need to model the brightness variation due to the spots and see what planet radius would cause the same dip.

The star's radius (Rstar) is the same as the Sun's, which is about 7e5 km, but maybe I don't need the exact value because I'm dealing with ratios.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, so if one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that, the total area covered is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar².

Wait, no, wait. The star is a sphere, so the entire surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². So if the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) ) = 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star rotates, only a part of the hemisphere is visible. Oh no, wait, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. So as the star spins, the spots cover a varying fraction of the star's disk as seen from Earth (or wherever the observer is).

But the question is about the photometric time-series showing periodic variations in brightness. So the brightness change is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation depends on the difference in brightness between the spotted and non-spotted areas.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The flux from the star without spots is higher than with spots, but when spots rotate into view, the total flux decreases, causing a dip.

Wait, but how much does this dip amount to? Let's model this.

The star's total flux when the spots are not visible is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R²)
