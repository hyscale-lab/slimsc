Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says ESPRESSO can detect stars brighter than magnitude 17 V. Wait, no, wait. Wait, brighter than 17 mag? Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So stars with V less than or equal to 17 would be detectable by ESPRESSO. Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, because the magnitude scale is inverted. So if a star is brighter than 17, it's magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17. So any star with apparent V magnitude ≤17 can be observed.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So same logic: stars with V ≤16 can be observed by HIRES.

So the question is which stars are bright enough (apparent V mag ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES) to be detected by both.

Let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). d is 10 pc, so log(1
