Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, and HIRES is at Keck. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning they can see up to about 17, but not fainter than that. HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag in V should be detectable by both, but if a star is fainter than 16 mag, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can if it's brighter than 17.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that would mean stars with V magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed, so they need V ≤16 mag. So a star must have V ≤16 to be seen by both.

So the key is to find which stars have V apparent magnitudes ≤16.

But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes and distance, so I need to calculate their apparent V magnitudes. Oh right, because absolute magnitude is how bright they are at 10 pc, and their actual brightness depends on distance.

The formula to calculate apparent magnitude is m = M +5 +5 log10(d), where d is distance in parsecs.

Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Oh right, because the formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude. Also, some stars have extinction, which affects their apparent magnitude. Extinction is the dimming due to dust, which is given by E(B-V). The V band magnitude is affected as m_V = m_V0 + 3.1 * E(B-V), where m_V0 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude. Wait, no, no. Wait, the formula is usually m_observed = m_intrinsic + extinction. The extinction in V band is A_V = R * E(B-V), where R is about 3.1. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Alternatively, the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5 + A_V.

Wait, let me get that right. So each star's apparent magnitude without extinction would be M +5 log10(d) -5. Then, if there's extinction (dust), it's m = (M +5 log10(d) -5) + 3.1 * E(B-V). Because the extinction in V is 3.1 times the color excess E(B-V).

So let's process each star one by one.

Star1: RA 15, DEC -75, Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc. So compute m.

m = 15.5 +5 log10(10) -5.

log10(10) =1. So 5*1=5. So 15.5 +5 -5 = 15.5. So m=15.5.

No extinction mentioned, so E(B-V)=0. So V=15.5. Since HIRES can go up to 16, this star is brighter than 16 (15.5<16) so it can be seen by both. Because ESPRESSO can take up to 17. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2: RA 30, DEC 55, apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Wait, wait, the star's apparent magnitude is given as 16.5? So that's the observed m, which already includes extinction? Or is the V mag before extinction? Hmm, the question says, 'apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag'—so that's the observed magnitude. So no need to compute. So m=16.5.

So for HIRES, max is 16. So 16.5 is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it's not a candidate for both.

Star3: RA 11h, DEC48, apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc. Wait, wait, do I need to compute its intrinsic magnitude and then add extinction? Or is the given V mag already the observed (including extinction)? The question says 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6...'. Hmm, I think the apparent magnitude is the observed, but to compute the intrinsic, perhaps.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-express the problem. The question says that for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, I'm not sure if the 15.5 is the observed or the intrinsic. Because the question says, 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.'

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the given apparent V is 15.5, but the star is at 15 pc. So does the apparent V include the extinction, or is it the intrinsic? Hmm, I think in this setup, the given apparent V is after considering the extinction. Because if you're given the distance, then the apparent magnitude is the observed (including extinction). So in that case, the V given is the observed. But wait, wait, actually, the way the question is phrased, it's Star3: apparent V of 15.5, which includes E(B-V). So perhaps we need to compute the intrinsic, but wait, no, the way the data is given, perhaps the star's apparent V is already 15.5, which is after extinction. So perhaps I don't need to adjust it. Hmm, but wait, the problem says that the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic, and the extinction is adding to it?

Wait, perhaps the way to think is that the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude without extinction would be m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(d) -5. Then, the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V = m_intrinsic + 3.1 * E(B-V).

But wait, in the case of Star3, the question gives the apparent V as 15.5, which includes the extinction. So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed. So to find the intrinsic m, we subtract the extinction. Wait, no: m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. So if the given m_observed is 15.5, and A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86, then the intrinsic m_intrinsic = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But why would I care about the intrinsic?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The problem is to find which stars can be detected by both instruments, so I need to find their apparent V magnitudes as observed (i.e., including extinction) because that's what determines whether it's bright enough.

Wait, no. Because to know if a star is seen by the instrument, it's the apparent magnitude as observed (after extinction) that matters. So for each star, I need to compute its apparent magnitude, including extinction, and see if it's ≤16 for both.

But for some stars, we have to compute the apparent magnitude based on their absolute magnitude and distance, then add extinction. For others, their apparent magnitude is given, but perhaps we have to adjust for extinction.

Wait, let's clarify:

Star1: Given absolute magnitude M=15.5, distance=10 pc. So compute m=M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=10, log10(10)=1.

m=15.5 +5*1 -5 =15.5 +5-5=15.5. So m=15.5.

Star1 has no E(B-V) mentioned, so no extinction. So m_observed=15.5.

Star2: given apparent V=16.5, but that's already the observed magnitude. So m=16.5.

Star3: given apparent V is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the apparent V is already observed, then the extinction is already included. So perhaps the given apparent V is the intrinsic (without extinction), and the observed is higher due to extinction. Or perhaps the given is the observed. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait the question says: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1.'

Wait, perhaps the apparent magnitude is the observed (so including extinction), but the way it's phrased, perhaps the given m is the observed. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed as if the given m is the observed, so no further adjustment is needed. But wait, the note says that the absorption is 3.1 * E(B-V). So perhaps we have to compute the apparent magnitude including this absorption.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the apparent magnitude without extinction for the stars that have E(B-V), then calculate the observed magnitude by adding the absorption.

Wait, but for Star3, the given m is 15.5, but if the star's E(B-V)=0.6, then the observed m would be 15.5 + 3.1 *0.6 = 15.5 +1.86 =17.36. But this is the observed. But if that's the case, then Star3's m is 17.36, which is fainter than both ESPRESSO's limit (17) and HIRES's limit (16). So it can't be detected by either.

Wait, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), so we have to compute the observed by adding the extinction.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude in the question is the 'intrinsic' m, and we have to add the extinction to find the real m. Because if a star is at a certain distance, its apparent V is m = M +5 log10 (d) -5, plus extinction.

So for Star3, M is not given. Wait, wait, wait. Let me check each star.

Star3: RA=11h, DEC=48, apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Wait, so M is the absolute magnitude. But the question doesn't give M, it gives apparent V. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps Star3's apparent V is the observed (so including extinction), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V is the intrinsic, and we have to compute the observed by adding the extinction.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the problem as follows:

For each star, compute the apparent V magnitude (observed), which is the sum of the intrinsic apparent magnitude and the extinction in V (A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)).

But for some stars, the apparent V is given as observed. For others, it's given as intrinsic, and we have to compute the observed.

Wait, perhaps I should process each star systematically.

Star1: M=15.5, d=10. So compute m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(10) -5 =15.5 +5 -5=15.5. No E(B-V), so A_V=0. So observed m=15.5.

Star2: apparent V=16.5. So already observed, no E(B-V) given, so m=16.5.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So I'm not sure whether 15.5 is observed or intrinsic. Hmm, but the star's distance is 15 pc. So perhaps the given 15.5 is the intrinsic (before extinction) apparent magnitude. So to get the observed, we'd add A_V.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 (apparent V without extinction). Then, A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So observed m =15.5 +1.86 =17.36.

So m=17.36. Which is above 17, so ESPRESSO can't detect it. HIRES can't either since it's limited to 16.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

So compute m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(10) -5=15.5+5-5=15.5. Then, A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So observed m=15.5+1.24=16.74.

Wait, 15.5 +1.24 is 16.74, which is brighter than 16? No, 16.74 is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it because HIRES requires m ≤16. So only ESPRESSO can see it because 16.74 <17.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc. So m_intrinsic =16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=~0.69897. So 5 * 0.69897≈3.495.

So m_intrinsic =16.5 +3.495 -5 =16.5 +3.495=19.995 -5=14.995. Approximately 15.0.

No E(B-V) given, so A_V=0. So observed m=15.0.

So for each star, the observed V:

Star1: 15.5 → ≤16 for both.

Star2:16.5 → HIRES can't, ESPRESSO can.

Star3:17.36 → Both can't.

Star4:16.74 → Both can't.

Star5:15.0 → ≤16 for both.

So which stars can be detected by both? Those with m ≤16.

So Star1 (15.5) and Star5 (15.0). So which options include these?

Looking at the options:

Options are A to D.

Option D: Star1 and Star4.

Wait, Star1 is 15.5, which is detected by both. Star4 is 16.74, which is not.

Option A: Star4 and 5. Star4:16.74>16, so HIRES can't. So A is out.

Option B: Star3 and 5. Star3 is 17.36, so no.

Option C: Star2 and 3. Both are above 16, so no.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star4 is 16.74, which is above 16, so no.

Wait, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let me recheck Star5.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5pc.

m_intrinsic =16.5 +5*log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897. 5 *0.69897≈3.495.

So 16.5 +3.495=19.995, minus 5 is 14.995. So m_intrinsic=15.0.

E(B-V)=0, so A_V=0. So m_observed=15.0.

So Star5 is 15.0, which is ≤16 for both. So Star5 can be seen by both.

Wait, but I thought Star1 can be seen by both (15.5 ≤16), and Star5 can be (15.0 ≤16). So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options: A) Star4 and 5, B) Star3 and 5, C) Star2 and 3, D) Star1 and 4.

None of the options mention Star1 and Star5. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I misread the options.

Wait the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, so according to my calculations, Star1 and Star5 can be seen by both. But the options don't include such a pair. Hmmm.

Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me re-examine the stars.

Wait, Star5: M=16.5, d=5pc.

m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=5 → log10(5) =0.69897.

So 5 * 0.69897 is approximately 3.495.

So m=16.5 +3.495 -5.

16.5 +3.495=19.995; 19.995 -5=14.995. So m=15.0.

So Star5 has m=15.0, observed. So it's within both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

Star1: m=15.5, which is within both.

So which stars can be detected by both? Star1 and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of the options have both Star1 and Star5.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in processing the stars.

Wait, let me check Star4.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10. So m_intrinsic=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Which is above 16, so HIRES can't detect.

Star4's m is 16.74: only ESPRESSO can.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can.

So which options include any pair where both have m ≤16.

Looking again:

Options:

A) Star4 and 5: Star4's m=16.74>16, so HIRES can't. So A is out.

B) Star3 and 5: Star3's m=17.36>17, so ESPRESSO can't. So Star3 can't be detected by either. So B is out.

C) Star2 and 3: Star2's m=16.5>16, so HIRES can't. Star3's m=17.36>17, so ESPRESSO can't. So neither can be detected by both, so C is out.

D) Star1 and 4: Star1's m=15.5, which is within both. Star4's m=16.74>16, so HIRES can't. So D is out.

Hmm, none of the options are matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for one of the stars. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me think about Star3 again. The question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, and is at 15 pc.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent V is the intrinsic (so without extinction), and the observed is higher. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, but how do I compute m_intrinsic?

Wait, m_intrinsic is the apparent magnitude without extinction. But the question says that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, with E(B-V)=0.6.

That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent V is the observed, so I can just use that. So Star3's m=15.5. Then, since E(B-V)=0.6, the extinction is 3.1 *0.6=1.86. Wait, that would make the intrinsic m_intrinsic=15.5-1.86=13.64. But why would I need that?

Wait, no, wait. The observed V is m_observed. So if the star has extinction, the observed m would be higher than the intrinsic. So if the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude is m_intrinsic, then m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

But in the case of Star3, the given apparent V is 15.5, which is the observed. So the intrinsic m is 15.5 - 3.1 * E(B-V) =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But how does that help? Because the instruments are looking at the observed magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I didn't need to adjust Star3's V. Because if the given V is observed, then it's 15.5, which is ≤16. So both can detect it. But wait, no, because the star is at 15 pc. Wait, no, no—apparent magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth, so distance doesn't matter once you have the observed m.

Wait, but wait, no. The apparent magnitude is calculated based on distance. So for a star with absolute magnitude M and distance d, the apparent magnitude without extinction is m = M +5 log10(d/10) = M +5 log10(d) -5.

If the star has extinction, then the observed m is m_observed = m + A_V.

So for Star3, does the given apparent V of 15.5 include extinction, or is it the intrinsic? Because the problem states that Star3's apparent V is 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic, and the observed is higher.

So m_intrinsic =15.5. A_V =3.1 *0.6=1.86. So observed m=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

So Star3's apparent V is 17.36, which is above both instruments: ESPRESSO can't (needs <=17), so Star3's m=17.36 is just above 17—since 17.36>17, ESPRESSO can't detect it. HIRES needs <=16, so it can't either.

So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Wait, but wait, the question says, for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5. So perhaps that's the observed. Then, the extinction is 1.86, which would make the intrinsic m=15.5-1.86=13.64. That doesn't affect our calculations because we're only concerned with the observed magnitude.

So if Star3's observed V is 15.5, then it's within both instruments' limits. But earlier I thought that Star3's observed V is 15.5 +1.86=17.36. But that would be the case if the given 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is that for Star3, the apparent V is given as 15.5, without considering extinction. So the extinction adds to it, making it 15.5 +1.86=17.36, which can't be detected by either.

But this is getting confusing. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

Star3: 'apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us.'

Ah! Wait a minute. So, in this case, the apparent V is 15.5, which is the observed magnitude, already including extinction. Because if you're giving the apparent V, that's the observed value, which includes any extinction. So in that case, Star3's m=15.5, which is within both telescopes' detection limits (<=16 for HIRES, <=17 for ESPRESSO). So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, that changes things! Because if the given apparent V is already the observed (with extinction), then Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both.

So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, which is already the observed. So no need to add extinction again. So Star3's m=15.5. So both can detect it.

Similarly, Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 +5 log10(10) -5 =15.5 +5 -5=15.5.

A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So Star4's m=16.74, which is >16. So only ESPRESSO can detect it.

So now, which stars can be detected by both?

Star1: m=15.5 → both.

Star3: m=15.5 → both.

Star5: m=15.0 → both.

Wait, this would imply that Star1,3,5 can be detected by both. But let's check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and 5 → Star4's m=16.74>16, so no.

B) Star3 and 5 → both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and3 → Star2's m=16.5>16, so only ESPRESSO can detect, but not HIRES.

D) Star1 and 4 → Star4's m=16.74>16, so no.

So option B is 'Star3 and Star5'.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both. Star5's m is 15.0, also within both. So option B is correct.

But wait, what about Star3? Because the problem says that Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is observed, so we don't need to adjust it. So Star3's m=15.5.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), Star5 (15.0).

Wait, but the options are:

A) Star4 and 5 → Star5 is ok, Star4 no.

B) Star3 and 5 → Both can.

C) Star2 and3 → Star2 can't.

D) Star1 and4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both, and Star5's m=15.0.

But wait, Star5's m=15.0 is okay, but looking back at the problem, the data for Star5 is:

Star5: RA=10h, DEC=60, absolute V=16.5, distance 5pc.

So M=16.5, d=5.

m =16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897. 5 * 0.69897≈3.495.

So 16.5 +3.495=19.995 → minus 5 is 14.995. So m≈15.0. So Star5's m=15.0, which is within both.

So Star3 (15.5) and Star5 (15.0) can be detected by both. So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Star3's m was 15.5, which is observed (so no need to add anything). So that's correct.

But wait, in the problem statement, Star3 has an apparent V of 15.5, which is the observed. So that's correct. So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, earlier I thought that Star1 can be detected by both, but option B doesn't include Star1.

Hmm, but the options are, perhaps, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the given data. Let me go back to Star3.

The problem says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc.

So the apparent V is 15.5, which is already the observed (including extinction). So m=15.5, which is within both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), Star5 (15.0).

Which of the options include any pair from these? Only option B includes Star3 and Star5.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
- **Calculation**:  
  Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
  Since there is no extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is \( m = 15.5 \).  
- **Conclusion**: Star1 has \( m = 15.5 \), which is ≤16 for both ESPRESSO and HIRES. It can be detected by both instruments.

#### **Star2**  
- **Given Data**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
- **Calculation**:  
  The apparent magnitude is already given as \( m = 16.5 \).  
- **Conclusion**: Star2 has \( m = 16.5 \), which is fainter than the HIRES limit (\( m \leq 16 \)) but within the ESPRESSO limit (\( m \leq 17 \)). It can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star3**  
- **Given Data**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), distance \( d = 15 \, \text{pc} \).  
- **Calculation**:  
  The apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \) is already the observed value, which includes extinction. No further adjustment is needed.  
- **Conclusion**: Star3 has \( m = 15.5 \), which is ≤16 for both ESPRESSO and HIRES. It can be detected by both instruments.

#### **Star4**  
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
- **Calculation**:  
  Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
  Extinction in the V band:  
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]  
  Observed apparent magnitude:  
  \[
  m = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: Star4 has \( m = 16.74 \), which is fainter than the HIRES limit (\( m \leq 16 \)) but within the ESPRESSO limit (\( m \leq 17 \)). It can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

#### **Star5**  
- **Given Data**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
- **Calculation**:  
  Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
  \[
  m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5
  \]  
  Using \( \log_{10}(5) \approx 0.69897 \):  
  \[
  m = 16.5 + 5 \cdot 0.69897 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 15.0
  \]  
  Since there is no extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is \( m = 15.0 \).  
- **Conclusion**: Star5 has \( m = 15.0 \), which is ≤16 for both ESPRESSO and HIRES. It can be detected by both instruments.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** (\( m = 15.5 \)) and **Star5** (\( m = 15.0 \)). Therefore, the correct answer is:
