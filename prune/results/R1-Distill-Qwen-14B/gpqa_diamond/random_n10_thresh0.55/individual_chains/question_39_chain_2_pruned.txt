Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, no, actually, waitâ€”no, the i is the imaginary unit, right? So the wave function is a real part plus an imaginary part. But when we measure the position of the particles, we're only finding them between x=1 and x=3. So I think that means the wave function is zero outside this region, but maybe the given wave function is just for the region where the particle exists.

Wait, the problem says that when measuring the particles, none were found at x <1 and x>3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 to x=3. But the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but if that's the case, then maybe it's a stationary state or something. Wait, but this isn't a usual form I remember. Normally, wave functions are either real or complex, but the square of the absolute value gives the probability density. Oh, right, the probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function.

Wait, but if the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, that must mean that the wave function is zero outside this interval. So the given wave function must be non-zero only between 1 and 3. So maybe that expression
