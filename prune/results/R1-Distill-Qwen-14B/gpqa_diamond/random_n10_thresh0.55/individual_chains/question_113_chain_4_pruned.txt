Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. So that suggests the compound has an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, often associated with carbonyl groups like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or possibly an aromatic ring (like conjugated carbonyl or something else). Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl stretching or maybe an amide, but since amides aren't in the options, probably not. So the presence of two carbonyls? Or maybe a carbonyl and an aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic carbonyl or perhaps an conjugated ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group in a ring, like a cyclic ester (lactone) or something like that.

Wait, but the peak at 1700 is stronger and typical of a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl (like ester or ketone), and the other is an aromatic ring (like C=C). But wait, C=C usually has peaks around 1600-1680 cm-1, so 1650 is in that range. So maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is a C=C in an aromatic ring or maybe an ester with conjugation.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on
