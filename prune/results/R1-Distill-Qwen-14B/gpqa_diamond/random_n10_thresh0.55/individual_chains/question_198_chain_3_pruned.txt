Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. There are these stability constants, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants are for the complexes, right? So each β represents the formation constant for the nth complex.

I remember that for such problems, I need to calculate the distribution of Co species in solution. The species would be the free Co²+ ion and the various complexes it forms with SCN-. The more complexes, the more the distribution shifts towards them.

The question specifically asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that's [Co(SCN)_2]²+ or maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^2−? Wait, wait, no. Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think: dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands attached. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or is it a different charge? Wait, Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1, so two would contribute -2, so the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the complexes are stepwise, like β1 is [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Wait, that's possible.

Wait, actually, the stability constants are given in order, β1 being the first step. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. So the first complex is +1 charge, the next is neutral, and so on.

The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that refers to the [
