Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B in H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can undergo hydrolysis under certain conditions. Wait, but the first reaction is between a ketone and sodium cyanide. Oh, that's probably a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones usually don't react directly with cyanide ions... Unless it's under specific conditions. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution. Or perhaps it's a cyanide acting as a nucleophile in an enolate formation?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So if it reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group. Wait, but ketones don't typically react with NaCN in the same way as aldehydes do because the carbonyl is less reactive. Or maybe it's a different mechanism. Oh, wait! Maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, that's when a nucleophile like CN- adds to a ketone in the presence of an acid catalyst. The mechanism is that the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, then CN- attacks, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin.

So, the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN with acid (H3O+) as catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile and the acid would protonate the carbonyl to make the attack possible. That would give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, for part A, the reagent must be H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I don't think fits. So maybe A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanen
