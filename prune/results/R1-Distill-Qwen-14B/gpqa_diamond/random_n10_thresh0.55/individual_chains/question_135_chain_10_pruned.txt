Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. The question gives a Lagrangian and some options about what the boson can decay into. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, what does this mean? Oh right, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson field X and a fermion field ψ_f. So the interaction term probably tells us which fermions the boson X can couple to.

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So its decay products must be fermions that have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, when a particle decays, the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the parent particle.

Looking at the options, each option lists possible decay channels. So for each decay channel, I need to check if the sum of the fermion masses is less than 6 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses I remember:

Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV
Muon (mu-): about 0.105 GeV
Tau (tau-): around 1.78 GeV
Up quark (u): very light, like 2 MeV (0.002 GeV)
Down quark (d): also light, maybe 4 MeV (0.004 GeV)
Strange (s): around 95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV
Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV
Top (t): way too heavy at around 173 GeV.

Wait, but for decay products, each fermion pair would consist of a particle and antiparticle, so for fermions like quarks, each quark is about half the mass of the pair, but wait, no, because for a quark-antiquark pair, each has mass m, so total mass is 2m. But wait, quarks are confined, so maybe we shouldn't consider their decay directly, but in pair production. But the question is about which fermions the boson can decay into; so the coupling tells us which fermions X can interact with.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term is -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Let me parse this. So this looks like a Yukawa coupling term. The general form is L = g ψ̄ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So the fermion ψ_f is interacting with the scalar X. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs of ψ_f.

So the possible decay products of X are the fermions ψ_f. So which fermions are present in the interaction?

Looking at the Lagrangian, ψ_f is the fermion field. Let me think: the fermions in the Standard Model are leptons and quarks. So the term is for each fermion species. Wait, the question doesn't specify which fermions are in
