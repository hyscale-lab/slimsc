Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. The task is to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a different value in meters.

Hmm, I remember that when particles are produced, their decay length depends on their lifetime and their velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime, multiplied by the velocity. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps.

First, I think I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, no, actually, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, but since Γ is the width, which has units of energy, and τ would have units of time. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, but ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So I should compute τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me think: ħ has units of GeV·seconds or something like that. Because 1 GeV is a unit of energy, and Planck's constant times energy would give inverse time. Wait, no, ħ has units of J·s, but let's get the exact value.

Wait, ħ is
