Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the larger the wobble, right?

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a Neptune-mass planet. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data here are the periodic shifts in their spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )^(something) ??? Maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is K = ( ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ), but that
