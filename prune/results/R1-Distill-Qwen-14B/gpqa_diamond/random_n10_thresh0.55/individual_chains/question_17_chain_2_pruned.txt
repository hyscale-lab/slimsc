Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I remember that EDTA is a ligand that forms complexes with metal ions. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is very stable.

Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Right, because the Ca-EDTA complex is formed, so the free Ca²+ concentration would be low.

I think the formula for the formation of a complex is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- <-> CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is given, but wait, sometimes K is given as the dissociation constant. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, K here is the stability constant, Kf, which is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But the question gives KCa-EDTA as 5e10. So Kf is 5x10^10.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so let's call that [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that the solution is ideal, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. But to find [Ca²+], I need to consider the dissociation.

So the equation would be:

Kf = [CaEDTA²-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, when the complex dissociates, each molecule releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So at equilibrium, [CaEDTA²-] ≈ 0.02 M, assuming that the dissociation is minimal because Kf is so large.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because if the complex is stable, most of the Ca is tied up in the complex, so the free [Ca²+] would be very low.

Let me set up the variables:

Let’s say the concentration of the complex is C = 0.02 M.

When it dissociates, each complex gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-. So, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ (and EDTA^4-) formed from dissociation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial concentration of the
