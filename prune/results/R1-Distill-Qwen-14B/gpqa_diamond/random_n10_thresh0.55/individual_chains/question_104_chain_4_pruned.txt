Okay, so I need to figure out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my exoplanet detection methods, but I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method is about the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet orbits. So, the star moves back and forth, and we measure that shift in the spectral lines.

Wait, the question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun. Oh, but wait, the problem says "exactly the same masses". So, both stars have the same mass, which is solar mass. That's important because the mass of the star affects the orbit. 

Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So same planet mass. But the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. Or wait, what's the formula again? I think the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and the star's mass. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (2π) * (1/( (M_* )^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(-1/3) )) ) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the more simplified version since the eccentricity is zero here because the orbits are circular. So e is zero, so that term is 1.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude K to the orbital period and other variables. Alternatively, I think there's a relation that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_* )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) or something like that. Let me think again. The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude as K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) + M_p^(2/3) ) ). But in cases where M_p << M_*, which is true here because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun, that term simplifies. Because M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_*^2/3 dominates. So K ≈ ( (G * (M_p) sin i) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π c)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should look for a proportionality.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula for the semi-amplitude K. The formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π c)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)))

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2π c)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)))

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV semi
