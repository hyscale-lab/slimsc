Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me think carefully. 

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when we talk about excitation levels, we're probably referring to the population of higher energy states relative to lower ones. So, the excitation here is about the ratio of atoms in a particular energy level to another. 

Wait, the question mentions the energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, but wait, I think the formula for the excitation depends on the relation between the populations of two energy levels. I remember the Boltzmann equation, which relates the relative populations of two energy states in thermal equilibrium. 

The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of the populations (n_upper / n_lower) is equal to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. 

In this case, star_1 has twice as excited, so n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2. For star_2, it's n_upper2 / n_lower2. Wait, but the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Oh wait, no. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in
