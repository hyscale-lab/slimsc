Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one that's more likely to transit, which would mean a higher probability. They've already detected these via the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Both planets have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3.

Their orbits are circular, which probably simplifies things a bit. The host stars have different masses but same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit odd because usually more massive stars are larger, but maybe Planet_2's star is a subgiant or something evolved but hasn't expanded yet, so same radius but higher mass.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. From what I remember, the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us, which is a geometric probability. Oh, and the formula for the probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / a, but I might be mixing that up. Wait, no, the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis (distance from star) multiplied by some other factors, but I think the key is the distance and the star's size.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by some function of the orbital inclination. But since the RV method detects planets with high confidence, especially for closer-in planets, maybe the orbital inclination is already considered? Or wait, transit probability is a geometric factor. So the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it passes in front of the star from our point of view.

The formula for transit probability is (R_star / a) * (something), but I think more accurately, the probability is approximately (R_star / a), considering that the planet's orbit must be edge-on. But wait, actually, the transit probability is approximately (R_*/ a) * (1/(1
