Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given data includes the concentration of the complex, the formation constant (KCa-EDTA), and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I think this is the concentration of the complex formed, [CaEDTA²⁻]. Wait, but wait, let me think. The solution has stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

I remember the formula for the formation constant K. The formation constant (Kf) is given by the equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here. EDTA is usually in the form Y^4-. So when it complexes with Ca²+, the formula would be CaY²⁻, I think. So the complex is CaY²⁻.

So the equation would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²⁻. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10.

But wait, the problem gives the K as KCa-EDTA, which I think is the same as Kf, the formation constant.

So the initial setup is that [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca²+].

But wait, the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions, right? Because in the solution, some of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, but we're looking for the free [Ca²+].

Wait no, wait. Wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps all of the Ca is in the complex, and the EDTA is in excess? Or is that not the case?

Wait, no. Wait, when you have a complex formation, you can have some dissociation. So
