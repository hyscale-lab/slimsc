Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions and I need to select the appropriate reagents (A and B) from the given options. Let me write down what's happening in each reaction.

First Reaction:
Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile

Second Reaction:
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

Hmm, okay. Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So, what kind of reaction is this? It looks like an addition reaction. Maybe a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

In the product, we have 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would probably lead to the formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a ketone reacts with CN- to form a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

So the general reaction is: ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But wait, the conditions for this? I think the formation of a cyanohydrin typically involves a strong acid catalyst. Because CN- is a weak nucleophile, so it needs some activation.

In the reaction, A is the reagent used. The options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, like H+ from HCl or H2SO4. Alternatively, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3^- and H+.

Wait, but when forming a cyanohydrin, the mechanism usually involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon. To make the carbonyl more electrophilic, an acid catalyst is used. So the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more positive, facilitating nucleophilic attack.

So for the first reaction, A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, the choices for A are H3O+ (which is
