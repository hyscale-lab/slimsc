Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal, which is different from a cubic system where the angles can vary. So in this case, the interatomic distance (which I think is the lattice parameter 'a') is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance formula. Oh right, the interplanar distance 'd' for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos(beta) + hl cos(gamma) + kl cos(alpha)) )

Wait, no, wait. I think I might be mixing it with another formula. Alternatively, I remember that for cubic systems, it's simpler because cos terms might be zero or something, but here it's a rhombohedral which has all angles the same.

Wait, another approach: I think the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameter 'a' and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

d^2 = (a^2)(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha)) / ( (h + k + l)^2 )

Wait, no, maybe that's for something else. Alternatively, I've
