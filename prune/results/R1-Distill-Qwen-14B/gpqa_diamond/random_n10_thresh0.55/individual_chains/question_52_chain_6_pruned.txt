Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Observations show that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—without spots compared to with spots.

Hmm, I remember that under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, and E is the energy.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots. That means that the denominator (n2) is getting bigger, or the numerator (n1) is getting smaller. So when spots are present, the temperature is lower, right? Because spots are cooler regions.

Wait, but the effective temperature of the entire star's photosphere is lower when the spots are present. So when the star has spots, the effective Teff is 5500 K, compared to 6000 K when it's spot-free. So the average T is lower.

But wait, no—the star's surface is 40% covered by spots. The spots are probably cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the overall effective temperature is lower, but the photosphere's actual temperature might vary. But the question says the photospheric Teff decreases, so I should probably model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but in reality, the spots are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K. But the question states that when the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff is
