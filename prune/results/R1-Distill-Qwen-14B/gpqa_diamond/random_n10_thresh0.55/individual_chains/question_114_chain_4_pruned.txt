Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involve some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but NaCN is a source of cyanide ions, right?

Oh wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide nucleophile, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I think I'm confusing this with something else. Oh yeah, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh right, the acid helps protonate the carbonyl, making it a better electrophile.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) is reacting with NaCN and reagent A. If A is an acid like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid, maybe), then that would protonate the ketone. The cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen would get a proton, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That fits with the product given: 2-hydroxy-2-methyl
