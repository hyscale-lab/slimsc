Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The options are A to D.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass is what we're being asked about. Normally, when light travels through a medium with index of refraction n, its speed is c/n, right? Because in vacuum, it's c, so in the medium, it's slower.

But here, the glass itself is moving. So the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab isn't just the usual c/n. Why? Because the medium is moving, so we have to consider the motion of the medium affecting the observed speed.

Wait, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula comes into play. Oh right, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, u is the velocity of the light in the medium as seen from the medium's frame, and v is the velocity of the medium relative to the lab.

Wait, but in this case, the light is moving through the glass, which is moving. So from the lab's frame, the light's speed might be different.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, same direction? Or toward the observer. Wait, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So both are moving toward the observer, so the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, no. Let me think: the glass is moving toward the observer in the lab, and the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, the beam is moving toward the observer, same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, the beam is going through the glass which is moving. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at v, and within the glass, light is moving at c/n. So what's the total speed?

Wait, I might need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here. Because the glass is a moving medium, and light's speed in that medium (from the glass's frame) is c/n. So from the lab's frame, the speed of light would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the speed in the glass's frame.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. So u = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So the lab frame sees the light's speed as u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²).

But wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer. So the direction is important here. Since light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, the velocities add. So u is the speed in the glass frame (c/n) and v is the speed of the glass relative to lab.

Wait, but the formula says you add them with the denominator. So let's plug in u = c/n. Since c=1, u = 1/n.

So u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Wait, that's the same as (1 + n v) / (n + v ) when we multiply numerator and denominator by n.

Wait, because (1/n + v) is same as (1 + n v)/n. And denominator is 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n. So when you divide those fractions, it's (1 +n v)/(n + v) * [n/(n + v)]? Wait no, wait:

Wait, let's compute denominator:

Denominator is 1 + (u v)/c². Since u is c/n and c=1, (u v) becomes (v)/(n). So denominator is 1 + v/(n) = (n + v)/n.

So u' = ( (1/n + v) ) / ( (n + v)/n ) )

Which is [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n +v)/n ] = (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Wait, so that's (1 + n v)/(n + v) as the speed of light in the lab frame.

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). Option B is 1 (which can't be right because light slows down in glass normally; but considering motion, maybe? No, because when the medium is moving, the speed would vary).

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, the problem asks for the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. Wait, no, the speed of light in the glass is c/n. But when the glass is moving, the observed speed could be different because of the medium's motion.

But according to the calculation, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's option A.

Wait, but another thought: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So the light is emitted from the moving glass. So according to the lab frame, the light's speed is as per the velocity addition formula.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must account for the motion of the glass medium and the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), so the speed of light within the glass, as observed in the glass's rest frame, is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \). Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to \( u = \frac{1}{n} \). The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

we substitute \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \). This gives:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the numerator and denominator by multiplying through by \( n \), we obtain:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**.
