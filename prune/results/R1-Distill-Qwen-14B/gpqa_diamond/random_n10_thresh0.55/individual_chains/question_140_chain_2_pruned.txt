Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. 

Hmm, I remember that 277 K is around 4 degrees Celsius. What substances melt near that temperature? Maybe something like ice, but ice melts at 273 K. Wait, but 277 is a bit higher. Maybe something else. Oh, maybe it's a solid that's a bit higher? Or perhaps I'm thinking of something else entirely. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid with a higher melting point. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium chloride, but no, that's way higher. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, maybe B is something that's solid at that temperature but perhaps a different state? Not sure, I'll come back to that.

The product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and substance X has 2 oxygen atoms. Oh, wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. They often have two oxygen atoms in their structure. Maybe the product is something like a salt with two oxygens, like maybe a carbonate or something else. Not sure yet.

Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Also, a very close analog is used as a reagent. So, what reagents are known for having isotopes? Maybe something like D2O (deuterated water) instead of H2O. Or maybe it's something else. Wait, if X is incorporating a heavier isotope, perhaps it's deuterated. For example, if X is sodium deuteroborohydride or something like that. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Let me think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, so perhaps it's a strong acid reacting with something. Or maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Let's think about the gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So if W is a molecule, maybe it's a diatomic molecule. Let's think about possible gases.

For example, if W is H2O, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each molecule would have 1 (from H) and 8 (from O) protons, and 0+8=8 neutrons. But wait, each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. So total protons: 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 2*0 + 8 = 8. But that doesn't match. So W's molecule must have equal protons and neutrons in total.

Another possibility: CO2. Each CO2 molecule has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and O (8 each). So total protons:6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons:6 + 2*8=22. Oh, that matches! So W
