Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step. 

The question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is a 2x2 matrix given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. Oh right! The Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons. Spin operators are usually proportional to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, but I need to check that.

So, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is indeed [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, the matrix S given here is exactly σy. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches σy. 

Now, the operator Ay is c times S, so Ay = c * σy. The constant c is h/(4π). Let me compute c: h is Planck's constant, and I remember that ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π). So c = h/(4π) equals ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2.

So, Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. Because σy is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are ±1, right? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, for the spin operators, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) * σ. So the eigenvalues of σ are ±1, so the eigenvalues of S would be ± ħ/2.

Wait, let's think again. The operator Ay is (ħ/2) * σy, so when we find the eigenvalues, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2) * (±1), so ± ħ/2. 

But wait, the question mentions that a is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues are a = ± (ħ/2). 

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ± h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues should be real. Because the spin operator is Hermitian. Oh wait, wait wait. Wait a minute, wait. Ay is an angular momentum component, which should be Hermitian since it's an observable. So its eigenvalues should be real. 

Wait, but wait. Wait, the matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is (ħ/2) * σy. Let me compute ħ in terms of h. ħ = h/(2π), so c = ħ/2 = h/(4π). So that's correct.

But wait, the matrix [[0, -i],[i, 0
