Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the problem is about a star whose properties change when dark spots cover part of its surface. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main thing we're looking at is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it's spotted.

Hmm, right. So the key here is about the ratio of populations in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of the two levels,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is the Boltzmann constant,
- T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So the spots cause the average temperature to drop. But how does that affect the ratio?

Wait, the ratio is n2/n1. When the temperature is lower, the exponential term would be smaller because (E2-E1)/(k*T) increases. So exp(-x) becomes smaller as x increases. So n2/n1 would decrease if E2 > E1 because the exponent becomes more negative. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so n2/n1 is lower. So the ratio without spots (higher T) would be higher than when there are spots.

But wait, the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots divided
