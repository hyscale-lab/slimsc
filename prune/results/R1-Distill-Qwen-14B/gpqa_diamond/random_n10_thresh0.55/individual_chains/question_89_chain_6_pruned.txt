Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. Oh wait, KOH is a strong base. I think this might be a dehydrohalogenation reaction, like an E2 elimination. But wait, with two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination. Or perhaps it's a di-elimination, leading to forming a double bond or something. Alternatively, considering that the product is a light yellow solid, maybe it's a ketone. Because when you eliminate two bromides, perhaps two H's are abstracted, leading to a double bond, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, KOH could be causing a substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Wait, the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product 1 has a ketone group. So maybe the elimination leads to forming a ketone? Wait, how? Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, but how would that form a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. If the structure
