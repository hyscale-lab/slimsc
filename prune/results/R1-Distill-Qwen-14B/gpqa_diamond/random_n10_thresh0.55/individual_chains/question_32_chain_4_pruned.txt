Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. I need to find the energy of RHIC in GeV. The options are given as A to D.

First, I should probably identify what nucleus X is. The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium-7 isotope has 3 neutrons, right? So lithium-7 would be X. Let me confirm: lithium has atomic number 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, that's 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it lithium-7 (7 being 3+3+1? Wait, no, waitâ€”no, atomic number is protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no: Li has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 +3 =6. So it's lithium-6? Or maybe wait, lithium usually has isotopes. Oh, wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So number of protons is 3, neutrons 3, so mass number is 3+3=6. So it's ^6Li. So the nucleus is a lithium-
