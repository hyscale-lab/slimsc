Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance—parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, right, the formula I remember is distance in parsecs equals 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d. So as distance d increases, plx decreases.

The question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance. So the number of stars is a function of parallax, and we need to relate that to distance.

The given relation is number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that.

1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me see.

Hmm. Or does it mean the number of stars per unit distance? Because the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So maybe it's the density or the rate of change.

Wait, the number of
