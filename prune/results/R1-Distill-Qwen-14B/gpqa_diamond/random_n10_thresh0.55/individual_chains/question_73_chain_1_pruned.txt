Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving different values.

First, relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like in classical mechanics. I remember there's the velocity addition formula. Let me recall. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/cÂ²), where u and v are the speeds of the two objects relative to the same frame. Wait, but which one is moving in which frame? Since both are moving in the same direction, we'll subtract.

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So, the relative speed should be how much faster the first is moving compared to the second. So, from the second astronaut's frame, the first is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by something. But wait, no, I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Oh wait, no. The formula is for when you have two frames, S and S', moving at speed v relative to S. So, if in frame S, object A is moving at u (0.6c) and object B
