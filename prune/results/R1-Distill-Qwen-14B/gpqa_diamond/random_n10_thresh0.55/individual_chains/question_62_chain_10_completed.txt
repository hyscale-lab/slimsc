Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. At position 1, there's a group attached: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, that would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. Also, the cyclohexane has a carbonyl group, specifically a carbaldehyde — so a CHO group attached to it. Wait, no, the name says cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane. So, the main ring is cyclohexane, with an aldehyde group at position 1 and another substituent, which is a hydroxymethyl attached to a cyclohexyl group at the same position? Or maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the IUPAC name: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent at position 1 is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring where position 1 has both an aldehyde group and a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached. Wait, that's not possible unless it's a branching point. Wait, maybe the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is also at position 1. So, the molecule is:

Cyclohexane ring
Position 1: has an aldehyde group (CHO) and a CH2 group that's connected to both a hydroxyl (OH) and a cyclohexyl group.

So, structure-wise, it's like cyclohexane with a CHO at C1, and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group also attached to C1. Wait, but the way it's named suggests that the substituent is a methyl group (CH2-) with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl on it. So, maybe it's a branch: C1 has a CH2 connected to both OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond attached to the ring). So, the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached.

So, we need to go from ethynylcyclohexane to that target molecule. Let me outline the possible steps.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about possible functional group transformations. The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. Hmm. So, the aldehyde suggests some oxidation. The hydroxymethyl group on a cyclohexane suggests some kind of addition or substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group can be functionalized. Let me think about each option. The options involve various reagents.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps include NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, etc. I'm not sure.

Option B: Steps include NaNH2, ethyl chloride, then Li/lq NH3, O3/H2O, NH4OH.

Option C: Steps include NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, O3/(CH3)2S, Ba(OH)2.

Option D: Steps include NaNH2, methanol, Li/lq NH3, O3/(CH3)2S, NH4OH.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about each step.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group.

We need to get an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Hmm. One approach could be to perform a hydroboration or some addition to the triple bond. Alternatively, perhaps adding a functional group and then modifying it.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond can be used to form a ketone or aldehyde via some oxidation. But aldehydes are typically formed from oxidation of primary alcohols, and ketones from secondary alcohols.

Alternatively, the triple bond can be converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. So, that's a propargyl group. To convert a propargyl group into a carbonyl, perhaps via a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the triple bond can be oxidized. Oxidation of a propargyl group (CH2-C≡CH) could lead to a ketone or aldehyde. Let's think: an aldehyde is a primary carbonyl group. So, if we oxidize the triple bond, perhaps that's the way.

Another approach is to perform a hydration of the triple bond. For example, using H2O and a catalyst to add water across the triple bond, forming a carbonyl group. Wait, propargyl alcohol is CH2-C≡C-CH2-OH, but that's not directly applicable here. Hmm.

Alternatively, the triple bond can undergo deprotonation to form a strong base, which could react with an electrophilic reagent. For example, NaNH2 (a strong base) can deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, since the triple bond makes the alpha hydrogen acidic. Deprotonation would give a cyclohexane ring with a CH-C≡CH group, which is a strong base.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base and often used for deprotonating. So, if we have ethynylcyclohexane, and we treat it with NaNH2, it would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen (the hydrogen on the CH2 adjacent to the triple bond) to form a cyclohexyl cyclopropylide or something similar? Or wait, the structure is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, the alpha hydrogen is on the CH2. When deprotonated, it would form a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH-C≡CH^- and then NH2^-.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the ethynyl group to form an alkyne anion, which can then undergo alkylation. For example, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) as an alkylating agent. So, if the alkyne is deprotonated to form a strong base (like a cyclohexyl acetylide), then treated with methyl chloride, we would get an alkylation. So, the triple bond would have a methyl group added to it.

Wait, the product of alkyne deprotonation and alkylation would give a longer alkyne. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Ethylnylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH. Deprotonating would give CH^- - C≡CH, and then adding an alkylating agent like methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would give CH(CH3)-C≡CH, attached to the cyclohexane. So, the product would be a 1-methylprop-1-ynylcyclohexane? Or maybe (cyclohexyl)ethylmethylacetylene? Not entirely sure, but let's suppose that step 1 adds a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, but wait, the order of reagents in each option is different. Let me look at all options again.

Option A: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, that would deprotonate the alkyne and methylate it, adding a methyl group. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, hydrogenation of the triple bond would give a single bond, but what? Hydrogenation of an alkyne typically gives an alkane. Wait, but the catalyst might matter. Pd is used for hydrogenation, but sometimes Lindlar's catalyst is used for partial hydrogenation to cis alkenes. Wait, but without a catalyst like Lindlar, H2 and Pd would probably hydrogenate the triple bond all the way to a single bond. So, if the alkyne becomes CH2CH2—? Wait, no. Wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Adding H2 with Pd would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, turning into CH2-CH2-CH2? No. Wait, no. Let me correct: the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Adding hydrogen would make it CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the triple bond (C≡C) would be hydrogenated to a single bond (C-C), but the number of carbons remains the same. So, the triple bond CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think: the structure is CH2-C≡CH. When hydrogenated, each triple bond (two pi bonds) would take four hydrogens to become a single bond. So, CH2-C≡CH + 2 H2 → CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right, because that would imply three CH2 groups in a row. Wait, no; the triple bond is between two carbons. So, the structure is CH2-C≡C-H. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-H? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The triple bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (if the cyclohexane is carbon 1). So, after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's impossible because it needs to connect correctly.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation would convert CH2-C≡CH into CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would require the triple bond to become a single bond with two more carbons. Oh wait, no. Let me think: the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be; perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2, but that would be propane. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Adding hydrogen across the triple bond would make the single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's three carbons in a row, but the original is two. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's think more clearly. The alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. So, it's prop-1-ynyl group attached to cyclohexane. When hydrogenated, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's three carbons. Wait, no, because the triple bond is between the two central carbons, so when hydrogenated, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2? No, I'm confused. Let me think of it as CH2-C≡CH → CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, wait. Propyne (CH3-C≡CH) would become propane upon hydrogenation. So, CH3-CH2-CH3. But our case is CH2-C≡CH. So, hydrogenation would make CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait, that makes sense. So, CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the product after hydrogenation would be cyclohexane with a CH2-CH2-CH3 group attached. Wait, no, no, that's not right. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane connected to CH2-C≡CH. So, after hydrogenation, it would become cyclohexane connected to CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be, because that would make a three-carbon chain, but the starting material only had two carbons (the ethynyl group is two carbons: CH2-C≡CH). So, when hydrogenated, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2 attached to cyclohexane? No, that would imply three carbons, which doesn't make sense because the starting alkyne was two carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The correct product when hydrogenating CH2-C≡CH is CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't seem right because the alkyne is two carbons. Wait, perhaps the alkyne is between two CH2 groups. Let me think of it as CH2-C≡C-CH2? No, no, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, meaning the cyclohexane is attached to one end of the alkyne. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, when hydrogenated, the triple bond becomes a single bond, and the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2. But that would be cyclohexane with a propyl group attached. Wait, no, that's not correct because the triple bond is between the two carbons. So, the hydrogenation would add two H's across each triple bond. Wait, perhaps I should think of the alkyne as: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. When hydrogenated, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2. But wait, that would be a three-carbon chain, but where is the extra carbon coming from? Oh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: the ethynyl group is -C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. When hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, that can't be right because that's three carbons, but the starting material has two. Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation adds two H's per triple bond. So, each triple bond has two pi bonds, so adding two H's per bond. So, for the triple bond (two pi bonds), adding four H's would convert it into a single bond. So, the alkyne CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-CH2-CH2. But that would be a three-carbon chain, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of the hydrogenation as converting the alkyne into an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, and the number of carbons remains the same. So, CH2-C≡CH becomes CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's three carbons, but the starting alkyne has two carbons. Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Upon hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so it's cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. Ah, wait, that makes sense. So, the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. After hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so it's CH2-CH2-CH3, making the substituent a propyl group. So, the product would be cyclohexane with a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) attached. But wait, that doesn't seem to align with the target molecule, which has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer alkyne, then hydrogenation to a different structure. Let's think about the options again.

Looking at option C: the steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, so after alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and then treatment with Ba(OH)2.

Wait, let me think about each step.

First step: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then methyl chloride would methylate it. So, the product would be cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡C-Me group. Then, step 2 is H2 with Pd. So, hydrogenation would reduce the triple bond to a single bond, making it CH2-CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, no, perhaps the triple bond is between two CH2 groups? Let me think: the initial structure after alkylation would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenation would make it cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, a four-carbon chain? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkylation adds a methyl group to one end of the triple bond, making it CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me (but I'm not certain). Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is adding a methyl to the acetylide, so the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me. Wait, no, the acetylide is CH2-C≡C^-. Adding methyl chloride would give CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me? Or perhaps CH2-C≡C-CH3. Hmm, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the sp-hybridized carbon. So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 is H2/Pd. So, hydrogenation of the triple bond would convert it to a single bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, a four-carbon chain. Then, step 3 is O3 in (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double or triple bonds. If the hydrogenation was to a single bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe the hydrogenation doesn't go all the way to a single bond. Wait, when you hydrogenate an alkyne with H2 and Pd, it typically goes all the way to a single bond. So, maybe in this case, after alkylation, hydrogenation yields a longer alkane chain.

But if the next step is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond, maybe the hydrogenation step is not complete. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step where the alkene is formed.

Wait, another approach: perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with another substituent, then hydrogenated to form a double bond via partial hydrogenation. But then, the hydrogenation condition matters. Pd typically fully hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds, but if the catalyst is different, perhaps it stops at the alkene. Wait, but in the options, option C's second step is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a typical full hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider other reagents. Let me think about each option.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2 and methanol, then Li/liquid NH3, then O3/(CH3)2S, then NH4OH.

Hmm, NaNH2 and methanol. So, perhaps deprotonation followed by some reaction with methanol. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base; perhaps it deprotonates the ethynyl group, and then reacts with methanol. But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it's an alkyne alkylation, but with methanol as the alkylating agent? Not sure. Or perhaps it's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonation to form the acetylide, which then reacts with an electrophile. Methanol is a polar aprotic solvent, but perhaps it's not an electrophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration reaction. Wait, NaNH2 in methanol might deprotonate the ethynyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a substitution. If the acetylide is treated with an alkyl halide, but in option D, the first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Grignard-like reaction. But NaNH2 is a strong base, it's often used in deprotonation to form acetylides.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the target's functional groups and see how they can be formed.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring. Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, that's a secondary alcohol attached to a cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then performing some kind of addition, like a Grignard or hydroboration, followed by oxidation or reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, and then some kind of alkylation occurs.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. Let's think about that. Oxidizing ethynylcyclohexane to a ketone or aldehyde.

Oxidation of ethynyl groups can lead to different products. For example, using O3 (ozone) would cleave the triple bond, but that's more for ozonolysis. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions could convert the alkyne into a carboxylic acid or ketone, depending on the structure.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-ethynyl) would, upon oxidation, perhaps form cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid or a ketone. Let me think: the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. If oxidized, the triple bond could become a carbonyl group, so the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-CO-OH (a carboxylic acid) or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's cyclohexane-CH2-CO-OH (benzaldehyde derivative? No, wait, benzaldehyde is Ar-CHO. So, perhaps the alkyne becomes a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. For that, a possible method is ozonolysis followed by reductive workup.

Wait, ozonolysis of an alkyne typically gives a diketone. But ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to the ring. Ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(=O)-C(=O)-H? Or maybe cyclohexane-CH2-C(=O)-CO2H? I'm a bit unclear on that.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use O3 followed by a reductive workup, like with Zn/H2O. That would prevent the formation of carboxylic acids and instead give aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, if I ozonolyse ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH), the ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyls. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-O=C=O? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, the product would be two aldehyde groups. So, each end would become a carbonyl. So, the alkyne CH2-C≡CH would become OHC-CH2-CHO after ozonolysis and reductive workup (like with (CH3)2S). Wait, but that would require the alkyne to be in a chain, not attached to a cyclohexane. Hmm. So, the ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyls. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-O=C=O, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it would form cyclohexane-CH(OH)CHO? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps this substituent is formed via some kind of addition reaction to a carbonyl group.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group, then undergoes a Grignard addition, forming an alcohol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group again. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to form a trans-alkene, then undergoes hydration to form a ketone. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the sequence involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, then hydrogenating it to form a propyl group, then performing some kind of oxidation or cleavage to form a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to form a propargyl alcohol, then perform some oxidation or addition.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another angle: looking at the options and seeing which sequence makes sense.

Option D's steps are:

1. NaNH2 and methanol
2. Li/liquid NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

So, step 1: NaNH2 in methanol. Maybe deprotonating the alkyne to form the acetylide, then reacting with methanol. But I'm not sure what that would do. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but I don't see a leaving group. Maybe it's more about deprotonation and then something else.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a typical condition for Birch reductions or for forming Grignard-like reagents. Alternatively, it's used for deprotonating arenes to form cyclohexyl lithium, but in this case, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 in methanol could deprotonate the ethynyl group to form the acetylide, which could then react with an electrophile. But in this case, methanol is a solvent, not an electrophile. Maybe the acetylide doesn't react further in this step, so perhaps this step doesn't do anything. That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming the acetylide, and step 2 is a deprotonation with Li in liquid NH3, which is a stronger base. But I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis followed by reductive workup, which typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, if the molecule has a double bond after step 2, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH. That's a source of ammonium ions, perhaps used in workup or as a catalyst.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide.

2. React with something to form an alkene.

Wait, but looking at the steps in option D, after NaNH2 and methanol, and then Li/liquid NH3, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination to form an alkene. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is deprotonation, step 2 is a lithium amide reaction, leading to some functionalization. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence involves converting the alkyne to a carbonyl, then forming a Grignard reagent, then adding it to another carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting sidetracked. Let me think about each option and see which one makes sense.

Looking for the target molecule, which has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Let me think about the steps needed to get there.

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane).

2. Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group. Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond into two carbonyl groups, but that would require the alkyne to be in a chain, which it isn't. Alternatively, perhaps using a different method to form a carbonyl.

3. Once a carbonyl is formed, perhaps perform some kind of addition to form the hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the hydroxymethyl. So, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is introduced via a ring-opening or some alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone via oxidation, then doing a Grignard addition to form an alcohol, which can then be oxidized to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, which can then undergo some kind of addition or oxidation.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me try to look at option C again.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the acetylide, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me attached to the cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkane. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond. The structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to the cyclohexane.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But wait, the molecule now has no double or triple bonds, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation, adding an ethyl group to the alkyne.

So, the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Et attached to cyclohexane.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → perhaps a deprotonation or elimination reaction. Maybe this forms an alkene via deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, if after alkylation, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH2-Et, then treating with a strong base like Li in NH3 might lead to elimination, forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it forms a trans-alkene. I'm not sure.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis, which would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps hydrolysis.

So, perhaps after ozonolysis, the molecule is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. Then, in step 4, NH4OH might cause some kind of rearrangement or addition.

But I'm not certain.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, adding methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenation of alkyne to single bond, making a longer alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps an elimination reaction, forming a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration or some kind of hydration.

Wait, but step 4 seems like oxymercuration conditions. Oxymercuration typically adds an OH group to the less substituted side of a double bond.

But I'm not sure how this would form the target structure.

Hmm, this is taking a while, but I'll try to think through each option carefully.

Let me consider the target molecule again: it's a cyclohexane with a substituent that includes an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde group comes from oxidizing a primary alcohol. So, maybe one part of the molecule is oxidized, and another part is added via Grignard or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then performing a Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group directly attached to the cyclohexane, so perhaps that's formed via oxidation.

Another idea: perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, then some kind of nucleophilic addition occurs, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about option D again.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → deprotonation to form acetylide.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → maybe deprotonate further or perform some elimination.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would cleave any double bonds into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But after step 1, we have the acetylide. Then, step 2 with Li and NH3 is unclear. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 forms the acetylide, which in step 2 undergoes an elimination reaction, forming a trans-alkene. Then, ozonolysis in step 3 would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Hmm. Perhaps another approach is needed. I'll think about each step's purpose.

The target has an aldehyde group and a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group.

Perhaps the synthesis is as follows:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a ketone.

But how? One method is to use O3 followed by reductive workup, but that would require a triple bond. Alternatively, using KMnO4 under acidic conditions could oxidize the alkyne to a carboxylic acid, but that doesn't fit the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then hydroboration adds across the double bond to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But the target has an aldehyde, not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a trans-alkene, then subjected to hydration to form a ketone. But again, the target has an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then treated with a strong oxidizing agent to form a ketone. But I'm not certain.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. The correct sequence must form both the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl groups correctly.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → acetylide + methyl group addition.

Result: ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane.

Now the substituent is a butyl group (CH2CH2CH2Me). Wait, no, that's three carbons: CH2-CH2-CH2-Me, which would be a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But the molecule has no double bonds, so this wouldn't do anything. So, option C's step 3 is unclear.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. If after step 2, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-Me, which is a propyl group, then ozonolysis wouldn't work. So option C's step 3 is incorrect, making option C unlikely.

Option D: Steps 1 and 2 are NaNH2/methanol and Li/liquid NH3. Not sure what that does.

Option B: Steps 1 and 2 are NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, then Li/liquid NH3. Then ozonolysis and NH4OH.

Hmm. Let me think about the steps in option B.

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride → alkylation of the acetylide, adding an ethyl group. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Et attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: Li/liquid NH3 → perhaps elimination to form a trans-alkene. So, the triple bond becomes a double bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH2-Et → CH2-CH2-CH2-Et with a double bond. Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation leading to the formation of a double bond via elimination. So, the product would have a double bond between the two central carbons.

Then, step 3: O3/H2O → ozonolysis of the double bond, which would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So, the substituent would split into two parts, each with a carbonyl group.

Step 4: NH4OH → hydrolysis, perhaps forming aldehydes or ketones.

But I'm not sure how that would lead to the target molecule, which has a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2 and methyl chloride, then H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So, after step 1: acetylide methylated → CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me attached.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenated to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

Then step 3: Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form a ketone or some other functional group.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions. So, perhaps step 3 is an E2 elimination, forming a double bond.

Then, step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → oxymercuration conditions, which would add an -OH group to the less substituted side of a double bond.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make a best guess based on the options.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl is formed via a Grignard or hydroboration addition to a carbonyl group.

If the correct sequence involves forming a carbonyl group first, then adding a Grignard reagent to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then a Grignard reagent is added to form a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate alkyne to form acetylide.

2. Alkylate to add a methyl group.

3. Hydrogenate to form a trans-alkene.

4. Perform ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

5. Perform a workup to form the necessary functional groups.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Let me think again about option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, so CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. Now, the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but there are no double bonds, so this wouldn't do anything. So, perhaps option C is incorrect.

Hmm.

Another angle: The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

a. Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde).

b. Perform a Grignard addition to form a secondary alcohol.

c. Oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has both an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol group.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the secondary alcohol comes from another part.

Hmm. Still not clear.

I'm going to go with option D, perhaps. Let me think:

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → acetylide.

2. Li/liquid NH3 → maybe forms a lithium acetylide, which reacts further.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation to form a cyclohexyl lithium, which can then perform a coupling reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would cleave any double bonds.

Step 4: NH4OH → hydrolysis.

Hmm. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps that's formed via a nucleophilic substitution or addition after forming a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne to a carbonyl group (like a ketone).

2. Perform a Grignard addition to form an alcohol.

3. Oxidize the alcohol to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure how that fits into the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then subjected to oxidation to form a ketone, followed by addition of a Grignard reagent.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and not fully resolving it, I think I have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, option C seems to involve alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and Ba(OH)2. But without seeing how that forms the target, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule has a longer chain, which upon ozonolysis forms a carbonyl group. Then, Ba(OH)2 could induce some kind of elimination or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C.

After considering all possibilities, I'm going to go with option C as the correct answer.


The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group at the same position. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, resulting in a methyl-substituted alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkane chain.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxymercuration conditions, typically used to add an -OH group to a double bond.

However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the target molecule’s hydroxymethyl group and aldehyde group are formed. This option seems incomplete.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with ethyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, resulting in an ethyl-substituted alkyne.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely used for elimination, forming a double bond from the alkyne.
3. **O₃/ H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Hydrolyzes the ozonolysis products.

While this sequence involves functionalization and cleavage, it does not clearly lead to the formation of the cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde group in the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide, resulting in a methyl-substituted alkyne.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer alkane chain.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but the molecule no longer has a double bond after hydrogenation, making this step unclear.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or oxidation.

The sequence is inconsistent because ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after hydrogenation. This makes the sequence incomplete or incorrect.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, but the role of methanol is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely used for elimination or deprotonation, but the exact transformation is uncertain.
3. **O₃/ (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but the molecule no longer has a double bond after the previous steps, making this step unclear.
4. **NH₄OH**: Hydrolyzes the ozonolysis products.

The sequence is ambiguous, and the steps do not clearly lead to the formation of the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it involves alkylation, hydrogenation, and ozonolysis, which could potentially lead to the formation of the target molecule. However, the sequence is not fully consistent, and the exact transformation pathways remain unclear. Based on the given choices, **Option C** is selected as the best answer.
