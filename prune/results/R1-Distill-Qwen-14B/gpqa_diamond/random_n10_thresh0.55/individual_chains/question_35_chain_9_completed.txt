Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

So, I think I should write out the matrix for A_y. Since c is h/(4π), the matrix would be c multiplied by S. Let me calculate that. 

S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying each element by c:
A_y = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So, A_y is:
[ 0        -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))       0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, S is a 2x2 matrix, so when multiplied by c, each element becomes c multiplied by the element of S. So the first element is 0 * c, so 0. The (1,2) element is -i * c, so that's -i*(h/(4π)). Similarly, the (2,1) element is i * c, which is i*(h/(4π)). And the (2,2) element is 0.

So A_y is:
[ 0      -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0      ]

Wait, but wait. I've heard that angular momentum operators have specific forms. For spin-½ particles, the Pauli matrices come into play. The S matrices are proportional to the Pauli matrices. For example, S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait, but here c is h/(4π) and the S matrix given is the same as the Pauli matrix σ_y multiplied by (ħ/2) or something? Let me think. 

Wait, Planck's constant h is equal to 2πħ. So, ħ = h/(2π). So, if S is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2, then S would be (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, no, let me check. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The spin operator S for a spin-½ particle is (ħ/2) σ. So, S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. 

But in this problem, A_y is c·S, and S is given as that matrix. Let me see. Let me compute c·S. If c is h/(4π), and S is the matrix with rows (0, -i) and (i, 0), then each element is multiplied by c.

So, when I write A_y, each element is c times the S element. So, the (1,2) element is -i c, and (2,1) is i c. So, A_y becomes:

[0       (-i)(h/(4π)) ]
[ i(h/(4π))  0 ]

Hmm, but wait. Wait, what is the actual form of the angular momentum operator's Y component. For a spin-½ particle, the Y-component of spin is S_y. Which is given by (ħ/2)σ_y. So, S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix σ_y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, S_y = [[0, -i (ħ/2)], [i (ħ/2), 0 ] ].

Wait, but in our problem, A_y is c times S. Wait, no, the given S is the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and A_y is c multiplied by that. So, c is h/(4π). Let me compute that:

c = h/(4π) → which is (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So, c is ħ/2. So, A_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly the same as S_y. So, A_y is the same as S_y. Because S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, and σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, A_y is S_y.

Wait, that's a key point. So, A_y is the spin Y-component operator for a spin-½ particle. So, when we're looking for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, we're essentially finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S_y, which is the standard spin operator in Y direction.

So the eigenvalues of S_y are known to be ± ħ/2. Because for a spin-½ particle, S_y |ψ> = (± ħ/2) |ψ>. Wait, but wait. Let me confirm. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2? No, wait no. Wait, the eigenvalues of S_y are ± (ħ/2), yes. Because the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, and S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So when σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

But wait, the question says that A_y is c·S, where c is h/(4π). Let me compute c. Since h = 2πħ, c = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So indeed, c is ħ/2. So A_y is (ħ/2) * S, where S is the sigma_y matrix. So A_y is the same as S_y, as I thought earlier. So the eigenvalues of A_y are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the options don't seem to have ħ/2. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right. Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Wait, the operator A_y is c multiplied by S, and S is the given matrix. Let me write A_y's matrix:

A_y = c * S = [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ]

Since c is h/(4π), that gives:

A_y = [ [0, -i (h/(4π))], [i (h/(4π)), 0] ]

So, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

The matrix A_y - a I is:

[ -a        -i (h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π))  -a       ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i (h/(4π)))(i (h/(4π))) ] 

Which is a^2 - [ (-i * i) (h^2/(16 π²)) ) ]

Compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a^2 - [ (1) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ] = 0.

So, a^2 = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, so the eigenvalues of A_y are ± h/(4π) ?

Wait, wait. But earlier I thought that A_y is the same as S_y. Because c is ħ/2, and S is sigma_y, so A_y would be (ħ/2) sigma_y, which would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But according to solving the matrix equation, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π) = ± ħ/2 since h=2πħ. So both agree. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is same as ± h/(4π) because h=2πħ → ħ = h/(2π).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So, the real parts are ± h/(4π), and what about the imaginary parts? The eigenvalues are real numbers, because the angular momentum operators have real eigenvalues. So the imaginary part is zero. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im eigenvalue ±2πh, Re ±h/(4π) → Im part is wrong; eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, Re ±1 → again, Im parts are wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A^2, but not Az. Let's think about that. Because A^2 is the square of the angular momentum operator. For spin-½, the eigenvalues of A^2 are ħ^2 s(s+1), where s=1/2. So the eigenfunctions of A^2 are the same as those of any component's eigenfunctions. Wait, no. The eigenfunctions of A_x, A_y, A_z are eigenvectors of those respective operators, but they are not eigenvectors of A^2 because A^2 commutes with all components. Wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, A^2 commutes with each component, so the eigenfunctions of any component are also eigenfunctions of A^2. Because [A_x, A^2] = 0, same for A_y and A_z. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A^2. So option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A^2, but not Az. Wait, but the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, because [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax (from angular momentum commutation relations), so they don't commute. So an eigenstate of Ay won't be an eigenstate of Az. So the statement in option C is correct. But let me think more.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. The basis functions are typically the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis. But I'm not sure if this is correct in all contexts. If the operator is 2x2, and it's diagonalizable, which it is because it's a spin operator, which has two distinct eigenvalues, then the eigenvectors form a basis. So option D would be correct as well. But let me think.

Looking at the options again, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Now, the question is which statement is correct. Let's re-examine each option.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Im part ±1/2, real ±1. No, because eigenvalues are ±h/(4π) which, with h=2πħ, is ± ħ/2, which is real. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As mentioned earlier, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² because A² commutes with Ay. So they are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax, so they don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The basis functions would be the eigenfunctions since the operator is 2x2 and diagonalizable. So D is correct as well. But wait, are the eigenfunctions the basis functions? Well, the matrix representation uses the basis vectors, which could be any basis, but the question says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. I'm a bit confused, but in any case, the question is about what is correct during the calculation.

So, the correct statements would be C and D, perhaps.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, the question says, "During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So, when solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of the statements is correct.

So let's reevaluate each option.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Since A² and Ay commute (because A² is the sum of squares of all components, and each component commutes with the sum of squares), the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

The basis functions of the matrix are the basis vectors in which the matrix is expressed. So if the operator is represented in the standard basis (e.g., spin up and down along some axis), then the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) might form a different basis, but not necessarily the same as the basis in which the matrix is written. Alternatively, if the matrix is diagonal in that basis, then the basis functions would be the eigenvectors. Wait, but in this case, the operator is a 2x2 matrix, and the basis is any orthonormal basis. So if the operator is diagonal in that basis, then the basis vectors are the eigenvectors. But in our case, the matrix for A_y is not diagonal. It's [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], which is a Pauli matrix, which is not diagonal. So the eigenvectors would form a different basis. Therefore, the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix operator unless you're using the eigenbasis.

Wait, but the question says, "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So if the matrix is given in the standard basis (like the computational basis |0> and |1>), then its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not the same as the basis functions. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but the matrix's eigenfunctions are the basis vectors in the eigenbasis of Ay. So the statement in D is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay's matrix. If the matrix is expressed in a particular basis, then the basis functions are the basis vectors of that basis. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are not necessarily the same as the basis functions. So D's statement is correct only if the matrix is diagonal in the basis of its eigenfunctions, which it is. Because in the eigenbasis, the matrix would be diagonal. So if the matrix is given in the eigenbasis, then yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But in the problem statement, the matrix is given in the standard basis (since S is given as [[0, -i],[i,0]] which is in the computational basis), so the eigenfunctions are not the basis functions of the matrix. So D is incorrect.

So, the correct statement is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting \( c \), the matrix for \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
To find the eigenvalues \( a \), we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \):

\[
\det\begin{bmatrix} 
-a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ 
i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a 
\end{bmatrix} = a^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi} \cdot i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0.
\]

This gives \( a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \), so the eigenvalues are:

\[
a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Since \( h = 2\pi\hbar \), we can also express the eigenvalues as \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenvalues are real, meaning the imaginary parts are zero.

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, not complex.

- **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

- **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the same as the basis functions in which the matrix is represented. The matrix is given in the computational basis, and the eigenfunctions form a different basis.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the other operators.

Answer: C
