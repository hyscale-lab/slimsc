Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see...

The question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that for them moving.

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, okay, so point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are arranged around it, each 2 meters away.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system. So I think that implies we're considering the electrostatic potential energy of the entire system. Because in an isolated system, other forces like gravity or whatever aren't acting, so the energy would be all about the electric potential.

So, the question is about the minimum energy. Oh, right, because for a system of charges, the potential energy is determined by their configuration. The minimum energy would probably be when all the charges are as close as possible, but wait, in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So their distance from P is fixed, but how are they arranged relative to each other?

Wait, maybe the charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around point P. So each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from P. So that means each 2e charge is at a fixed radius of 2m, but they can be anywhere on the sphere. But for the potential energy calculation, maybe the arrangement of the 12 charges among themselves doesn't matter because all are identical and the configuration is symmetric.

Wait, but when you calculate the potential energy of a system of charges, you consider the potential energy between each pair. So for a system with N charges, the total potential energy is (1/(4πε₀)) * sum over all pairs of (Q_i Q_j)/r_ij.

But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so the other 12 are each at a distance of 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the 13th. But what about their distances from each other?
