Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and complex formation. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution of Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanate complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, but wait, no, wait. Wait, I might be getting confused.

Wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I remember that the different complexes of Co(II) with thiocyanate have different colors. The blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex, right? Or wait, I think [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue, and maybe the other complexes are different colors. So, the question is asking for the percentage of this blue complex compared to all the cobalt species present.

Stability constants (β) are given for each complex. The general formula for the stability constant is β_n = [Co(SCN)_n]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So, each β represents the formation of a complex with n SCN^- ions.

Wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), because each SCN- is a ligand. So for n=1, it's [Co(SCN)]^+, since 2+ - 1 = +1. Similarly, for n=2, it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Because 2+ - 2(1-) = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, each SCN- is -1, so for n SCN-, the charge is -n. The Co is +2, so the complex charge is 2+ - n*(1-) = (2 -n)+. So for n=1, it's [Co(SCN)]^+ (charge +1). For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral). For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3
