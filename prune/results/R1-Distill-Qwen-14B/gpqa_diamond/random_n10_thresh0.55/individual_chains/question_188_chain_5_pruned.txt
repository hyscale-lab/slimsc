Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, but I don't need to worry about them right now; I'll work it out.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is calculated using the formula that involves the lattice parameters and the angles between the lattice vectors. For a general crystal system, the formula is a bit complicated, but I think for a rhombohedral system, there's a specific approach.

Wait, a rhombohedral crystal has all edges equal and all angles equal. So the lattice is a special case where a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma. That makes sense. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system must take into account the angles. I think the general formula for d is (a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ))) ) / sqrt( [h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ] ). Wait, no, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dot product. Oh right, the formula is derived from the Miller indices and the lattice vectors.

Wait, I think the formula is d = (1/ (sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )) )) multiplied by some factor. Or wait, perhaps it's d = (a) / sqrt( [h² +k² +l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)] ). No wait, perhaps a different arrangement.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to recall that for a general cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but when the angles aren't 90 degrees, it's more complex. For a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0 and angles alpha, the formula for d is d = a0 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ).

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar spacing can be found using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) ( (1 - cos α) / (1 + cos α) )) ).

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't do that right now, perhaps I can derive it.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = (1/√( (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 - 2 h k a
