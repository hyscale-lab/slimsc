Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not super familiar with the notation, so I'll need to think through it.

The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. The term probably implies that the boson X couples to fermions f. So, X can decay into pairs of these fermions.

Wait, but what fermions are allowed? The couplings determine which fermions can be produced. So, looking at the Lagrangian, I see that the interaction is with ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So, X can couple to any fermion f that is present in the model.

But wait, the options given include various particles. For example, options A and D include b quarks, while B and C include c quarks. So I need to figure out which fermions the boson X can decay into, based on the mass.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion would take away some energy, so the sum must be less than or equal to X's mass.

So, let's think about the masses of the fermions. The known fermion masses are:

- Up and down quarks: very light, about 2-5 MeV. So, their mass is negligible compared to 6 GeV.
- Strange quark: around 95-100 MeV. So 2m_s is about 200 MeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into s sbar.
- Charm quark: around 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is about 2.4-3 GeV. That's less than 6 GeV, so X can decay into c cbar.
- Bottom quark: around 4.1-4.7 GeV. 2m_b is about 8.2-9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar.
- Top quark is way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So definitely can't decay into t tbar.
- For leptons, the masses are:
   - Electron, muon, tau: electron is about 0.0005 GeV, muon ~0.105 GeV, tau ~1.78 GeV.
   So 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.
   For muons, 2m_mu is about 0.21 GeV, so that's allowed.
   Electrons are even lighter, so that's allowed too.

Wait, but the options also have options about whether they include b quarks. Let's recheck the allowed fermions.

So, allowed fermions for decay are those where 2m_f
