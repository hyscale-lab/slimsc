Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, I remember that luminosity has something to do with the star's radius and temperature. Let me think.

The question says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And also, the mass is 1.5 times larger. Wait, but mass might not directly affect luminosity unless we're considering something else like fusion rates, but the question says to assume they radiate as black bodies. Oh right, the black body radiation formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

The question mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2, so T1 = T2.

Wait, the stars have the same temperature then. So their temperatures are equal. So when calculating luminosity, since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same for both, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (R1/R2)². Because T1 and T2 are the same, T⁴ cancels out.

So R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So that would make the ratio 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, option D is ~2.23. Wait, but wait. Are there any other factors involved here?

Oh, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted light is blueshifted or redshifted. But wait, in the question, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. So the Doppler shift would affect the measured λ_max.

Wait, let me think. The actual λ_max emitted by each star is determined by their temperatures. But when observed,
