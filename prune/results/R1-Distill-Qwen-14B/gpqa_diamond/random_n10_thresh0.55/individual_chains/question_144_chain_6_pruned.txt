Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We're asked to find the mean decay distance. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like decay length L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c).

Wait, but how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh right, the relation between the width Γ and the lifetime is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. So that's the starting point.

First, let me figure out the units. Oh, everything's in GeV and MeV, so I need to convert them into appropriate units for calculations. Let me write down the values:

E_X = 8 GeV = 8e3 MeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV
Γ_X =320 MeV.

Wait, but wait, E_X is the production energy, and m_X is the mass. Hmm, but for a resonance, the production energy would be around the mass, but maybe it's not directly relevant here. Wait, or is the energy E_X the center-of-mass energy? I'm not sure, but perhaps the energy E_X isn't directly needed for the decay length calculation. Because decay length depends on the lifetime and velocity, which are determined by the mass and width.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is needed to find the velocity. Because the velocity β is v/c, and that depends on the energy of the particle.

Wait, particles decay when they are moving, so their lifetime is dilated by gamma, the Lorentz factor. So the mean lifetime observed is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ. So the observed lifetime is τ_obs = γ * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime (which is τ = ħ / Γ, because Γ is the total decay width and Γ = ħ / τ_proper.

Wait
