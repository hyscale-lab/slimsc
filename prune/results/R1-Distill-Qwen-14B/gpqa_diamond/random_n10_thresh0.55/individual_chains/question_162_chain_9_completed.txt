Alright, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, okay, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So, this is a two-dimensional metric, right? It looks like it's written in terms of x and y coordinates. I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, but here it's probably just a two-dimensional surface.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface in hyperbolic geometry. But I'm a bit confused. I think a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature, right? So, its Gaussian curvature is negative. But I'm not exactly sure how that connects to the metric given.

Let me think about the form of the metric. The coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, 4 is 2 squared, so maybe the radius r is 2 as given. So the denominator is (r² - x² - y²), right? Because r is 2, so denominator is 4 - (x² + y²).

I remember that metrics for surfaces can sometimes be written in different forms. For example, the metric for a sphere might involve (r² - x² - y²) in the denominator. Wait, no, the sphere's metric is different. Oh, wait, perhaps this is related to a hyperbolic metric, like the Poincaré disk model?

In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually given by ds² = (4/(R²(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)^2)) (dx² + dy²), where R is the radius of the disk. Wait, I think the denominator is (1 - (x² + y²)/R²) squared, so overall it's like 1/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)^2 multiplied by a factor.

If I compare this to the given metric, let's see. The given metric has a denominator (4 - x² - y²), which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So that's (4 - (x² + y²)) = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the given metric is:

ds² = (32) / [4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] * (dx² + dy²)

Simplify the 32 and 4: 32/4 is 8. So it becomes 8 / (1 - (x² + y²)/4) * (dx² + dy²). Hmm, but the standard Poincaré disk model's metric is (4/(R²)) / (1 - (x² + y²)/R²)^2 * (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is squared, but here it's only to the first power.

Wait, maybe this isn't the Poincaré disk then. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different model, like the Beltrami-Klein model, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a metric for a sphere.

Wait, for a sphere, the metric in 3D is usually expressed in terms of spherical coordinates, but perhaps in 2D it's similar. Let me think. The metric for a sphere of radius a in 2D could be something like ds² = a² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²), but that's in spherical coordinates. Alternatively, if using polar coordinates (r, φ), the metric would be dr² + (a² - r²) dφ², but that's for a flat space, not a sphere.

Wait, no, the metric for a sphere in 2D would have (a² - r²) in the denominator? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this metric is for something else.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere... Oh, wait, but a pseudosphere is an infinite surface, right? So its area would be infinite. Hmm, but let me think more carefully.

Wait, the options suggest that the area could be 0, 4π(x² + y²), 4π(x² - y²), or infinity. Option D is +infty.

In hyperbolic geometry, for a pseudosphere, the area is infinite because it's like a horn that extends infinitely. So the area would be unbounded.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So if the pseudosphere has finite radius, does that change anything? Hmm, no, I think a pseudosphere is an infinitely extending surface. So its area is infinite.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the metric given is that of a sphere, not a pseudosphere. Because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which would be positive if x² + y² <4. So perhaps this is a spatial slice, like a sphere of radius 2.

Wait, in that case, the surface would have a finite area. For a sphere, the area is 4πr². Since r=2, area would be 4π*(2)^2 = 16π. But none of the options mention 16π. The options have 4π(x² + y²), which doesn't make sense because x² + y² would vary, but the area should be a number.

Wait, perhaps the given metric isn't for a sphere but for a pseudosphere. But then the area would be infinite, making option D correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the induced metric on a sphere embedded in 3D. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which is positive only when x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But wait, that's for a sphere if we're in 3D, or for hyperbolic space if it's embedded in another way.

Wait, if this were a sphere, the area would be 4πr², which for r=2 is 16π. But that's not one of the options. The options are B and C which are 4π times something, but they depend on x and y, which doesn't make sense. Unless I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the area of the surface, but the area of a specific region. But the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." So a pseudosphere is a surface with infinite area. So the area would be infinity, making option D correct.

Wait, but another thought: in the metric given, the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So for points where x² + y² approaches 4, the coefficient becomes very large, leading to an infinite area as you approach the edge.

But I'm a bit confused because the problem says "pseudosphere of radius r=2." Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric for a sphere of radius 2, but the area would be finite, 16π. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, let me think about the geometry of the metric. The metric is conformally flat, as it's scale-invariant except for the coefficient. So the curvature can be found by looking at the Laplacian of the conformal factor.

In 2D, the Ricci scalar curvature R is given by:

R = -2 * (1/g) * ∇² (sqrt(g)),

where g is the determinant of the metric. Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the Gaussian curvature K is given by (1/(4π)) times the integral of the Euler characteristic over the surface. But maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric.

Alternatively, the Gaussian curvature K can be computed from the metric. For a metric given by ds² = E dx² + E dy² (since it's conformally flat, E is the coefficient), the curvature is K = - (1/(2E)) * (∂² ln E / ∂x² + ∂² ln E / ∂y²) ).

Wait, perhaps more accurately, for a metric ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = - (1/2) Δ (ln f),

where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space.

So let me compute this.

First, f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So ln f = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²).

So the Laplacian of ln f is:

Δ (ln f) = ∇² (ln f) = ∇² [ln(32)] - ∇² [ln(4 - x² - y²)].

But ln(32) is a constant, so its Laplacian is zero. So,

Δ (ln f) = - ∇² [ln(4 - x² - y²)].

Compute the Laplacian:

The function inside is ln(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

Compute the Laplacian in polar coordinates. The Laplacian of ln(4 - r²) is:

(1/r) d/dr [ r d/dr (ln(4 - r²)) ) ]

First derivative: d/dr (ln(4 - r²)) = (-2r)/(4 - r²).

Multiply by r: r * (-2r)/(4 - r²) = (-2 r²)/(4 - r²).

Then take derivative with respect to r:

d/dr [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ] 

Let me compute this derivative.

Let me set u = r², so the expression is (-2 u)/(4 - u).

Derivative with respect to u is (-2(4 - u) - (-2 u)(-1) ) / (4 - u)^2.

Wait, that's not quite right, perhaps I should compute it directly.

Alternatively, let me compute it as:

d/dr [ (-2 r²) / (4 - r²) ) ] = [ (-4 r)(4 - r²) ) - (-2 r²)( -2 r ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Wait, let me apply the quotient rule: d/dr [numerator/denominator] = (num’ * denominator - numerator * denom’ ) / denominator².

numerator = -2 r² → num’ = -4 r.

denominator = 4 - r² → denom’ = -2 r.

So,

[ (-4 r)(4 - r²) - (-2 r²)(-2 r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2

Simplify numerator:

-4 r (4 - r²) - (4 r^3 )

= (-16 r +4 r³) -4 r³ 

= (-16 r +4 r³ -4 r³) = -16 r.

So the Laplacian is (1/r) * [ -16 r / (4 - r²)^2 ) ] = -16 / (4 - r²)^2.

Thus, Δ (ln f) = - ( -16 / (4 - r²)^2 ) ) = 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I might have messed up a sign here.

Wait, the function is ln(4 - r²), and its Laplacian is:

After differentiation, we got -16 r / (4 - r²)^2, and then the Laplacian is (1/r) * (-16 r)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = -16/(4 - r²)^2.

But wait, earlier I thought Δ (ln f) = - ∇² [ln(4 - r²)] = - [ -16/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ] = 16/(4 - r²)^2.

So K = - (1/2) * (16/(4 - r²)^2 ) ) 

Wait, because K = - (1/2) * Δ (ln f) = - (1/2) * [16/(4 - r²)^2 ].

So K = -8/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but r² is x² + y². So for points inside the disk r < 2, the denominator is positive, so K is negative. That implies this is a hyperbolic metric, which fits with the pseudosphere.

So the Gaussian curvature is negative everywhere, which makes it a model of hyperbolic geometry. So this is indeed a pseudosphere.

Now, about the area. Since this is a hyperbolic surface, it's non-compact, meaning it extends infinitely. So the total area is infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So that's the correct answer.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric describes a two-dimensional surface. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) suggests that the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane, as the expression is positive only when \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\).

A pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature, which is characteristic of hyperbolic geometry. The metric provided is consistent with a hyperbolic surface, as it has negative curvature everywhere within the domain \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). In hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is an infinitely extending surface, meaning its total area is unbounded and infinite.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (0):** This is incorrect because the pseudosphere is not a degenerate surface with zero area.
- **Option B (\(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)):** This is incorrect because the area of a surface should not depend on coordinates like \(x\) and \(y\).
- **Option C (\(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)):** This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option B.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\)):** This is correct because the pseudosphere is an infinitely extending surface, and its total area is unbounded.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
