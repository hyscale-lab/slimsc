Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to parse it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. I remember that in quantum mechanics, these components correspond to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh, right, because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices and are used for spin-1/2 particles like the muon.

The problem gives me each component of P as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to get a clear picture.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

P_y is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

P_z is (ħ/2) times:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

Okay, I remember that the Pauli matrices are usually σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, which are exactly these matrices without the ħ/2 factor. So P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, same for the others.

The operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in x-z. Let me think about how the operator P acts along direction n.

The operator for spin along a direction n is given by P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. So n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, but wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Oh, right, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ cosφ, but since n is in x-z plane, φ is zero. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ? Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector can be written as n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since our direction is in the x-z plane, φ is 0, right? Because the x-z plane has φ=0 or π. So n_x would be sinθ, and n_z would be cosθ. Wait, because for φ=0, cosφ=1, sinφ=0. So n_x = sinθ * 1 = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ. So yes, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, no, I think I have that mixed up. Let me think again. The polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis towards the xy-plane. So when θ=0, the direction is along +z. When θ=90 degrees, it's in the xy-plane, and so on.

So for a vector
