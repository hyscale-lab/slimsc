Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A would be protons plus neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons, so A=6. Oh wait, that would make it lithium-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

I remember that in particle physics, when calculating the energy of a collider, you're usually dealing with relativistic speeds. Since the speed here is 0.96c, which is pretty close to the speed of light, we’re definitely in the relativistic realm. So I need to use the relativistic energy equations.

First, I think about the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0c². But wait, the problem is asking for the energy of the collider. I'm not exactly sure if that's the total energy, kinetic energy, or something else. Usually, in colliders, they talk about the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm, I might need to clarify that.

Wait, the question says, what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. I think RHIC accelerates heavy
