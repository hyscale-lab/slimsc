Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. 

We have a compound X with given IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options provided. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... I remember that's a typical reaction for hydrolyzing certain groups, maybe something like an ester or an acid chloride? Or wait, no, I think red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or maybe that's another reaction. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have an ester and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it can cleave the ester into an acid and an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's more likely to be a reaction with a nitrile, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think.

Let me first analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what compound X is. 

Starting with the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, 3400 is more likely O-H (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid), and maybe an amide. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. That could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid. But 1720 is more typical for an ester or a ketone, perhaps. Then there's 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the range for aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, an aldehyde is usually around 9-10 as a triplet. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Because carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12, but that's typically a broad signal. Or maybe it's an enol proton? Hmm. Let me think. Wait, wait, another possibility is an aromatic -OH, but those are usually around 5-7 and broad, but sometimes in the 8-10 range if it's like a phenol with electron-withdrawing groups. Or maybe it's an aldehyde
