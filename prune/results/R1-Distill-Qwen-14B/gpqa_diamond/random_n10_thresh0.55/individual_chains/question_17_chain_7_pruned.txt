Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it through again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, which I think means that the calcium is completely complexed with EDTA. The concentration of this complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K value is 5x10^10, which I believe is the stability constant for the Ca-EDTA complex.

Hmm, right, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and it forms complexes with metal ions. The stability constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex, so the metal is more tightly bound.

So the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. When EDTA complexes with calcium, the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The stability constant K is equal to [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. That means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I'm supposed to find [Ca²+], the free calcium ion concentration. Since it's a 1:1 complex (each Ca²+ binds one EDTA^4-), the stoichiometry is 1:1.

But wait, if the complex is present at 0.02 M, and assuming that the solution is at ideal pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated (like in its Y^4- form), then the only species present would be the complex, right? Or are there any other factors?

Wait, but wait, no. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and the complex formation is pretty much complete. But in reality, EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. But the problem says pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that all EDTA is in the Y^4- form, so no other forms are present. That makes things simpler.

So the initial setup is that the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA²−. Then, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−
