Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see what I can do. The question is about identifying a product formed from a reaction. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the product is based on the given IR and NMR data.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, another peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H and C=O, so that fits. Alternatively, it could be an ester or maybe a ketone, but the broad peak around 3400-2500 suggests an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 are probably aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, maybe a benzoic acid derivative.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for a carboxylic acid proton. So that supports the idea of a benzoic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The double
