Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' sometimes, but the question uses 'plx'. I think that's just the symbol they're using for parallax.

So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The options are various powers of r, which is distance. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / parallax. So if parallax is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

The problem states the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. 

But since I need to find how N changes with distance, I should express plx in terms of distance. I know that plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, right, because parallax p = 1/d (in parsecs when p is in arcseconds). So plx is just 1/d.

So substituting that into the equation, N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. So (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1 divided by that would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait wait, let me double-check my substitution. So original equation: N = k * (1 / plx^5), where k is a constant of proportionality. Since plx = 1/d, then 1 / plx^5 = (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Wait, the options are about the change per unit range of distance. Oh right, so maybe it's asking about the differential, like dN/dr, the rate at which the number of stars increases (or decreases) with distance.

Hmm, because the question is phrased: "How does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps they are asking for the derivative of N with respect to r.

If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4. Wait, but looking at
