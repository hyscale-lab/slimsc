Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the details, but I'll do my best.

So the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-like in mass. The planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we see a shift in the spectral lines. The size of the shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital characteristics.

The question gives the peak velocity shifts for each planet. Planet #1's spectral line shifts by up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's by 7 milliangstroms. Wait, wait, no, actually, the question says the shift is periodic for each. Oh, right, because it's the Doppler shift due to the star's movement.

Wait, but I think the peak velocity shift (K) depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. Or is it the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve? I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by some formula involving the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, another approach is using the mass function, which relates K to the planet's mass and the inclination angle. But since the problem states that the planets are in circular orbits, maybe we can assume that the inclination is the same? Or perhaps that the Doppler shifts are directly related to the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, no, the Doppler shift (K) is actually given by the formula K = ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

But I might be mixing up the exact formula. Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(
