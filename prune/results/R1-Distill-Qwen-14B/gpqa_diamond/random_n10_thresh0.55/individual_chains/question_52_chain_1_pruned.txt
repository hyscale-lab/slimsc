Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about stars with and without spots, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

Wait, the star has some parameters: radius 1.5 solar, mass 1.1 solar. But maybe those aren't directly relevant here. The key details are about the effective temperature and the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels.

When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, but waitâ€”does that mean the spots are cooler regions?

But wait, how does covering part of the surface with spots affect the overall Teff? Oh, right, the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity. If 40% is covered by spots which are cooler, the average temperature must decrease. So the star's overall brightness is reduced.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation. In LTE, the ratio of populations is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) )

So the transition is between two levels, and the ratio of their populations depends on temperature. When the temperature changes, the ratio changes.

Wait wait, but the star has different regions with different temperatures. When spots are present, part of the surface is cooler. So when we observe the star, the overall
