Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR and reaction mechanisms, but I'll do my best.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, the molecular formula... Let me think. So C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18 -9 +1)/2 â†’ (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and some double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high ppm, likely an aldehyde proton. So maybe an aldehyde group is present.

- 6.98 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That could be aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Because in para substitution, you often get a doublet for the two Hs.

- 6.51 ppm is another doublet of 2H. Also aromatic. If the first one is 6.98, maybe that's the ortho positions, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps these are two different sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, another part: 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet... Could that be an -OH group? But wait, that's integrating for 2H. Maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's an enol form or a diol or something with two hydroxyls?

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's in the range for maybe a methylene group attached to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Or perhaps CH2O.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule has an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and perhaps a conjugated system.

So the initial structure could be something like a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde and some substituents. Let's think about the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm and 1H is definitely an aldehyde. So maybe the structure has an aldehyde group
