Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about exoplanet detection using the transit method, but with a twist involving star spots. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness that we can detect.

The problem says that a star with the same radius as the Sun has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The setup is that these spots cause brightness variations as the star rotates, which can mimic the transit of a planet. But the question is asking what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots.

Wait, but the question specifies that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would give the same signal. So I think I need to compare the brightness change caused by the spots (as observed) and figure out what planet size would cause a similar drop in brightness.

Let me think. The transit method's depth is given by (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So if a planet blocks a certain area, the depth is that squared term.

But in this case, the star's brightness variation isn't from a single transit but from the spots rotating into and out of view. But the problem says that the photometric variations are periodic and resemble those of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots is similar to what a planet would cause.

Wait, but how does the spot coverage affect the brightness variation? So when a spot is facing us, it contributes less light because it's cooler. As the star rotates, the spot comes into view and then goes away, causing a dip in brightness. But the problem says that one hemisphere is spotty, so maybe the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. Hmm.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (surface area of a hemisphere). Since a hemisphere's area is (4πR²)/2 = 2πR². So
