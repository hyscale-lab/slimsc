Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed — that's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame of reference, right? So I can't just subtract the velocities normally because that's only valid at non-relativistic speeds. Oh right, I remember there's a relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me get that right. So here, astronaut A has velocity u = 0.6c, and astronaut B has v = 0.5c. Wait, but which one is which? Oh wait, the question is about the relative speed of each from each other's perspective. Or maybe it's the speed of one as observed from the other's frame.

Wait no, the question says "relative speed" — which typically would be the speed of one astronaut relative to the other. But I have to be careful because it depends on the reference frames.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the speed of the center of mass frame, but the way the question is phrased, it's more likely the relative speed between the two.

Wait, no, the question says "relative speed and the total energy of the system."
