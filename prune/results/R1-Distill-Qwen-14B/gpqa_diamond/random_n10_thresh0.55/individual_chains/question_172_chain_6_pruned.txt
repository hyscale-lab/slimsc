Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let's see what the problem says. Two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And they're in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. I remember LTE means that the properties of the gas can be described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

The question is about finding the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2. The options are A to D, involving natural logs and combinations of T1 and T2.

So, I'm thinking about the Boltzmann distribution. The probability of a particle being in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the number of atoms in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me model this.

Let’s denote the energy levels. Let’s say the excited state is E, and the ground state is E1. But wait, the problem talks about a specific energy level. Oh, maybe it's the ratio between two energy levels. Or perhaps the ratio of the populations of two energy levels.

Since the energy difference is given as delta E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, the exact energy might not be needed because it's given, but the ratio of the populations depends on the temperatures.

The ratio of the population of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2)/(n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. If E2 is higher than E1, then the ratio n2/n1 is exp( -delta E/(k T) ), where delta E is E2-E1.

If star_1 has twice as excited as star_2, does that mean n1/n2 = 2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if the energy level in question is an excited state, then perhaps n_excited_1 / n_excited_2 = 2.

But wait, I
