Okay, let me try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. 

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W, precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which is around 4 degrees Celsius, I think. Also, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Additionally, I need to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X.

Let me break this down. First, let's think about the reaction itself. X reacts violently with Y to produce W, a gas. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. 

What gases have the same number of protons and neutrons? Well, let's see. For example, H2O isn't a gas in this context. Wait, maybe it's something like methane, but that's CH4. No, wait, another approach: hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons in H2, but that's not equal. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in He, so that's 2 each. But He is a noble gas and is a monoatomic gas. Another possibility is CO2, but that's more complicated. Wait, wait, maybe it's NH3? No, that's 14 (for N) and 3 H. Wait, no, the molecule itself should have same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like CH4O, but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is H2O. Let's see: H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So, the molecule: total protons = 2 + 8 =10, neutrons from O is 8, plus H has 0. So, 8. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe W is something else.

Wait, the gas molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. So for example, if the molecule is CF4:
