Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms in the spectral line. Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method detects the velocity of the star's movement towards and away from us. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is given by the equation:

K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (c * sqrt(1 - e^2))) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. But I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) ), but that might be getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. The RV method's semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination angle (but since it's a transiting planet, we might assume sin i is 1, but the question doesn't mention transits, so perhaps we can't assume that. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify inclination, so maybe it's not a factor here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula provided in the Doppler method is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3 * (M_star + M_p)^(1/3)) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbital parameters. I recall that the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

Since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, and the stars have masses similar to the Sun, M_p is much smaller than M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and sin i is roughly 1 (assuming i is close to 90 degrees, which is the best case for RV detection). Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so
