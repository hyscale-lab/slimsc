Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, right. So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. Oh, and they mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. 

Wait, I remember that the index of refraction n is related to the speed of light in the medium. Oh right, the formula is n = c / v_glass, where v_glass is the speed of light in the medium. So normally, when the medium is stationary, the speed would be v_glass = c/n.

But wait, this glass is moving. So the speed of light as observed in the lab isn't just v_glass, because the glass is moving. Hmm, so maybe we have to consider relative velocities here. I remember something about the addition of velocities in special relativity. Oh wait, but this is a physics problem, and when it comes to light, we have to think relativistically, right?

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium isn't the same as in a vacuum. So in the medium, the speed is v_glass = c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? Oh wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in
