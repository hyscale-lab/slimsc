Okay, so I've got this question about mitochondrial function and an experiment to determine which method won't help in discovering the role of a drug on mitochondria. Let me break it down.

The question is about a new anti-diabetes drug, and the researcher is using HEK293 cells. They want to see if the drug affects mitochondria. So the options are experiments A-D, and I need to find which one won't help.

First, I should think about each option and what each technique does.

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria followed by a Glucose Uptake Assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is a standard method to isolate mitochondria because they pellet at certain speeds. So if you extract mitochondria and then do a glucose assay, maybe it's looking at mitochondrial glucose uptake? But wait, I thought mitochondria don't usually take up glucose directly because they can't transport it. Glucose is processed in the cytosol, broken down into pyruvate, which then enters the mitochondria. So if the assay is measuring glucose uptake, maybe it's not directly measuring mitochondrial function. Or perhaps the assay is measuring something else, but I'm not sure. I need to think more.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. Hmm, luciferase is an enzyme that emits light when it reacts with luciferin. But wait, if the cells are transformed with luciferase, maybe it's being expressed in the mitochondria? Oh wait, there's a version called Mitochondrial Luciferase, where the enzyme is targeted to the
