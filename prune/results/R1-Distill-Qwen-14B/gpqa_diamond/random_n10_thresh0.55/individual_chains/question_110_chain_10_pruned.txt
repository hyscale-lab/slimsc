Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory. The key point is to determine which stars are bright enough for both instruments.

First, I'll recall the given information. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, meaning apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17, since lower magnitudes are brighter. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16, so apparent magnitude ≤16.

Wait no, actually, wait: the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, stars with apparent V ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V ≤16 mag. So a star must be ≤16 mag to be detected by HIRES, and ≤17 mag for ESPRESSO. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 to be detected by both because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is ≤16, it's also ≤17. So the target stars must have apparent V magnitude ≤16.

But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So each star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 to be detected by both. Because if it's more than 16, HIRES can't detect it. So that's the main point.

Now, let's look at each star and compute their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (dust) if given.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d) = 15.5 +5 +5*log10(10) = 15.5 +5 +5*(1) = 15.5 +10 =25.5. Wait, no! Wait, no. Wait, the formula for absolute magnitude is m = M +5 log10(d) -5. Oh wait, I think I messed up the formula.

Wait, the formula is: m = M +5 * (log10(d) -1), where d is in parsecs. So for Star1, d=10 pc. log10(10)=1. So m = 15.5 +5*(1-1) =15.5 +0=15.5. So apparent magnitude is 15.5. But wait, is there any extinction? Star1 doesn't mention any E(B-V), so no extinction. So m=15.5. But 15.5 is less than 16, so it can be detected by both. Wait, but wait. Wait, 15.5 is less than 16, so it's bright enough for both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5 mag. So that's m=16.5. Now, 16.5 is greater than 16. So HIRES can't detect it (since it requires ≤16). But ESPRESSO can, since ≤17. So Star2 can't be detected by both, only by ESPRESSO. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag. But wait, there's extinction. E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. So the total absorption (extinction) in V is A(V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A(V).
