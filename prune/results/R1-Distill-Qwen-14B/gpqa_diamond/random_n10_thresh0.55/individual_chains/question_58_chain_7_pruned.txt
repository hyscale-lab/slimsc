Alright, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out which theory never requires regularization. Let me think through each option.

Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. I remember that regularization helps make these infinities manageable so you can renormalize the theory. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have some other properties that prevent these divergences.

Let's look at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory that includes supersymmetry. I think string theories in general try to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. They involve higher dimensions and are supposed to be background-independent. Wait, but do they require regularization? I remember that in string theory, the concept of regularization might not be the same as in other QFTs. Because strings are extended objects, maybe the theory doesn't have the same loop divergences as point particles. Or perhaps they use different methods, like the string sigma model, which might be finite. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Yang-Mills. It's known to be asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak. But wait, does that mean it doesn't have divergences? No, I think QCD still has divergent loop diagrams, especially at lower energies. Regularization is definitely used here, like using methods such as lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So B needs regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that in QED, there are issues with divergences in loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. These require regularization and renormalization. So C does need regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics. So they don't have divergences in the same way as quantum theories. Like, Maxwell's equations in classical E&M don't have the same infinities because they're not dealing with things like virtual particles or loop corrections. So I think classical theories don't require regularization at all. So D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization
