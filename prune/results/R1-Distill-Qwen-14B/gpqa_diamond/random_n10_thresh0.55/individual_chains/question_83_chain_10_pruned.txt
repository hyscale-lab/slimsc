Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. 

Alright, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values. 

I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it will form the acetate ion. The pH changes based on how much base has been added.

First, let me figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be... let's see, concentration is moles over volume. But wait, the moles of acetic acid before and after (since water doesn't have any) should stay the same.

Calculating the moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L, so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed is moles divided by concentration: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So how much has reacted?

At 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So initially, we have 0.001 mol CH3COOH. After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So that neutralizes 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So the remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the acetate ions are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since we're dealing with a buffer solution here (a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the -log(Ka). The Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.7398, approximately 4.74.

Plugging in the values: pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's calculate that ratio. 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

The log of 0.3333 is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263. That rounds to about 4.26. So the pH at 25% titration is roughly 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The moles of acetate ion will be 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) plus 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

[acetate] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, to find the pH, we can use the Kb and the concentration. Since Kb is very small, the hydrolysis can be approximated.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (0.02) = Kb.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. This is [OH^-].

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, that's not matching with any of the options. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis formula correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should set up the equation properly. Let me think.

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentration: 0.02 M, others zero.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small compared to 0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)
