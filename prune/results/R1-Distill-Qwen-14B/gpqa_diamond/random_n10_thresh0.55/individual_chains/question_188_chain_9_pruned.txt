Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. All the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, what do I remember about rhombohedral crystals? Oh right, rhombohedral is a type of crystal structure where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. So it's a special case of a hexagonal crystal? Or maybe a cubic? No, wait, rhombohedral is a separate system. Oh right, in the cubic system, when all angles are 90 degrees, it's cubic. If the angles are different but all edges are the same, that's rhombohedral.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter. So in a cubic system, the lattice parameter a would be the same as the interatomic distance. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, since the angles might not be 90 degrees, the actual interatomic distance might be a function of the lattice parameter and the angles. Hmm, do I need to find the lattice parameter 'a' first?

Wait, the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. That might be the same as 'a' in
