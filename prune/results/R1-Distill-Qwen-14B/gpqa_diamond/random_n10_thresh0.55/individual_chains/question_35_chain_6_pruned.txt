Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, muons are elementary particles, right? But I think the specifics about the particle might not be too important here; maybe it's more about the math of angular momentum operators.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me read the setup again.

So, Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second is (i, 0). Wait a second, that matrix S looks familiar. Oh right, I think that's the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices are used in spin-1/2 systems, like electrons or muons here.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Let's write down the matrix form for Ay. Since c = h/(4π), and S is the given matrix, Ay would be:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So first, let's compute the matrix Ay - a I.

The matrix Ay is:

[ (h/(4π))*0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i    (h/(4π))*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  0      ]

Subtracting a I, we get:

[ -a      -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π) -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (i * -i) (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, let's compute the (2,1) and (1,2) terms. The product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²/(4π)^2). Since i * (-i) is 1 because i*(-i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant becomes a² - [ (1)(h²/(16 π²)) ) ] = a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots gives a = ± h/(4 π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't align with what I just found. Because the eigenvalues a are real numbers, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian.

Wait wait, is Ay Hermitian? Let me check. The matrix Ay is c times S. c
