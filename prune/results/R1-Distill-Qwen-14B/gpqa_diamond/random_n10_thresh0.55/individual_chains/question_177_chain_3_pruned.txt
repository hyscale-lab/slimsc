Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again carefully.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, which probably relates to their temperatures. Oh wait, because for a black body, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1's velocity is 0 km/s, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Hmm, I'm not sure how the radial velocities come into play here. Maybe it's a red herring, or maybe it affects something else. But the main point for luminosity is about the black body radiation, so maybe the velocities affect the observed wavelengths, but since the peak wavelengths are already given as the same, perhaps the velocities don't directly influence the calculation of their intrinsic luminosities.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. So I need to find that factor using the given information.

The formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Bolt
