Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like in classical mechanics because of the relativity of velocity. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory of relativity.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh yeah, if you have two objects moving at speeds u and v relative to a rest frame, the speed of one as seen from the other isn't just u - v. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So I should apply that here.

Let me assign u and v. Wait, but which one is the observer's frame and which is the object? Oh wait, no, the formula is when both u and v are measured in the same frame, right? So if the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c and the second (3m) at 0.5c, both in the same direction, from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at what speed?

Wait, no, actually, the astronauts are moving relative to an external frame (like the Earth) at those speeds. So to find the relative speed between them, I need to calculate how fast one sees the other moving. Since they're moving in the same direction, it's the second astronaut that's slower, so the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c. Okay, so that's about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's good; the relative speed is 0.14c.

Now for the total energy.
