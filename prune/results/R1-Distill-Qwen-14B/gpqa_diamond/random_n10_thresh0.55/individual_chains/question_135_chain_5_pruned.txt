Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson called X. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out. I'm a bit rusty, but let's start breaking it down.

The question gives the interaction Lagrangian as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, the Lagrangian is part of the interaction between the boson X and fermions. So the term looks like it's a Yukawa coupling, similar to how the Higgs field interacts with fermions. The structure is similar to λ times the fermion field times X, so I think X is a scalar boson.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, I need to find which fermion pairs X can decay into.

In particle physics, for a boson to decay into fermions, the fermion mass must be less than half the boson's mass. Because in decay processes, the energy must be sufficient to create the particles. So for each possible fermion pair, their combined mass needs to be less than or equal to the mass of X.

So X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair if 2m_fermion ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Let me list all the known fermion masses. The quarks: up,
