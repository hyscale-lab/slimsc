Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Both stars are similar to our Sun. They found one planet around each, both with masses similar to Neptune. So, the planets are Neptune-like, which I remember are gas giants but smaller than Jupiter.

The planets are in circular orbits. Now, the radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift is periodic, matching the planet's orbital period.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, wait. So the shifts are different. I remember that the RV method's measured velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ). Wait, maybe I should think about the basic relation here.

The RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula for K is K = (v) = (2.15e-5) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (P / (1 day))^(1/3) ) ) m/s. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula, but I think K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Wait, the key thing is that for the same star mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) or something like that. Wait, let's get the exact relation.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be given by the formula:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2Ï€ c) )^(1/3) * (
