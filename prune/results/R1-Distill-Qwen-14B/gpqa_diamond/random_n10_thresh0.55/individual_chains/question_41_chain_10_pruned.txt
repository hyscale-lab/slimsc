Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through a moving glass. Hmm, I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer. Let me think about what I remember from relativity and optics.

Alright, the setup: a glass with index of refraction n is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. That might mean the light is moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving towards the observer too. Hmm, not sure if that's important yet.

The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way relativity works. So if the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of light inside it?

Wait, but light's speed is always c in a vacuum, right? But this isn't a vacuumâ€”it's glass. So the speed of light in glass is normally c/n. But when the glass is moving, what happens?

I think the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame is still c/n. Because in the frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. And when you switch frames, using the velocity addition formula, what's the velocity of the light as observed in the lab?

Wait, the glass is moving with velocity v, towards the observer, but the light is moving in
