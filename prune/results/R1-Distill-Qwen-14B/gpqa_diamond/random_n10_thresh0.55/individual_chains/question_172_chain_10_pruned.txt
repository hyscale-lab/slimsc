Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's think it through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. I remember that when atoms are excited, their electrons are in higher energy states, which relates to their temperature. Oh right, this must be about the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So, if I have two energy levels, say level 1 and level 2, the ratio n2/n1 = exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)).

Wait, in this case, the excitation is higher in star_1, so the population in the excited state would be higher. Let's say the ground state is E1 and the excited state is E2, with E2 > E1. The energy difference Î”E is given as 1.38e-23 J.

The problem states that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as much compared to star_2. So, for star_1, the ratio (n2/n1)_1 = 2. For star_2, let's call that ratio (n2/n1)_2. But wait, I need to think about what's the ratio. If in star_1, the excited state is more populated, then (n2/n1)_1 is higher. But since star_2 has lower excitation, (n2/n1)_2 would be lower.

So the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Wait no, the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited. So if the ratio (n2/n1) for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Wait, wait. Let me read the question again. "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think that means n2 for star_1 is twice n2 for star_2. Or maybe the ratio n2/n1 is twice as much. Hmm.

Wait,
