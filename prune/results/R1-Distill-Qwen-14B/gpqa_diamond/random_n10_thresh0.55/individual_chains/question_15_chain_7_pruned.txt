Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Hmm, transiting probability... I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the size of the star, but wait, there's more to it.

Both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh right, shorter period means it's closer to its star. Since they're using the RV method, which detects planets by their gravitational effect on the star's velocity, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

The host stars: the one hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Wait, why? Oh, maybe because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, perhaps a subgiant or something, so it's starting to expand but hasn't yet swelled up as a giant. So same radius but different masses.

Transit probability formula... I think the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is the planet radius and R_s is the star's radius. But wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Actually, the probability also depends on the orbital distance. Because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is closer to edge-on, but for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) * something... Wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_s + R_p)/(a * (1 - e²)^0.5), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so it's (R_s + R_p)/a. But for Earth-like planets, R_p is much smaller than R_s, so approximately R_s/a.

Wait, the transit probability is roughly (R_p / a) * (something else?), or is it (R_s + R_p) / a? Let me think. Oh right, the transit probability P is approximately (R_s + R_p) / a, but for small R_p compared to R_s, it's approximately R_s/a. Or more precisely, the probability is (R_p + R_s) / (a (1 - e²)^0.5), but since e is
