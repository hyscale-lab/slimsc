Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, which have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The researchers want to observe which one is more likely to transit because they only have limited observing time. So, the goal is to determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, making it a better target for observation.

Hmm, right. The transit method involves the planet passing in front of its host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight. But wait, I think the RV method gives us information about the planet's mass and the period, but not the exact inclination. So, the transit probability depends on the planet's orbital inclination.

Wait, the RV method detects planets through their Doppler shift, which doesn't depend on the inclination but gives the minimum mass. So, for RV, the inclination can vary, but the transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on. But how do we assess the probability?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is approximately R_planet / (R_star * a), where 'a' is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, I think the formula is more like the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Oh wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. The transit probability
