Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. Right, so the idea is that sometimes when you calculate loop integrals or other things, you get these infinities which aren't physical, so you need a way to handle them.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics. Let me think about each one.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory dealing with electrons and photons. I remember that in QED, when you calculate things like the electron self-energy, you end up with divergent integrals. So they use regularization methods, maybe like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization. So QED does require regularization. So option C is out because the question is asking which theory doesn't require it.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. At high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, which means the coupling constant decreases, and the theory becomes weakly interacting. But wait, does it still require regularization? I think because it's a renormalizable theory, perhaps it doesn't need regularization in the same way as non-renormalizable theories. Or wait, no, all quantum field theories that have divergences would require some form of regularization. But wait, maybe because it's a renormalizable theory, it can absorb the infinities via renormalization without needing to regularize beyond that? Or am I mixing things up? Wait, regularization is part of the renormalization process. So every QFT that has loop divergences needs regularization. So B would require it, so it's not the answer.

Superstring Theory is a theory of strings where particles are not point-like but extended. Strings can vibrate at different modes, which correspond to different particles. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in QFT. Wait, because in string theory, interactions are differentâ€”like instead of point interactions, you have stringy interactions which might result in different kinds of divergences. Or wait, I remember that in the early days of string theory, there was a problem with divergences, like the so
