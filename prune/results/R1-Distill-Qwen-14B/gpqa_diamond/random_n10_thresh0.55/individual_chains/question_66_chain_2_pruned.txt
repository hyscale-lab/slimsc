Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework where you add higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model to include possible new physics effects.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are various combinations of these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare is a bigger symmetry group. But in the context of the SMEFT, do the operators have to respect Poincare or just Lorentz?

I think that SMEFT is built in a way that the operators are Lorentz invariant. Because in the Standard Model, all terms respect Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT extends that. So operators in SMEFT would be constructed as Lorentz scalars. But about Poincare symmetry, I'm not so sure. Because Poincare includes momentum conservation, but the SMEFT operators can include higher-dimensional terms, maybe with derivatives acting on fields. Wait, but the way the operators are constructed, like with covariant derivatives, should make them Poincare invariant as well?

Wait, no. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz transformations but also translations. For a theory to respect Poincare symmetry, it must be translationally invariant. But in SMEFT, the operators can have higher dimensions. For example, operators like (Dμ ψ)† D^μ ψ are dimension 4, and that's invariant under Poincare. But higher-dimensional operators like (Dμ ψ)† D^μ Dν ψ would be dimension 5. Wait, but wait—does adding such operators break Poincare? No, because each term would still be a Lorentz scalar and translation-invariant.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because the effective theory includes all possible terms, but to keep the theory renormalizable, maybe they must respect certain symmetries. Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are constructed to be Lorentz invariant but may not all respect Poincare? No, I think Poincare is automatically satisfied if the theory is built with Lorentz invariance because the terms are built with derivatives in a way that's invariant under translations. So I think
