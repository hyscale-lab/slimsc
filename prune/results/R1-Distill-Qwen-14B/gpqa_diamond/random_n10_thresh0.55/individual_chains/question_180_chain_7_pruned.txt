Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges, potential energy comes into play. Since it's an isolated system, I probably don't have to worry about external fields or anything like that.

So, the setup is there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. 12 of these are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters from P.

Wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. I think the potential energy between charges is what matters here. But since the 13th charge is fixed, maybe the others are free to move, but they're constrained at 2 meters. Or wait, no, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so they can't move closer or farther. So the 13th is fixed, and the others are fixed at 2m positions.

But wait, how are the 12 arranged around P? Are they all on the same sphere at 2m radius? So, 12 equal charges placed symmetrically around P. Oh, like a regular dodecahedron or something? Or maybe they form a regular icosahedron or another shape. But the exact arrangement might not matter as much for the potential energy calculation because each
