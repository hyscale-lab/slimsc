Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Similarly, for the second state with Δt2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 1e-9 seconds for Δt1:
1.055e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.055e-25 J.

Converting J to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 J is 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So 1.055e-25 J * (6.242e18 eV/J) ≈ (1.055e-25) * (6.242e18) = approx 6.59e-7 eV. Yeah, that's correct.

Similarly for Δt2=1e-8 s:
1.055e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.055e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.055e-26 * 6.242e18 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.59e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.59e-8 eV.

The energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be larger than the sum of these uncertainties for the two levels to be distinguishable. Because if the difference is smaller than the combined uncertainty, you can't tell them apart—it would be like noise.

So the minimum ΔE needed would be approximately ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Adding them: 6.59e-7 eV + 6.59e-8 eV = 7.25e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So for them to be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

So the energy difference should be larger than 7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV. Hmm, that's 0.001 nanoeV? Wait, no, 1e-9 eV is 1 nanoeV. But 1e-9 is much smaller than the sum of uncertainties. So A is 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than 7.25e-7, so not enough.

Option B: 1e-11. Even smaller, so no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV. Oh, that's 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7 eV. So that's way larger than needed. So that would definitely be resolvable.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV. Wait, 1e-8 is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1 times the sum (since 7.25e-7 is 72.5e-8). So 1e-8 is smaller than 7.25e-7, so D isn't enough either.

Wait, so which options are possible? Only option C is higher than the required 7e-7 eV. So the correct answer must be C.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because perhaps I mixed up the formula. Oh wait, another approach: The energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy multiplied by some factor. Or perhaps it's the other way, the uncertainty principle is about not knowing the energy precisely, so to have distinct levels, the difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties.

So, for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ~ ħ/Δt1, and for E2, ΔE2 ~ ħ/Δt2.

Wait, so the sum of these two would be ΔE1 + ΔE2. So the energy difference between E1 and E2, ΔE, has to be greater than this sum for them to be distinguishable.

So, as I calculated, ΔE must be greater than approximately 7.25e-7 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9: 0.001e-6 → no.

B) 1e-11: even smaller→ no.

C) 1e-4: 1e-4 is 1e4 * 1e-8 → way bigger than 7.25e-7 → yes.

D) 1e-8: 0.1 * 7.25e-7 → no, because 1e-8 = 0.1e-7, which is less than 7.25e-7.

So the only option that's larger than 7.25e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV). So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required for two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguishable, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To clearly resolve the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than Option A and also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states can be clearly distinguished.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be distinguished.

### Final Answer:
The only option that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is **Option C**.
