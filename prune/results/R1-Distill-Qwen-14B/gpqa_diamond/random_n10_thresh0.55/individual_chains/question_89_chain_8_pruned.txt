Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide, giving product 3.

The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3. Specifically, what's the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

Hmm. Let me break it down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) heated. I remember that when a dibromide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it undergoes elimination, probably an E2 mechanism. So two adjacent bromines would eliminate to form a double bond. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions are important.

1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3. Heating with KOH would likely cause elimination to form an alkene. So product 1 is probably 1,3-diene or maybe a conjugated diene? Wait, no. Let me think: in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond structure. So if we eliminate H and Br from C1 and C3, would that form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or maybe it's a single double bond between C1 and C3? Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? No, wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are on the same face, perhaps. So elimination would form a double bond. Wait, no—elimination would lead to forming a double bond between the two adjacent carbons, but in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others, so the exact structure might be different.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond. Each carbon is connected to three others, forming a cage-like structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two of
