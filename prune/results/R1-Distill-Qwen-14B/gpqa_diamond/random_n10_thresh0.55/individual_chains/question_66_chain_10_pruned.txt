Okay, so I’ve got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and I'm a bit new to this, but I’ll try to think it through. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries, and I need to pick the correct combination.

Hmm, first, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added in a systematic way, respecting certain symmetries.

Wait, what's the deal with symmetries in effective theories? Well, the idea is that effective theories are constructed by adding terms that are consistent with the underlying theory's symmetries. So, SMEFT should respect the same symmetries as the SM, right?

Let me list the symmetries mentioned:

1. Lorentz Symmetry (L)
2. Poincare Symmetry (P)
3. CP Symmetry (CP)
4. CPT Symmetry (CPT)

I think Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Because Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz as well. But wait, in SMEFT, do we have to respect all of Poincare’s symmetries?

Well, the Standard Model does respect Poincare symmetry. So SMEFT, being an effective theory extending the SM, should also respect Poincare. So points 1 and 2 must be correct.

But wait, the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So are all operators in SMEFT required to respect all these symmetries?

Wait, CP symmetry is another thing. The SM does respect CP symmetry, but wait, no, the SM doesn't. Wait, I'm getting confused. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry entirely. There are CP-violating phases in the CKM matrix, so the SM has CP violation. So if SMEFT includes the SM, which already has CP violation, then SMEFT operators can have CP violation as well. So does that mean that SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the operators are constructed in a way that doesn't introduce new CP violation beyond what's in the SM. Or maybe SMEFT allows for CP violation as part of the operator expansion. Hmm,
