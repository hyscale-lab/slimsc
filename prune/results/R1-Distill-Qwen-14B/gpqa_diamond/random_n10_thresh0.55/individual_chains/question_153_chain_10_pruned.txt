Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? It's a conjugate addition, so the nucleophile adds to the beta carbon. 

Looking at the problem, there are three different reactions given, and I need to find the major products for each. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for (A), (B), and (C). Let me go through each reaction step by step.

First Reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile here because NaOEt is a base. In the Michael reaction, the enolate ion acts as the nucleophile. So, the enolate would form from dimethyl malonate. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor, the one with the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

When the enolate attacks the beta position of the acrylate, it should form a new carbon-carbon bond. The structure of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no, wait: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-... Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate group is CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but the substituent is at position 3, which is the middle carbon? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But where is the p-tolyl group attached? Oh, wait, maybe it's at the beta position. So maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, because the substituent is on the acrylate. So, if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, that can't be right because the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-position would be the end of the chain. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. But that
