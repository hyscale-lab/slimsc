Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere, so maybe this is a 2-dimensional surface?

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Like the tractricoid or something. But in this case, it's embedded in ... well, maybe it's a 2-dimensional space described by this metric.

Wait, the metric looks like it's in two dimensions because it only has dx² and dy². So it's probably a 2D manifold. And the question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, pseudospheres, or more accurately, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a "sphere" of radius r is 4πr² times some factor, but I think in hyperbolic space, it's different. Wait, no, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which is a pseudosphere) is 2πr² (coth(r) - 1), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the metric and see if it's a hyperbolic space. Let me write this metric down properly. The line element is:

ds² = [32 / (4
