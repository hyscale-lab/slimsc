Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

First, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (alpha = beta = gamma). In this case, each angle is 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance—oh, that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So the lattice constant a is 10 Angstroms. 

The interplanar distance for a crystal plane is given by the formula I think: d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something?). Wait, no, more accurately, the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt[(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (h^2)(2 - 3cosα) + (k^2)(2 - 3cosβ) + (l^2)(2 - 3cosγ)] / (something else?) Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up some terms here. Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic crystal is d_{hkl} = 1/sqrt( (h²/(a²)) + (k²/(b²)) + (l²/(c²)) - (2hk cosθ)/(ab) - (2hl cosφ)/(ac) - (2kl cosψ)/(bc) )) ), where θ, φ, ψ are the angles between the crystallographic axes. But for a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c, and all angles are equal, so maybe this simplifies.

Wait, I think the formula for a rhombohedral system is a bit simpler. Since all the sides are equal and the angles are the same, perhaps the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) ) * something... Or perhaps I'm getting the denominator wrong. Wait, I remember there's a formula involving the unit cell parameters and the plane indices. Oh right, the general formula is d = (a^2) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk)(cos α) - (hl)(cos β) - (kl)(cos γ) ) )^0.5. Wait, but since in rhombohedral, a = b = c and all angles are same, let's say alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So the denominator inside the sqrt would be: h² + k² + l² - hk cos α - hl cos β - kl cos gamma.

Wait, but since all those cosines are the same because all angles are 30°, the denominator becomes h² + k² + l² - hk*cos(30) - hl*cos(30) - kl*cos(30). Let's compute cos(30°), which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So the denominator becomes h² + k² + l² - [hk + hl + kl]*(sqrt(3)/2).

Now, for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1. So plugging in:

Denominator = (1 +1 +1) - [ (1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * (sqrt(3)/2) ].

That's 3 - [3 * (sqrt(3)/2)].

So denominator = 3 - (3*sqrt(3)/2) = 3[1 - (sqrt(3)/2)].

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 1 - 0.866 = 0.134. Then 3 * 0.134 ≈ 0.402. So denominator ≈ 0.402.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the interplanar distance can't be larger than the lattice parameter. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But in a rhombohedral system, the formula is more complicated because of the angles.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = [ (a^2) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ) ]^0.5, where θ is the angle between the axes (30 degrees in this case).

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1. So denominator becomes 3 - [3 * (sqrt(3)/2)].

Let me compute that:

Denominator = 3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3(1 - sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 1 - 0.866 = 0.134. Multiply by 3, denominator is 0.402.

So d = a / sqrt(0.402) = 10 / sqrt(0.402).

What's sqrt(0.402)? Let's calculate it. Well, sqrt(0.402) is approximately 0.634 because 0.63^2 is 0.3969, 0.634^2 = (0.63)^2 + 2*(0.63)*(0.004) + (0.004)^2 ≈ 0.3969 + 0.005184 + 0.000016 ≈ 0.402. So sqrt(0.402) is about 0.634.

So d ≈ 10 / 0.634 ≈ 15.74 Angstroms? That can't be right because the lattice parameter is 10 Angstroms. Wait, that would mean the interplanar distance is larger than the lattice parameter, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a plane spacing larger than the unit cell itself. So clearly, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait a second, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me think again about the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice. Another approach is to use the relation involving the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d^2 = a^2 (h² + k² + l² + 2 h k cos α + 2 h l cos β + 2 k l cos γ )^{-1}.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I should check the derivation. The interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) is given by 1/d^2 = (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - (2 h k cos γ)/(a b) - (2 h l cos β)/(a c) - (2 k l cos α)/(b c), where α, β, γ are the angles between the respective axes.

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30°. So substituting:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (2 h k cos α)/(a^2) - (2 h l cos β)/(a^2) - (2 k l cos gamma)/(a^2).

So this simplifies to:

1/d^2 = [h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α ] / a².

Since all angles are 30°, cos α is the same everywhere.

Thus, 1/d² = [h² + k² + l² - 2 cos α (hk + hl + kl)] / a².

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So numerator becomes 3 - 2 cos α (3) ) because hk + hl + kl = 3.

So 3 - 6 cos alpha.

Compute that: cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 3 - 6*(0.866) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. Oh, that can't be possible because 1/d^2 would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Hmm, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check the formula for 1/d^2.

Wait, another source says the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = [ a^2 / (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ]^0.5

But wait, that can't be right either, because for a cubic system, alpha is 90°, cos alpha is zero, and so d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the axes.

Wait, let me think about the Miller indices and the structure factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g = [ [ a^2, a b cos gamma, a c cos beta ],
       [ a b cos gamma, b^2, b c cos alpha ],
       [ a c cos beta, b c cos alpha, c^2 ] ]

In a rhombohedral system, a=b=c=a0, and alpha=beta=gamma=30°. So the metric tensor becomes:

g = [ [ a0², a0² cos 30, a0² cos 30 ],
       [ a0² cos 30, a0², a0² cos 30 ],
       [ a0² cos 30, a0² cos 30, a0² ] ]

The interplanar distance d for (hkl) is given by d = sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) a0² + 2 hk a0² cos 30 + 2 hl a0² cos 30 + 2 kl a0² cos30 ) )^{-1}.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct formula for d is the reciprocal of sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos gamma ), multiplied by a0, perhaps?

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + (2 h k cos gamma)/(a²) + (2 h l cos beta)/(a²) + (2 k l cos alpha)/(a²).

Wait, that can't be right because it would make 1/d² positive only under certain conditions. Let me think again.

Another angle: the formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

d = [ (a^2 (b^2 c^2)/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) ] ... No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal.

Wait, I found this formula online before: For a crystal with a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors (in this case, 30 degrees).

So, substituting for (111) plane:

d = 10 / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos30 )

Compute the denominator inside the sqrt:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1 +1 +1) =6.

Cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So denominator becomes 3 + 6*(0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is about sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Hmm, that's way off. So maybe I got the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, if I use that instead. Let's try that.

So denominator inside sqrt would be 3 - 6*(0.866).

3 - 5.196 = -2.196. That's negative, which can't be possible since we can't take sqrt of a negative number. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I should reverse the sign. Another thought: perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - hk*(cos(alpha)) - hl*(cos(beta)) - kl*(cos(gamma)) )

In rhombohedral, a=b=c and alpha=beta=gamma.

So denominator is h² +k² +l² - (hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha).

So for (111):

Denominator =3 - (3)*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 3 - 3*0.866 ≈3 -2.598=0.402.

So sqrt(0.402) ≈0.634.

So d=10 / 0.634 ≈15.74 Angstrom. But that's way bigger than a, which is 10, which seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula for d and its reciprocal. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is d = [ (a^2) / ( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma ) ]^0.5.

Wait, for (111):

Denominator =3 - 2*(1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30 )

Which is 3 - 2*3*(0.866) = 3 - 6*(0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative, which can't be. So that's not possible.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. In a rhombohedral system, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each with magnitude a, and the angles between them are 30 degrees.

The (111) plane is defined by the vectors a + b + c. The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this plane's normal vector.

Wait, no, the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. Hmm, perhaps that's the way to go.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is given by (h a^* + k b^* + l c^* ), where a^*, b^*, c^* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d for (hkl) is given by d = 2π / |G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

a^* = (2π/a) ( (1,0,0) - (cosβ)/(1 - cosα) (1,0,0) + ... ) but this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to compute the dot product of the lattice vectors.

Wait, another approach: The distance between adjacent planes is given by the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (hk + hl + kl)(2 cosθ) )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (sqrt(3)/2) )

Wait, but earlier that gave me a denominator of 0.402, leading to d ≈ 15.74, which is too large.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using unit vectors.

Let me model the vectors a, b, c in a rhombohedral system. Let's assume a is along the x-axis. Then, the vector a is (a, 0, 0).

Vector b is in the xy-plane and makes an angle of 30 degrees with a. So b = (a cos30, a sin30, 0).

Vector c has components (a cos30, 0, a sin30).

Wait, no, because in a rhombohedral system, all angles are 30 degrees, so the angle between a and c is 30 degrees, and the angle between b and c is also 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the lattice vectors.

Let me choose a coordinate system where a is along x, b is in the xy-plane, and c has components in x, y, z.

So:

a = (a, 0, 0)

b = (a cosθ, a sinθ, 0)

c = (a cosθ, 0, a sinθ )

Where θ is 30 degrees.

Wait, but in reality, the angle between a and c is 30 degrees, and the angle between b and c is also 30 degrees. So this setup may not capture that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the vectors as follows:

a = (a, 0, 0)

b = (a cosθ, a sinθ, 0)

c = (a cosθ, 0, a sinθ )

But then I'm not sure if the angle between b and c is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the scalar product between b and c to find the angle. The scalar product is b · c = (a cosθ)(a cosθ) + (a sinθ)(0) + (0)(a sinθ) )= a² cos²θ.

The magnitude of b is a√(cos²θ + sin²θ) )=a. The magnitude of c is a√(cos²θ + sin²θ) )=a.

So the scalar product is a² cos²θ. The angle between b and c is φ, where cosφ = (b · c)/(|b||c|) )= cos²θ.

So if θ is 30 degrees, cosφ = cos²30 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4=0.75 → φ ≈ 41.4 degrees. But the problem states that all angles are 30 degrees, so this approach might not be correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should choose a different coordinate system. Maybe let me define a, b, and c such that each makes a 30-degree angle with each other. But this might complicate the setup. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the (111) plane's interplanar distance using the reciprocal lattice.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a)(1, 0, 0) - something. Wait, perhaps the general formula is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters.

Wait, here's a reference formula I found: For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but earlier when I applied this, I got d ≈3.49 Angstroms, which is not matching any of the options. The options are all around 9 Angstroms.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But for (111), h=k=l=1, so denominator: 3 + 2*(3) cos(30) = 3 + 6*(√3/2) )= 3 + 3√3.

Compute that: 3 + 3*1.732 ≈ 3 +5.196 =8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d =10 / 2.863≈3.49 Angstroms. But the options given are way larger, so this can't be right. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )

So for our case, 3 - 3 * (sqrt(3)/2 )=3 -2.598=0.402.

So sqrt(0.402)=0.634. So d=10/0.634≈15.74 Angstroms. Still doesn't match options.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula for d and its reciprocal. Maybe it's 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + (hk + hl + kl) something.

Wait, another source says that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is calculated as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (hk + hl + kl) * (sqrt(3)/2) )

Wait, let me compute that. So denominator is 3 + (3)*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3 + (5.196/2)=3 +2.598=5.598.

sqrt(5.598)≈2.366. So d=10/2.366≈4.226 Angstroms. Still not matching any of the options.

Hmm, maybe I should try to find the correct formula elsewhere.

Wait, upon a quick search (in my mind), the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

So for (111), θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2≈0.866.

So denominator:3 + 2*(3)*0.866=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So d=10/2.863≈3.49. But none of the options are around 3.5.

Wait, the options are all around 9, so perhaps I've confused the formula. Maybe the formula is actually d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, let's try that. So denominator=3 - 2*(3)*0.866=3 -5.196= -2.196. Negative, which can't be right. So that's impossible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently, using vector calculations.

The (111) plane is defined by the plane equation h x + k y + l z = 1/d.

The normal vector to this plane is (h, k, l) in reciprocal space.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the unit vector perpendicular to the (111) plane and then find its magnitude.

Wait, the normal vector to the (111) plane in direct space is (a + b + c). So the interplanar distance d is the magnitude of this vector divided by sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance d is given by 2π divided by the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l).

The reciprocal lattice vector G is given by:

G = h a^* + k b^* + l c^*

Where a^*, b^*, c^* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal basis vectors can be expressed in terms of the direct basis vectors. But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is:

d = 1/√( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) ) ) * (2π/a)

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me try plugging in the numbers using a different approach.

Wait, another way to calculate d is using the formula:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/a² + (2hk cos gamma)/(a²) + (2hl cos beta)/(a²) + (2kl cos alpha)/(a²)

Wait, for rhombohedral, a=b=c, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so this simplifies to:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 ) / a²

So denominator is [h² +k² +l² + 2hk*(√3/2) + 2hl*(√3/2) + 2kl*(√3/2)] = h² +k² +l² + hk√3 + hl√3 + kl√3.

So for (111), h=k=l=1:

Denominator becomes 3 + √3*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1 )=3 + 3*1.732 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196/(10)^2 =8.196/100=0.08196.

So d=1/sqrt(0.08196) ≈1/0.2863≈3.49 Angstroms.

Again, same result as before. So why are the options in the 9-10 range? I must have a wrong formula.

Wait a moment, perhaps the interatomic distance is the lattice parameter a, but in the formula, I'm using a=10 Ang. So the d=3.49 is correct, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the interatomic distance being 10 Angstrom, but that's the distance between nearest atoms along a lattice direction. So a is 10 Angstrom, which is correct.

Hmm, but the options are way higher than that. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for d is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl +kl) * (sqrt(3)/2) )

So denominator is 3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2 )= 3 - 2.598=0.402.

So d=10/sqrt(0.402)=10/(0.634)=15.74 Angstroms. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) multiplied by some factor because of the angles.

Wait, in a cubic system (angles 90°), d= a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So for (111), d= a/√3 ≈10/1.732≈5.773 Angstroms.

But none of the options here are near that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111), denominator=3 -3=0 → division by zero. That can't be right.

Another approach: perhaps it's better to compute the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g_ij = a^2 [ δ_ij - cos α δ_ij ] ?

Wait, no. The correct metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

g = [ [ a², a² cos α, a² cos α ],
       [a² cos α, a², a² cos α ],
       [a² cos alpha, a² cos alpha, a² ] ]

So the reciprocal metric tensor g^(-1) will give the interplanar distances.

The (hkl) plane corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vector (h, k, l). The interplanar distance d is given by d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 hk cos alpha + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos gamma ), but in rhombohedral, cos alpha = cos beta = cos gamma = cos30.

So 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) + 2 hk cos30 + 2 hl cos30 + 2 kl cos30 all over a².

So 1/d² = [3 + 6*(√3/2)] / a² = [3 + 3√3]/(100).

So 1/d² = (3 +5.196)/100 =8.196/100=0.08196.

d²=1/0.08196≈12.2, so d≈3.49 Angstroms again.

Hmm, same as before. So perhaps the correct answer is 3.49 Angstroms, but the options don't have that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interplanar distance being the distance between adjacent planes along a certain direction, but I'm not considering that. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for d is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos theta ), but when theta is 60 degrees instead of 30. Wait, that would change the calculation.

Wait, cos60 is 0.5, so then denominator becomes 3 + 6*(0.5)=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449. d=10/2.449≈4.08 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the angle in the formula is 180-30=150 degrees, cos150= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

Then, denominator=3 + 6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Again negative.

Hmm, perhaps I'm completely off track here. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 9.08 Angstrom

B) 8.95 Angstrom

C) 9.54 Angstrom

D)10.05 Angstrom

All are close to 9 Angstrom. So perhaps the correct answer is around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, maybe the formula uses the inverse. Perhaps d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / ... something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance for (111) is a / sqrt(3(1 - cos α )).

So, 10 / sqrt(3*(1 - cos30 )) =10 / sqrt(3*(1 - (√3/2))).

Compute the denominator: 3*(1-0.866)=3*(0.134)=0.402. sqrt(0.402)=0.634. So d=10/0.634≈15.74 Angstroms. Still no.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of sqrt(3). Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk +hl +kl) cosθ )

Which for (111) would be 3 - 6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which for (111) is 3 + 6*(0.866)=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863. d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, perhaps that's the distance between nearest atoms, which is along a lattice direction, so a = 10 Angstrom, correct.

Wait, but if I'm getting 3.49 Angstroms, which isn't an option, maybe I should think of the (111) plane in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111), denominator=3-3=0, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + (hk + hl + kl) )

So denominator=3 +3=6, so d=10/√6≈4.08 Angstroms.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the structure factor approach, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an alternative formula or consider that I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (sqrt(3)/2) )

So denominator=3 -3*(0.866)=3-2.598=0.402. sqrt(0.402)=0.634, so d=10/0.634≈15.74 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) )

So denominator=3-3=0. Impossible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 180-30=150 degrees, but that would make cos(theta) negative, leading to a negative denominator.

I'm stuck. Let me try to see if any of the options make sense.

Option C is 9.54 Angstroms. Let me see what that would require.

If d=9.54, then 1/d²=1/(9.54)^2≈0.0112.

So 1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + ... ) / a².

So (h² +k² +l² + ... ) = a² * 0.0112 → 100 *0.0112=1.12.

So for (111), denominator=3 + sum_of_terms =1.12 → sum_of_terms= -1.88. Impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, if d=8.95 Angstroms (option B), then 1/d²=1/(8.95)^2≈0.0125.

a² * (denominator) =100 *0.0125=1.25.

So denominator=3 +6*(something) =1.25 → 6*(something)= -1.75 → something= -0.2917.

Which would imply cos(theta)=something/(2). So cos(theta)= -0.2917/(2) → about -0.1458. But the angle is 30 degrees, so that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong and I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * something.

Wait, but for a cubic system, d= a / sqrt(3) for (111). So 10/1.732≈5.77 Angstrom. None of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula for the (111) plane in a hexagonal system. Oh wait, no, the question is about rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, for (111), denominator=3 +6=9. So d=10/3≈3.333 Angstroms. Still doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt(3) + ... ), but I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / something. Let me think.

Wait, I'm stuck, but given that none of the options match the calculations I've done, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos(theta) )

Where theta is 60 degrees, not 30. Let's see: cos60=0.5.

Denominator=3 +6*(0.5)=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449. d=10/2.449≈4.08. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle to use is 60 degrees because in rhombohedral, the angle between the lattice vectors is 60 degrees. Wait, no, the problem states that alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, looking for an answer that would result in d being around 9 Angstroms.

Let me see: If d=9.08 Angstroms (option A), then 1/d²= approx 0.001218.

So (h² +k^2 +l^2 + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 ) = a² * 0.001218.

Wait, a=10, so a²=100.

So 100 * 0.001218 =0.1218.

But for (111), the sum is 3 +6*(0.866)=8.196. Which is way larger than 0.1218. So not possible.

Hmm, perhaps if I consider that the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos(60) )

Wait, for (111), denominator=3 -6*(0.5)=3-3=0. Can't be.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) )

So denominator=3-6= -3. No good.

Wait, perhaps the formula involves 2*cos(theta) in the denominator.

Wait, let me think: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos(theta)) )

Wait, for theta=30, 1 - cos(theta)=1-0.866=0.134.

So denominator=3 - 6*(0.134)=3 -0.804=2.196.

sqrt(2.196)=1.482. d=10/1.482≈6.73 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options provided, but I must choose from the given options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the volume of the unit cell and use it in the formula.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

But for alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees,

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 ) )

Wait, 3*(3/4)=9/4=2.25. 2*( (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )=2*(3√3)/(8) )= (3√3)/4≈1.299.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(1 -2.25 +1.299 )=a^3 sqrt( (1 +1.299) -2.25 )=a^3 sqrt(2.299-2.25)=a^3 sqrt(0.049)=a^3 *0.221.

So V=10^3 *0.221=2210 Ang^3.

But I'm not sure how this helps with the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula involving the volume is used in another way.

Wait, the volume of the reciprocal lattice cell is 1/V, but I'm not sure how to apply that here.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given that I can't find a formula that gives an answer in the options, perhaps the correct approach is to select the option closest to 3.49 Angstroms, but that's not any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct formula gives an answer around 9 Angstroms.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the unit cell is not primitive. Wait, rhombohedral systems can have a hexagonal close-packed structure, and in that case, perhaps the (111) plane corresponds to a different interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111):

denominator=3 -3=0. So d is undefined. Can't be.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula uses cos(180-30)=cos150= -sqrt(3)/2.

So, 1/d² = (3 +6*(-sqrt(3)/2)) / 100.

3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Negative again. No good.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Given that none of the formulas I've tried give an answer matching the options, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, another thought: maybe the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system is given by a * sqrt(3) / (3 * something).

Wait, for a cubic system, (111) plane has d= a/√3. For a=10, d≈5.77. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Angstroms. Let me see what that would require.

If d=9.54, then 1/d²≈0.00113.

So, (h² +k^2 +l^2 + 2hk cos30 + 2hl cos30 + 2kl cos30 )=a² *0.00113=100 *0.00113=0.113.

But for (111):

3 +6*(0.866)=8.196. Which is way larger than 0.113. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the reciprocal. Let me think: perhaps 1/d² = [ ... ] / a². So if 1/d²= [ ... ] / a², then [ ... ] = 100 *1/d².

For option A, d=9.08:

1/d²=(1/9.08)^2≈0.001218.

So [ ... ]=0.001218*100=0.1218.

But for (111), [ ... ]=8.196, so 0.1218 is way less than that. So not possible.

Hmm, I'm really not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that I'm making a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option C, 9.54 Angstroms.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) ) ).

So for (111), denominator=3 +6=9. sqrt(9)=3. d=10/3≈3.333 Angstroms. Not matching.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k^2 +l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos(60) )

So cos60=0.5.

Denominator=3 -6*(0.5)=3-3=0. So d is undefined.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k^2 +l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos(theta) )

With theta=60.

So denominator=3 -6*(0.5)=0. No good.

Wait, theta=30 degrees.

Denominator=3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Negative, impossible.

Hmm.

Well, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Despite my best efforts, I can't find a formula that gives an answer matching the options. But based on the calculations I did earlier, the correct interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system with a=10 Ang and angles 30 degrees should be approximately 3.49 Angstroms. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 9.54 Angstroms, but I'm not sure how that would be derived.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct denominator is 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) )=3 + 5.196=8.196. So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the question intended to present a cubic system instead of rhombohedral, which would make d=10/sqrt(3)≈5.77 Angstroms. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question swapped a and d somewhere. Hmm.

Well, given that I've spent a lot of time and can't find a plausible option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 9.54 Angstroms. But I'm not confident.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - (hk + hl + kl) \cos\alpha}}
\]

### Step 1: Substituting the values
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \). Substituting these values:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - (1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos(30^\circ)}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the denominator
\[
\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

The denominator becomes:
\[
\sqrt{3 - 3 \cdot 0.866} = \sqrt{3 - 2.598} = \sqrt{0.402} \approx 0.634
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( d \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{0.634} \approx 15.74 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the result
The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 15.74 \, \text{Å} \) is significantly larger than the lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \), which is physically inconsistent. This suggests a possible error in the formula or interpretation of the problem. However, none of the provided options match this result.

### Step 5: Evaluate the options
The options provided are:
- **A)** \( 9.08 \, \text{Å} \)
- **B)** \( 8.95 \, \text{Å} \)
- **C)** \( 9.54 \, \text{Å} \)
- **D)** \( 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)

All options are close to \( 9 \, \text{Å} \), which is much smaller than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with the formula or the problem setup. Given the mismatch, the closest plausible answer based on the options is **C) \( 9.54 \, \text{Å} \)**, though the reasoning behind this value remains unclear.

### Final Answer
**Answer: C**
