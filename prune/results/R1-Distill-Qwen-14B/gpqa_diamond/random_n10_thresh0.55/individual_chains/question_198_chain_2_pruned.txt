Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants, beta, tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D. Let me think about what I know.

So, the solution has Co(II) and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait—what do these betas correspond to? Oh right, each beta usually corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2- maybe? Or wait, sometimes the order is different. I might have to think about that.

Wait, no, the order depends on the number of ligands. So:

β1 is for the first complex, which would have one SCN ligand. The formula would be Co(SCN)^+. So, the charge would be +1 because Co^2+ plus one SCN^- (charge -1) gives overall charge +1.

β2 would be for [Co(SCN)₂]^0. Because each SCN is -1, two of them would be -2. So Co^2+ plus 2 SCN^- gives Co(SCN)₂^0.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. The general formula for the complex is [CoL_n]^{m}, where L is the ligand. So for each SCN^-, which is -1, adding n of them would give a charge of m = Co^2+ + n*(-1).

So for n=1, m= +1: [CoSCN]^+ is the first complex with beta1=9.

n=2: m= 2-2=0 → [Co(SCN)₂]^0, beta2=40.

n=3: m=2-3= -1 → [Co(SCN)3]^-.

n=4: m=
