Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. Let me write it down. So, it's cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent on the first carbon. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, maybe it's like a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (probably carbon 1) has two substituents: a hydroxymethyl (which is -CH(OH)-) and another cyclohexyl group. Or perhaps it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde ring. Either way, I think the main steps would involve adding groups and then modifying them.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, I think. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a substituent of CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a substituent of C≡C-
