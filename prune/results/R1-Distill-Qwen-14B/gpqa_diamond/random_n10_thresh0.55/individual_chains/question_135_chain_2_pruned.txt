Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by a certain Lagrangian. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the allowed decays at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

Wait, so X is a boson, and it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The Lagrangian term is L(y) = -λ f Ψ̄ f (y)(υ + X(y)) Ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I should parse this.

So the interaction term probably involves X coupling to fermions. The structure looks like maybe Yukawa coupling or something similar. The term is like X times the product of the fermion fields. So the interaction would be something like X ψ ψ̄ or similar.

Decay processes for X would require that X can couple to a fermion pair. The possible decays are into pairs of fermions (like quarks, leptons, etc.), as long as the energy is sufficient.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So the decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because E=Mc², right? So the rest mass of the decay products must be less than X's mass.

Wait, no, wait.
