Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The products of this reaction are to be determined based on the given IR and NMR data.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. The IR and NMR data provided will help in determining its structure.

Looking at the IR data:
- The broad peak between 3400â€“2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of either an alcohol (-OH) or an amine. But more likely an alcohol because the peak is broad and in that region.
- The peak at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. 
- Peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are typical for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound has an aromatic ring.

Now, the 1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is probably an acidic proton, like an -OH group. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm as sharp singlets. But since it's broad and at 10.5, it's more likely an -OH, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The downfield shift (8.0) suggests substitution on the benzene ring. The doublets each with 2H indicate a para-substituted benzene. So, two substituents at opposite positions. For example, if it's a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, like two methyl groups or a substituent and a carbonyl group.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a methine (CH) group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like a ketone or ester. Or perhaps a CH group in a chain next to an oxygen.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, possibly two adjacent CH2 groups, maybe part of a chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, maybe a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 or another group. Like a CH(CH3) group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a terminal methyl group, like part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and a chain leading to a CH(CH2CH2CH3) or similar.

Wait, let me think about the IR. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, but that's similar. But wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3
