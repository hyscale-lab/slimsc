Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about any kinetic energy or mass-related stuff in the calculations.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D, some in 10^-26 and others in 10^-27, except option D which is way bigger.

Hmm, so I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when charges are placed in space, they have potential energy due to their positions relative to each other. Since the system is isolated, I can assume that all interactions contribute to the total potential energy.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let me think about the setup. There's a fixed charge at point P, and twelve other charges each at 2 meters from P. So, each of those 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge, which is fixed at P.

So, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, I need to be careful
