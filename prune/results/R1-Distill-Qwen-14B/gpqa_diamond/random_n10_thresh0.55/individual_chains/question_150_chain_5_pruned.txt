Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's an important starting point. The NMR data is given, and a series of reactions is performed on this compound. I need to find out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let's break down the molecular formula. C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Wait, wait, the formula is C8H9NO, so N is 1. So substituting, we have (18 +2 -9 +1)/2? Wait wait, let me recalculate. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So:

C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So: (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5.

So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from, say, a benzene ring (which is 3) plus an aldehyde (1), and a double bond (1), or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group.

6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That might be aromatic protons. The fact that it's a doublet could indicate substitution on the benzene ring, perhaps para to another substituent.

6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Also a doublet. Maybe these are ortho to substituents or part of a conjugated system.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad signals are often from protons that are exchanging, like OH groups. But wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe two phenolic OH groups? Or maybe it's something else like CH2 groups,
