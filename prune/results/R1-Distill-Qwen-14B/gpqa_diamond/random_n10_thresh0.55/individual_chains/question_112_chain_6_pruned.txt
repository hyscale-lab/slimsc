Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, this is a two-level system, probably spin-½. The problem is asking for two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, and the average value of that operator.

The operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, let's think. For a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2. So, when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Is that right? Yeah, because (1,2) and (2,1) are different from (1,1) and (2,2). So, it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, what operator has such a matrix? Oh, this looks like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by (hbar/2), right? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply by hbar/2, we get the matrix A.
