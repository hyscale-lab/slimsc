Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The options are four different values, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal structure? Oh right, rhombohedral means that all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are equal too. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in this case would be the edge length of the unit cell since it's a primitive lattice. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice is primitive, so the interatomic distance 'a' is the edge length. So a is 10 Angstroms here.

The interplanar distance for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by the formula 1/d = sqrt[(h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)]/(a²). Or wait, another way. Oh right, I remember the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (but in this case, a=b=c because it's rhombohedral), and angles α, β, γ.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance (d_hkl) is:

1/d² =
