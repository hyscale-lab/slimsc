Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see... The question is about identifying a final product after a reaction. Hmm, the compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI (Hydrogen Iodide) acid catalyzed reaction, often for some kind of elimination or substitution. Wait, or maybe it's a type of cleavage reaction?

Looking at the IR and NMR data first to figure out what compound X is. The IR data shows peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H stretching. There are other peaks at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 peak suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester. The 1610 and 1450 might be aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably a benzene ring involved.

Now the NMR. The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet, which is likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid or a phenol. But wait, phenol protons are usually around 5-6 ppm, so 10.5 might be a carboxylic acid. Oh, but sometimes aldehyde protons are around 9-10, but that's a singlet. Wait, an aldehyde is around 9-10, but maybe this is a carboxylic acid. So if there's a carbonyl at 1720, that would fit a carboxylic acid (since their carbonyls are around 1700). Hmm, but wait, the 10.5 peak is broad, which is more typical of an acid than an aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually sharp singlets around 9-10 ppm.

Looking further, there's a doublet at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and another at 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like two sets of two protons each, in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Let me think, the 8.0 and 7.2 could be two doublets, which would suggest a para-dichlorobenzene structure, but in this case, it
