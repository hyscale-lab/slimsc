Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each part carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps, each with different reagents, so I need to track each transformation.

First, let's outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination to form compound E.

Plus, there are some hints provided:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, produces 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b) IR spectra: A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has one around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are all cyclic ketones (they end with "-one"), so E is a ketone. Let's think about each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So A must have a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. Wait, but HCN addition can form different products depending on the conditions. Alternatively, if A is a cycloketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. So B is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Wait, let me think: HCN adds to the carbonyl group of a ketone. The mechanism is nucleophilic addition. The H+ from HCN would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl C more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, forming a new bond. The oxygen then gets a negative charge, which picks up a proton to form an alcohol.

So in B, the structure would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent to each other, right? So if A is a cycloketone, B would have an -OH and -CN on adjacent carbons.

Then, step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.

Hydrogenation with Pd is usually for reducing triple bonds or maybe ketones, but wait, B is a cyanohydrin. The groups in B are an alcohol and a nitrile. So, when B is hydrogenated, what happens? Hmm. I think hydrogenation of a nitrile (CN) group would convert it into an amine, but wait, no, that's under different conditions. Wait, H2 with Pd usually is for hydrogenating triple bonds to single bonds. Oh wait, but in B, the nitrile is R-CN. Wait, maybe Pd isn't the catalyst used for nitrile hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the alcohol in B is being deprotonated and then hydrogenated? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile group is being reduced. Let me think: Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines under certain conditions, but that usually uses Raney Ni or other catalysts, maybe under high pressure. But here,
