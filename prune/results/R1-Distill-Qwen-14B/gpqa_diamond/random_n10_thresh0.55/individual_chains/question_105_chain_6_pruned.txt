Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about stars with spots and how their brightness variations can mimic an exoplanet. Interesting. I remember that stars with spots can cause dips in brightness when they rotate, and sometimes it's mistaken for a planet transiting the star. So the question is essentially asking, if a star has these spots, what would be the radius of a planet needed to cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do?

Alright, let me break down the problem. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star = R_sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. Wait, wait, the filling factor is 20%? I think the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is 20% covered, that's like 0.2 of the star's surface in one hemisphere. But wait, the star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR². But since the spots are on one hemisphere, the total spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² (because a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere). Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. Wait, no, actually, maybe I should think about it differently. The star's total surface area is 4πR². If the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, that's 0.2*(2πR²) = 0.4π
