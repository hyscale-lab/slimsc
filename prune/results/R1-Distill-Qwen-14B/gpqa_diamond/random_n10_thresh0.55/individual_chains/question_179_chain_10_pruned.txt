Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to matrices and quantum stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are statements about these matrices, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to understand each option.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the evolution operator (like e^(-iHt/ħ)) must be unitary to preserve the norm of the quantum state. So if e^X is not unitary, then multiplying a vector by it would change the norm. So I need to check if e^X is unitary.

But wait, how do I determine if a matrix is unitary? A matrix U is unitary if U*U† = I, where U† is the conjugate transpose. Alternatively, for any vector v, the norm is preserved if U is unitary. So if e^X is not unitary, then option A would be correct.

But wait, what about the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix? Because the time evolution operator is usually e^{-iHt}, where H is Hermitian. Anti-Hermitian matrices have the property that (X)† = -X. So if X is anti-Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary.

Let me check if X is anti-Hermitian. X is given as:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

First, compute X†, the conjugate transpose. So the rows become columns, and each element is conjugated.

X† would be:

First element (1,1) is i*, which is -i. Wait, wait: wait, the first row of X is [i, -1, 2i], so the first column of X† is [i*, 1*, 2i*], which is [-i, 1, -2i].

Wait, let me write X to find X†:

X matrix:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X† is:

Column 1: i*, 1*, (2i)* → -i, 1, -2i
Column 2: (-1)*, 0*, (-1)* → -1, 0, -1
Column 3: (2i)*, 1*, (-i)* → -2i, 1, i

So X† is:

[ -i    -1     -2i ]
  1     0      1
  -2i   -1      i ]

Wait, no. Wait, the first column is [i*, 1*, 2i*]. Wait, wait, the original X is:

Element (1,1)=i, (1,
