Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and there's a point P outside the conductor, at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both larger than R. The angle between l and s is theta. Got it.

So the setup: a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field at point P. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out step by step.

First, I remember that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So what happens when you place a charge inside the cavity?

Oh right, the cavity is not touching the conductor's outer surface because it's a conductor with a cavity. So the charge +q inside the cavity would cause the electrons in the conductor to rearrange. The inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface
