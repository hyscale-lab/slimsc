Okay, so I've got this question here about different physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations which aren't physically meaningful. Regularization introduces a temporary "cutoff" or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then you take the cutoff away in a controlled way. It's a way to handle the divergences so you can compute meaningful results.

So, the question is about which theory doesn't need this process. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. String theory is a quantum theory of gravity and other fundamental forces, right? It's a candidate for a theory of everything. I think string theories are supposed to be finite or at least not require the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. Because in string theory, particles are replaced by strings, and the interactions are at the string level, so maybe they don't have the same loop divergences as, say, QED or QCD. Or wait, maybe they do have some issues but they're handled differently, like through the concept of higher-dimensional aspects or other mechanisms. If string theory works at all energy scales, perhaps it doesn't need regularization. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, right? It's a non-abelian gauge theory with SU(3) symmetry. I remember that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, where the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies. But when you calculate things like loop diagrams, you get divergences. So QCD definitely requires regularization, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization, to handle those infinities. So B would require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, quantum mechanically. It's a well-tested theory. But in QED, when you calculate loop diagrams, especially for processes like electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. These require regularization to make sense of the calculations. So QED definitely needs regularization. So option C requires it.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version, Maxwell's equations and all that. In classical theory, you don't have the same kind of divergences that come up in quantum theories. Wait, but do you ever get infinities in classical calculations? Like, for example, the electric field of a point charge is infinite at the origin, but that's more of a mathematical issue rather than a calculational divergence. But in the context of regularization, which is a quantum field theory technique, classical theories don't require it. Because regularization is about handling divergent integrals in perturbative expansions. So classical electrodynamics doesn't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So perhaps option D is the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about whether the theory ever requires regularization. So which of these theories don't require it at any
