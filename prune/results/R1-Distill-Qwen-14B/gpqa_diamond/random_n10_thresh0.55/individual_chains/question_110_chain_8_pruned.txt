Okay, let's try to tackle this question. Hmm, so the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I remember that ESPRESSO is at Paranal Observatory, which uses the VLT, and HIRES is at Keck. I think both are high-resolution spectrographs, but their brightness limits are different.

The problem gives some info: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning anything up to 17, like V ≤17. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V ≤16. Wait, no, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, that means its apparent V is ≤17. Similarly, for HIRES, stars must have apparent V ≤16.

So the goal is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES), but since both need to detect, the star must be within the more restrictive limit, which is the lower number. Wait, no, because if a star is brighter than 17 mag (which is dimmer than 17), it's observable by ESPRESSO. Hmm, maybe I should rephrase: ESPRESSO can detect stars with apparent V up to 17, so V ≤17. HIRES can detect up to 16, so V ≤16. So for a star to
