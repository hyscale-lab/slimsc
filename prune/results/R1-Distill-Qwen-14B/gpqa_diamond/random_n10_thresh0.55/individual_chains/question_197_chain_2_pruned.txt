Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when an organic compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's typically undergoing a substitution reaction, maybe a hydrolysis or something involving elimination. Wait, wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, but more commonly, I think they're used in the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. Or wait, no, another reaction—maybe it's something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of allylic halides to form alkenes or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where an ester or a nitrile is being converted. Hmm, maybe I should look at the spectral data first.

The IR data for Compound X shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since in the options, the products don't have O-H except for options A and C. Wait, no, looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: that's a carboxylic acid, so it would have an O-H stretch around 2500-3300, maybe a broad peak.

C) 4
