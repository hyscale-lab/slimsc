Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So the question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its close analog is also a reagent, so I'm thinking maybe it's something like a strong base or a common reagent.

Hmm, let me list out the clues again to organize them.

1. Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is probably an element with isotopes, maybe an element that has multiple common isotopes.

2. Reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W. What liquids react violently with certain substances? Maybe metals reacting with acids, but Y is a liquid. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a reaction like a metal with water or another liquid?

3. Gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is probably something like H2O (but wait, H has 0 neutrons), no. Or maybe something else. Wait, the proton and neutron counts in the molecule have to be the same. So each molecule has as many protons as neutrons overall.

Wait, gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So if it's a molecule like CO2, that's not right. Let me think. For example, O2: each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (in the common isotope). So each O has 8n and 8p. So O2 would have 16p and 16n in the molecule. So yes, same number. So O2 is a possibility. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: H2O has H's protons (1 each) and O with 8. So each H2O molecule has 2 H (2p) and O (8p and 8n). Total p: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 8. Not same. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe
