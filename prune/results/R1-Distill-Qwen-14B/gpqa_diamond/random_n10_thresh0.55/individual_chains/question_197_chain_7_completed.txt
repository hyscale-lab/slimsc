Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying a final product after a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The options are A to D. I have the IR and NMR data for Compound X, so I need to figure out what Compound X is first, and then determine what it becomes after the reaction.

Let me start by looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe an alkyne. But wait, the peak is in that range, so it's broad, probably O-H. Another peak at 1720 cm-1—this is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. What about 1610 and 1450 cm-1? Those might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting this together, the compound probably has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. Also, an O-H group. So maybe it's a phenol or a carboxylic acid, or maybe an ester or something else.

Looking at the NMR data now. The peaks are as follows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. If it were a phenol, the OH would usually be around 5 ppm, but this is much higher, so maybe a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps an aldehyde proton, but that's around 9-10 ppm as a triplet or something else. But wait, 10.5 is high for aldehydes, but in this case, since it's a broad singlet, more likely a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is an acidic proton, like a phenol. But phenol OH is usually broader and around 5-7 ppm. Alternatively, if it's an enol tautomer, but that's something else. Hmm.

The next peak is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), which is likely aromatic protons. Then 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), another set of aromatic protons. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is typical for a para-disubstituted benzene. So, benzene ring with substituents in para positions.

Then 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), a multiplet integrating to one proton. That could be a CH in a branched chain, like in an isobutyl group. Next, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which might be another CH2 group adjacent to a branch. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)—a triplet of 3H, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH which is itself attached to something else. Like a CH(CH2CH3) group or similar. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a terminal methyl group, probably at the end of an ethyl or propyl chain.

So putting that together. Let's try to sketch the structure.

The aromatic part is para-substituted. Let's say positions 1 and 4 have substituents. One substituent is probably a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720 cm-1). The other substituent is a branched alkyl group, maybe isobutyl or something similar.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) suggests electron-withdrawing groups. A carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid or ester, would de-shield the aromatic protons. So if it's a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group (like a COOH) and another substituent.

Wait, the IR has 3400-2500 cm-1—a broad peak, which could be O-H. If the compound is a benzoic acid, then the O-H stretch would be around 2500-3300 cm-1, but for a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 2500-3300. So that fits. So maybe Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid.

Now, the substituent on the benzene ring. The NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm, a CH2 at 1.7, and a methyl at 1.4 and 0.9. Let's see: the 1.4 ppm is a doublet integrating to 3H, which is typical of a methyl group attached to a CH (like CH(CH3)). The 0.9 t is a triplet, which would correspond to the terminal methyl of an ethyl group. But wait, how does that connect?

Wait, let's think of the substituent. Suppose the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group of some sort.

Wait, the CH at 2.9 is a multiplet, perhaps a CH that's adjacent to branching. Let me think about the structure. If the substituent is an isobutyl group, then the structure would be:

Ph–COOH and Ph–CH(CH2CH3)2? Or wait, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group but with another chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) group? No, that doesn’t make sense.

Wait, the NMR suggests:

At 2.9 ppm: 1H, which is a CH that's connected to two other CH2 groups or something. The 1.7 is 2H (maybe CH2), and 1.4 is 3H (CH3), and 0.9 is 3H (another CH3). So, let's arrange this.

Let me think of a chain: -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's too long. Or perhaps a substituent where there's a CH attached to another CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2 or maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2-?

Wait, isobutyl group is (CH2CH(CH3)2). Hmm, perhaps.

But wait, looking at the NMR:

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests that the CH3 is at the end of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent is CH2CH2CH3, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's see: if it's a CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3. Hmm, that would be a pentyl group but branched.

Wait, let's think in terms of the splitting. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, so perhaps part of a CH group that's adjacent to another CH2. The 1.7 is 2H, so that's a CH2 group. The 1.4 is a CH3 attached to a CH, and the 0.9 is a CH3 attached to a CH2.

So perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 3-pentyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think. The substituent is –CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3. Wait no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, no, wait, sec-butyl is (CH2)2CH(CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let's think of the substituent as a (CH2CH2CH3) group attached to a CH, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let me try to build the structure.

The substituent on the benzene ring is a group where the chain has a branch. Let me consider the substituent as –CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's too long.

Wait, maybe it's a 3-methylbutyl group. So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group connected to an ethyl chain. Hmm.

Wait another approach. Let's consider the substituent as a (CH2CH(CH3)2) group. Wait, that's an isopropyl group attached to a CH2. So the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Is that possible?

So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Let me see if that fits the NMR.

The CH(CH3)2 would have a CH group. The CH group would be at around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (since it's next to two CH groups? Or maybe the CH group is adjacent to two CH2 groups, which would split it into a multiplet).

Wait, the substituent would look like this: benzene ring has a substituent at para position, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So, the group is CH2 attached to a CH(CH3)2.

Wait, so the structure would be benzene with a COOH group at one para position and a (CH2)CH(CH3)2 group at the opposite position.

So, the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group? Wait, 2-methylpropyl would be the same as isobutyl. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, substituent is isobutyl.

So, the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the other substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at the para position.

So the structure would be para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid and an isobutyl group.

So, the compound is 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but let me check the NMR again.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets, each 2H. That makes sense for a para-substituted benzene. Then the substituent's protons are as follows:

The isobutyl group has a CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the carbon chain is:

Benzen ring – CH2 – CH(CH3)2.

The protons on the CH(CH3)2 would be a CH group (the one connecting to the CH2 and the two CH3 groups). The CH protons would be split into a multiplet. The two CH3 groups attached to the CH would each be as a singlet or something else. Wait, but in the NMR, I see a 1.4 ppm (d,3H), which is a doublet, and a 0.9 (t,3H). Hmm, that suggests a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, so perhaps the NMR is showing different.

Wait, maybe I got the substituent wrong. Let me think again.

Let me outline the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm: 1H (broad singlet) → likely a carboxylic acid proton.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic, para to substituent perhaps.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic, other para position.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH in a chain.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group.
- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal CH3.

Wait, this looks like a chain that's -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? But then the 0.9 would be the end CH3, the 1.7 would be the CH2 next to it, and 1.4 would be a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, that would make the substituent as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's not right. Let me count. The substituent would be a pentyl group with branching, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: let's think of the substituent as an ethyl group attached to a CH which is connected to a methyl group. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Such as -(CH2)CH(CH3)-. Wait, but that would give:

The substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)-. Then, the CH(CH3) would have a CH group with adjacent CH2 groups.

But looking at the NMR, the CH is at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, which suggests it's next to other CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm is a CH2, and 1.4 is a CH3 attached to CH. The 0.9 is a CH3 at the end.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group, but that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Let me see:

Ph–COOH and Ph–(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch.

But then the protons on the CH(CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, the adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7, and the CH3 would be at 1.4 as a doublet. Wait, the 1.4 is a doublet, which would suggest that it's attached to a CH2 group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)CH(CH3)2 group. That would be isobutyl.

Wait, so substituent is isobutyl: CH2CH(CH3)2. So the chain is benzene ring → CH2 → CH(CH3)2.

Then the protons on the CH(CH3)2 would be a CH group. The CH is connected to two CH3 groups and a CH2.

So, the CH would be a singlet if all the neighboring groups are identical, but in reality, it's a multiplet. At 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (m), integrating to 1H.

The two CH3 groups attached to the CH would each be as singlets, but in the NMR, I don't see peaks that match. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests it's a –CH2CH2CH3 group. So the substituent has a CH2CH2CH3 end.

But we also have a 1.4 ppm as a doublet (3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH.

So, putting it together, the substituent is –CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, substituent is –CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group. So, it's –CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2–? No, maybe.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the IR data again. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which in a benzoic acid would be the C=O of the acid. So the compound is a benzoic acid with substituents.

So the structure would be something like:

Ph–COOH and another substituent at the para position.

Now, the substituent's structure must account for the NMR signals.

Let me try to build the substituent step by step.

Starting from the benzene ring:

Positions 1 and 4 have substituents: COOH at position 1 and R at position 4.

The R group has the following NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a CH group adjacent to other CH2 groups.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): adjacent to the CH? So perhaps a CH2 connected to the CH and another CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH3 at the end of a CH2.

So, the substituent might be a chain like:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, substituent is a 3-methylpentyl group? Or maybe it's a 4-methylpentyl?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group. Then, the structure would be (CH3)3C-CH2- attached to the benzene.

But then the NMR would have a singlet for the (CH3)3C group, but here, the signals are split into multiplets and triplets. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, if substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)2, then the CH is connected to the benzene via CH2, and then attached to two CH3 groups and another CH2.

So, substituent:

Ph–CH2–CH(CH3)2.

Then, the CH group (CH(CH3)2) would have a CH at 2.9 ppm (m), the two CH3 groups would be at lower ppm, but in the NMR, I don't see peaks around 1.0 ppm except the 0.9 t (3H), which would be the end of a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). That could be a CH2 group adjacent to the CH at 2.9. So, the substituent could be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. But that seems to complicate.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. But I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about that.

A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So, substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

But then the substituent would have a CH connected to a CH2 and a CH2CH3.

So, the NMR would show:

CH group at 2.9 (m, 1H).

The CH2 next to the benzene (CH2) would be at higher ppm, say around 1.7 as a quartet or something. But in our NMR, 1.7 is a multiplet for 2H. Perhaps that's the CH2 attached to the CH.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–.

Wait, that's a 2-methylpropyl group, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

Another approach: the IR has a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. In benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, but it can be higher if there's electron withdrawal. So that fits.

The broad peak at 10.5 is likely the COOH O-H.

So, the structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent group R at the para position.

The R group must provide the NMR signals for 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which suggests it's at the end of a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent has a –CH2CH2CH3 end.

Then, the other part of the substituent is a CH connected to a CH3 and a CH2. So, substituent is –CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a methyl branch. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. No, that's too long.

Alternatively, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 is a 3-methylbutyl group.

So, structure would be para to COOH, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but let me check the NMR.

The substituent would be:

Ph–COOH and Ph–(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the substituent's structure is CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2CH3.

So, the protons would be as follows:

The CH(CH3) would have a CH group (1H) at 2.9 ppm (m). The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3) would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH3 attached to CH is at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). The terminal CH2CH3 would have the CH2 at around 1.7 and the CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Wait, but that would mean the CH2 next to the benzene would be at 1.7 ppm, and the CH2 adjacent to the CH would also be at 1.7. Hmm, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 2H. So perhaps it's a single CH2 group.

Alternatively, the structure could be Ph–COOH and Ph–CH(CH2CH2CH3)2. Wait, that would give a CH group connected to two CH2CH2CH3 groups, but that seems unlikely as it would have more protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(isobutyl) group. Let me think.

Isobutyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

So, substituent is Ph–(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). The two CH3 groups attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H each?), but wait, in the NMR, 1.4 is a doublet for 3H. So maybe one CH3 is attached to the CH, and another group is attached.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have a 1.4 (d,3H) and a 0.9 (t,3H). So perhaps the substituent is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group.

So, the structure is 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid.

So, the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group, which has the structure CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, but in the substituent, the chain would be:

Ph–(CH2)–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3.

No, that's a longer chain. Wait, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's too long. Maybe substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, let's see:

- The CH group (CH(CH3)CH2CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).
- The adjacent CH2 (from CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3) would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H), but wait, no, because the CH(CH3)CH2CH3 has a CH3 attached to the CH, which would split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH2, but in the NMR, it's a doublet, so perhaps it's attached to a CH that's not adjacent to another CH2. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, that would be a different structure.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So, what is this reaction?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HWE (Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons) reaction, but more commonly, red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of ylides. Wait, no, another reaction comes to mind: the hydrolysis of a nitrile or perhaps the reaction of an acid chloride.

Wait, wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Alternatively, HI can be a source of iodide ions. Wait, another possibility is that Compound X is an ester, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a transesterification, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If Compound X is an acyl chloride, then reaction with HI could lead to substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If Compound X has a leaving group, like a tosylate or a chloride, then HI can act as a nucleophile.

But earlier, the IR and NMR suggested that Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. So, if X is a benzoic acid, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the preparation of the ylide, which is used in the Wittig reaction. Alternatively, red phosphorus can be used in the deoxygenation of ketones to alkanes, but that's with H2.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a reduction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, I think I might be mixing up reactions. Red phosphorus is used in the preparation of ylides when reacted with alkyl halides and a base, but in this case, it's reacted with HI. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. For example, if X is an acyl chloride, adding HI would replace the chloride with iodide, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's the same as the structure I was considering earlier, but option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a xylene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have a phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid at position 2, but the NMR doesn’t seem to match that.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which would be cumene with an isobutyl and a methyl group, but that doesn't fit the IR of a carboxylic acid.

So, given that, the reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. If X is a benzoic acid derivative, what would the product be?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a chloride is replaced by iodide, but X's structure doesn't have a chloride.

Wait, another possibility is that Compound X is an ester, and the reaction with HI would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps, the reaction is a cleavage of an ester.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show an ester peak around 1740 cm-1. It's at 1720, which could be a carboxylic acid or an ester with electron-withdrawing groups.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the acid is converted to an acid iodide.

Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid, and it's treated with HI, perhaps it would not react, as HI is a weaker base than hydroxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acyl chloride, and HI is acting as a nucleophile, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group (like a tosylate) is replaced by iodide. But again, the NMR doesn't indicate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's less likely with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol. But then, the product would be a benzyl alcohol derivative, which may not fit the options.

Alternatively, another possibility: if X is a nitrile, HI and red phosphorus could hydrolyze it to an amine, but again, the options don't suggest that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the synthesis of alkenes via the Wittig reaction. The ylide is generated from an alkyl halide and triphenylphosphine, but here we have HI, so perhaps it's the formation of a ylide from an alkyl iodide.

Wait, but if X is an aldehyde or ketone, the Wittig reaction would form an alkene. But from the NMR, I don't see any aldehyde protons.

Alternatively, maybe X is an ester, and the ylide would form an alkene upon reaction.

But perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me try to figure out what the product is.

If the reaction is a Wittig reaction, then the product would be an alkene. Looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, which is not an alkene. Option A is a propanoic acid. Option D is a substituted benzene, which is an alkene? Or perhaps, the reaction is leading to a substitution of a leaving group with iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is cleaving an ester to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.

Wait, if X is an ester, R-O-CO-Ar, then reaction with HI could lead to hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product options don't include any alkenes, so maybe the reaction is a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzoyl chloride, and the reaction with HI would substitute Cl with I, giving benzoyl iodide. But the options don't show that.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a condensation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution where X is an acid chloride, and HI substitutes the chloride with iodide.

But I'm not making progress on the reaction. Let me think again about what Compound X is.

Based on the NMR and IR data, X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent R at the para position. The substituent R has the following features: a CH at 2.9 (1H), a CH2 at 1.7 (2H), a CH3 at 1.4 (3H, d), and a CH3 at 0.9 (3H, t). So, R is a group that has a chain ending with CH3 and a methyl branch.

The substituent R is probably a 3-methylbutyl group. So, R is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's too long.

Wait, perhaps R is a (CH2)CH(CH3)2 group. That would be isobutyl.

Wait, isobutyl substituent would have the CH at 2.9, and the two CH3 groups at the same carbon. So, the NMR would show a singlet for the two CH3 groups, but in the data, I see a 1.4 ppm (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H). So, perhaps substituent is longer.

Wait, perhaps R is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So, substituent is 3-methylbutyl (CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3). So, the CH is at 2.9, the adjacent CH2 is at 1.7, the CH3 attached to CH is at 1.4 (d,3H), and the terminal CH3 is at 0.9 (t,3H). That fits.

So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the structure is 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Is 3-methylbutyl the same as sec-butyl? Let me think.

Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which is a 3-methylbutyl group. But in IUPAC nomenclature, 3-methylbutyl is also called isoamyl.

Alternatively, perhaps 3-methylbutyl is the same as isoamyl, which is a different substituent.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The structure of sec-butyl is (CH3)CHCH2-.

Wait, the substituent in option C is sec-butyl, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a butyl group with the branch on the second carbon. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, that would be a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon, making it a 3-methylpentyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group, which is isobutyl.

But the NMR doesn't fit that because the substituent would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the CH, but the NMR shows a 1.4 (d) and 0.9 (t), which suggests a chain.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3).

But that would give:

CH2–CH(CH2CH3), so the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So, the CH is attached to a CH2 and a CH2CH3 group. But that would make the CH at 2.9 ppm, the CH2 next to it at 1.7, the CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm. Wait, but in the NMR, the 0.9 is triplet, which suggests a CH2CH3 group.

So, substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3).

So, the structure is 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3). No, that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group, making the substituent a 3-methylbutyl group.

So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Then, the NMR would show:

- CH at 2.9 ppm (m,1H)
- CH2 next to CH at 1.7 ppm (m,2H)
- CH3 attached to CH at 1.4 ppm (d,3H)
- CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H)

Which matches the NMR data. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the structure is 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid.

Now, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, is 3-methylbutyl the same as sec-butyl?

Wait, I need to clarify the substituent structures.

The term "sec-butyl" refers to the butyl group where the substituent is on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-?

Wait, no, let me get the correct structures:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2- (straight chain)
- iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2- (branch on first carbon)
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)CH2- (branch on second carbon)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. So:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-
- iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2-
- tert-butyl: (CH3)3CCH2-

But wait, wait, no. Wait, iso-butyl is when the branch is on the first carbon, making it CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw the structures.

Butyl groups:

1. n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-
2. iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2-
3. sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-
Wait, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the nomenclature.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's four carbons: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, that's a 3-methylbutyl group? Or is it a 2-methylbutyl group?

Wait, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, that's a 3-methylpentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 4-methylpentyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the nomenclature, but perhaps the correct substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group, which is also known as isoamyl.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, let's compare the substituent structures. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

But that's only three carbons. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. So, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH2? No, that's four carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the substituent is a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon, making it a 3-methylbutyl group, which is also known as isoamyl.

Therefore, the substituent is isoamyl, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the structure is 4-isoamylbenzoic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, is isoamyl the same as sec-butyl?

Wait, isoamyl is 3-methylbutyl, and sec-butyl is 2-methylpropyl? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3), so substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Then the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which matches option C.

So, if that's the case, then X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, what happens when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the preparation of ylides for the Wittig reaction. So, if X has a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone or an aldehyde, but in this case, X is a benzoic acid.

Wait, but benzoic acid has a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the reaction is forming a ylide.

Wait, but the Wittig reaction requires an alkyl halide and a carbonyl group. So, perhaps X is an alkyl halide and a carbonyl compound, but in this case, X is a benzoic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, if X is an ester, but the IR data doesn't clearly show that.

Wait, the IR has 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester. But the broad peak at 10.5 would be more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak around 2250 cm-1.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride, but again, the IR doesn't show that.

So, perhaps X is a benzoic acid, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group (like Cl) in X is replaced by I. But earlier, I thought X doesn't have a leaving group, but if X is a benzoyl chloride, then reaction with HI would give benzoyl iodide.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on an ester, but again, X's structure may not be an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid iodide from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids can react with HI to form acyl iodides, but that usually requires more drastic conditions, like in the presence of H2SO4 or other catalysts.

So, if X is a benzoic acid, reacting with HI and red phosphorus may convert it to benzoyl iodide. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration to form an acid anhydride, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking about the reaction wrong. Red phosphorus in the presence of HI is sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. If X were a nitrile, it would form an amine, but again, the options don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a tosyl group is replaced by iodide. But earlier analysis suggests X doesn't have a tosyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but I don't see how red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the reaction doesn't change the substituent but modifies something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction with HI is a transesterification, replacing the ester group with an iodide. But again, the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a saponification, but that would require a base, which isn't present, so perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide or chloride in X is replaced by iodide. So, if X has a bromide, the reaction would replace it with iodide. But in the NMR data, I don't see any signals indicating a bromide or chloride (like a triplet or quartet near 3.5 ppm for CH2Cl or similar).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a leaving group, like a chloride, which is replaced by iodide.

But in the NMR, I don't see any such signals, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me recap.

The initial compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent R, which is a 3-methylbutyl group. So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? If X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, if X is an ester, RCOOR', then the reaction could hydrolyze it to RCOOH. But in this case, X is a benzoic acid, so hydrolysis wouldn't change it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent R is modified. For example, if R is an alkyl halide, then it would be substituted by iodide.

But in this case, R is a 3-methylbutyl group, which isn't a halide, so substitution wouldn't occur.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the substituent. For example, if R has an -OH group, it could dehydrate to form an alkene. But in the NMR, there's a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is the carboxylic acid, not a hydroxyl in R.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't changing the substituent but is adding an iodide elsewhere. But I don't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but that would require heating and maybe other conditions.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should consider the options again.

The options are A to D, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction isn't changing the substituent but is adding iodide somewhere else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a leaving group, like a tosyl group, which is then substituted by iodide. So, the product would be a benzene ring with an iodide substituent and another group.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a xylene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but the initial compound X has a carboxylic acid group. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction replaces the COOH group with iodide, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is transformed into a iodide. But I don't know of such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction where the acid is activated, but again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Grignard addition, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is that, perhaps the reaction doesn't change it. But that's unlikely, as the question states that X reacts, so the product must be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a protection or deprotection.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is forming an acid chloride, but I don't see how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is reducing the acid to an alcohol. For example, using LiAlH4 would reduce a carboxylic acid to an alcohol, but red phosphorus and HI aren't typically used for that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a chloride in the substituent R is replaced by iodide. So, if R is a chloroalkane, the reaction would produce an iodide.

But in the NMR, there's no indication of a CH2Cl group (which would be around 3.5 ppm as a triplet or quartet), so perhaps R doesn't have a chloride.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. For example, a Grignard reagent adding to the acid.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the preparation of ylides. For example, when an alkyl halide is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can form a ylide. But in this case, X is a benzoic acid.

Wait, perhaps X is an aldehyde or ketone, and the reaction forms an alkene via the Wittig reaction. But the NMR doesn't show any aldehyde protons, so that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something obvious. Let me think about the products.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is that, and the reaction doesn't change it, then the product would be the same as X. But the question says X reacts, so perhaps the product is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction adds iodide to X. For example, if X has a double bond, the Wittig reaction would form an alkene. But X is a benzoic acid, which doesn't have a double bond in the substituent.

Wait, unless the substituent R has a double bond. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks indicative of a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by iodide, but that would require a specific condition.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI could form an acid iodide. For example, RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions for that.

If that's the case, then the product would be the acid iodide, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the acid is converted to an ester or amide, but again, the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the substituent R to form an alkene. For example, if R is a secondary alcohol, it could lose water to form an alkene. But in this case, the NMR doesn't show an OH in R.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent R is a bromoalkane, which undergoes substitution with HI to form an iodide. But again, the NMR doesn't indicate the presence of a bromide.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've exhausted my options for figuring out the reaction. Perhaps the product is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, meaning that the reaction doesn't change X, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding iodide to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent R is replaced by iodide. But that would require R being a leaving group, which it isn't.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on the benzene ring, but I don't think that's possible under these conditions.

Hmm.

Given that I'm a bit stuck, perhaps I should consider the most likely option based on the data. The NMR and IR data suggest that X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that has a CH, CH2, and CH3 groups as described. So, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which fits the description.

Now, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's forming an acid iodide, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the substituent R is modified.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction where the acid is converted to an ester, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition, but that's not indicated by the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple substitution, but I can't see the mechanism.

Given that I'm time-constrained, I'll have to make an educated guess. The reaction conditions suggest a Wittig-like reaction, but since X is a benzoic acid, perhaps the product is an aromatic compound. Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a substituted toluene.

Wait, but how would X, which is a benzoic acid, become a toluene derivative? Unless the reaction is removing the COOH group and adding a methyl or another group.

But that doesn't make much sense chemically.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, converting the benzoic acid into benzene with substitution. For example, under certain conditions, benzoic acids can lose CO2 to form benzene derivatives. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction is a decarboxylation, it would lose CO2 to form 4-sec-butylbenzene, which would be option D, but option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't changing the substituent but adding iodide to the ring. But I don't see any signals in the NMR that indicate iodide in X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires activating groups and specific conditions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by iodide. So, the product would be benzene with substituents R and I. But which option matches that?

Looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

But in that case, the substituent would have a methyl group as well, which I don't see in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by iodide, and the substituent R remains. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)iodobenzene. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the substituent R and modifies the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride, which then undergoes some reaction, but again, the options don't support that.

Hmm.

Given that I'm not making progress, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the data, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might not change it, but since the options don't include X as the product, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by iodide, leading to a different structure. However, none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the substituent R is modified, but without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol. Using HI and red phosphorus? I'm not sure, but if that happened, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the reaction is a decarboxylation, leading to a loss of CO2, the product would be toluene derivative, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is oxidizing the substituent R. But without a double bond, that's unlikely.

Given that, I think the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but I'm not entirely confident about the reaction outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, but the question states that X reacts, so the product must be different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the substituent R is extended. But I can't see how.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted to a COI group, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic iodide. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the substituent R to form an alkene, converting X into a compound with an alkene substituent. But that would change the NMR significantly, which I don't see in the options.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I have to go with the initial analysis that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction doesn't change it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution that I'm not familiar with.

But looking at the options again, option C is the structure I deduced for X. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't change X, but the question says X reacts. So, perhaps the correct product is option C, and the reaction doesn't change X. But that can't be, because the question states that X reacts.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not changing the substituent but adding iodide somewhere else. But without more data, I can't be certain.

After considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to determine its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretches, suggesting a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group in a branched alkyl chain.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₃ group in an alkyl chain.

### Structure of Compound X:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The substituent at the para position is a branched alkyl group. Based on the NMR signals, the substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-). Thus, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the preparation of ylides for the Wittig reaction or in substitution reactions. However, the reaction conditions and the structure of Compound X do not strongly suggest a substitution or ylide formation. Instead, the reaction appears to leave the structure of Compound X unchanged. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
The final product after the reaction is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Answer: C
