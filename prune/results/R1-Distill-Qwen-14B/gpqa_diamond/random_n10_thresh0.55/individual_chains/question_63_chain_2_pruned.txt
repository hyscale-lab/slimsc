Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So I remember that this model considers both the rotation and vibration of the molecule as quantized states.

First, I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it moves to the next lowest energy state. But I'm a bit confused about whether that's a rotational state or a vibrational state change.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is probably a combination of both rotation and vibration. Oh wait, maybe this model treats the molecule as a rotating and vibrating system, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about rotation with some consideration of bond vibrations. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the molecule can change either its vibrational state or its rotational state. The photon's energy would correspond to a transition between these states.

Wait, the question is about the lowest possible energy switch. So perhaps the next state is the lowest energy state higher than the fundamental. So the molecule transitions from its ground state to the first excited state.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are quantized in both
