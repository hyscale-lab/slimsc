Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the inverse of distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, wait, no, actually, parallax is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is reciprocal. So, distance d (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1 / plx.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, substituting d into this, we can express N in terms of d. Let me write that out. N = k * (1/(plx))^5. Since plx = 1/d, that means plx = d^{-1}. So replacing that, N = k * (d)^5. So that makes N proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, right, so it's the change in N with respect to r. So maybe they're asking about the differential relationship, like dN/dr.

Wait, let's think. N is proportional to d
