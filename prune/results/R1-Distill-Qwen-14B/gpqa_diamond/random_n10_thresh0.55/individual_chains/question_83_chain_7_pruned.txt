Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, what's the question again? Oh right, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point after diluting the acetic acid with water. Let's break this down step by step.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

First, I think I should figure out the diluted concentration of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated. Moles = Molarity × Volume. The volume is in liters, so 0.02 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles to 40 cm³, so the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Okay, so the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ions (CH3COO^-), which will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

But the question has two parts: pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with the 25% titration point. 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. That means we've added 0.00025 mol of NaOH.

Wait, but wait. The volume of NaOH solution used will be important too. Because the NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume of NaOH used is moles / concentration. Moles is 0.00025 mol. So volume = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. But during the titration, the total solution volume will be the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but at 25% titration, the solution's volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³? Hmm, but for dilute solutions, sometimes they approximate, but maybe we should consider it accurately.
