Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. But if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So the mass of the nucleus would be the mass of Li-6.

Wait, actually, wait a second. The mass number A is the sum of protons and neutrons. So for Li, which is element 3, if it has 3 neutrons, then A=3+3=6. So yes, Li-6. So the mass I need is for a Li-6 nucleus.

So, the mass of Li-6 is important here. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons. But wait, perhaps I should use the atomic mass, considering electrons as well. Or maybe the question is referring to the nucleus as a whole, so perhaps I should use the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass? Wait, but for heavy ions, the electrons' mass is negligible compared to the nucleus. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass is that of a single nucleon? No, that can't be. The nucleus is made of multiple nucleons.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass of the ion. So the ion is a Li nucleus with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. The mass would be approximately the atomic mass of Li-6, but excluding the electrons. Or wait, the atomic mass includes electrons, but when we talk about the nucleus, perhaps we're considering the rest mass of the entire nucleus, which includes protons and neutrons. Alternatively, maybe I should use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons.

Wait, but protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. So maybe a better approach is to use the average mass of a nucleon. Or perhaps I need to look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I don't have exact values memorized, but
