Alright, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, okay, let me think. I remember that the interplanar distance formula for crystals usually involves the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices of the plane. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula for a rhombohedral system.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal, right? So the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, and all angles α, β, γ are equal too. In this case, each angle is 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Oh wait, wait. Wait, interatomic distance is usually the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors, so that's 'a' in a cubic system, but in rhombohedral, a, b, c are all the same. So a = 10 Angstrom here.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is d = (a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... ))), but wait, that's for a cubic system. Oh right, for a general crystal system, you have to consider the angles as well.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2/lattice_factor_a)^2 + ... )) ), no, that's not quite right. Wait, I think the formula is:

d = [ (a² (h² + k²
