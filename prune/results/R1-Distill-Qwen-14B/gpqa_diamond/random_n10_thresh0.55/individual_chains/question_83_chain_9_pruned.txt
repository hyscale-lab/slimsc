Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should form acetate ions and water.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid that's diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, initially, the volume is 40 cm³ because 20 + 20 = 40. Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, what happens at 25% titration and at equivalence?

Wait, so the first step is to find the diluted concentration of acetic acid. Initially, the moles of acetic acid are volume (L) times molarity. So, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. Moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then, when diluted with 20 cm³ of water (0.02 L), the new concentration would be moles/(total volume). So, 0.001 moles / (0.04 L) = 0.025 M. Oh right, that's 25 mM. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Wait, no, wait—maybe I should clarify. Titration percentage usually refers to the fraction of the acid that's been neutralized. So 25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate.

But wait, how much NaOH is added at 25%? I think I need to calculate the volume of NaOH required for 25% titration. Let me see.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles (from before). 25% of that is 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH reacting. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, the moles of NaOH needed are 0.00025. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the total solution volume at this point would be the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³. Hmm, but maybe it's better to set up the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
