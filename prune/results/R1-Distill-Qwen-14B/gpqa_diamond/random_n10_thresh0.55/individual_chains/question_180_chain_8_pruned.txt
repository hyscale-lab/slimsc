Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of a system involving charges. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of the system. Minimum energy... that makes me think about the potential energy arrangement. Since we're dealing with charges, I should consider electrostatic potential energy.

Wait, but what's the setup here. So the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. But wait, since each of them is at 2 m from P, what about their arrangement relative to each other? Are they arranged in a way that they're all equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 m? Or are they all at the same point? No, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each is at 2 m, but their positions relative to each other could vary. But since we're looking for minimum energy, I think the charges should be arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy, which typically means arranging them as far
