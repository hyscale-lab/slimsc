Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that both observatories use spectrographs that have different brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than magnitude 17 V. Wait, no, actually, wait—brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. Because lower numbers mean brighter. So ESPRESSO can handle stars with V mag up to 17, but anything brighter than that (like V=16) is fine too.

Wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh wait, no—wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read that again. It says, "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, brighter than 17 in apparent magnitude. So the apparent V magnitude is less than 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, the stars must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17, because anything brighter (lower m) is okay. Wait, no—if it's "brighter than 17", that would mean m < 17. Because 17 is fainter than
