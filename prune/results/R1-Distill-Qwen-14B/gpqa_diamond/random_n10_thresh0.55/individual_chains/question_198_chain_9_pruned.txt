Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, dithiocyanato... that must be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Or wait, no, wait. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. But what's the formula for each complex?

Cobalt typically has a +2 charge, so the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), [Co(SCN)_3]^? Let me think. The charge on each SCN- is -1. So for each complex:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ would have Co^2+ and one SCN^-: 2+ + (-1) = +1. So that's [Co(SCN)]^+.
- [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So neutral.
- [Co(SCN)_3]^- would be 2+ + 3*(-1) = -1.
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2- would be 2+ +4*(-1) = -2.

But wait, in the stability constants, β1 is 9, which is for the first complex. So β1 is [CoSCN^+]/[Co^2+][SCN^-]. Similarly, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2), and so on.

So the complexes are:

1. [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1 = 9
2. [Co(SCN)_2] → β2 =40
3. [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63
4. [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4=16

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3
