Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that at such speeds, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas, so I need to think carefully.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics because of the speed limit c. So, I can't just subtract 0.6c minus 0.5c, that's 0.1c, but that's not how relativity works. The formula for relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is different.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, wait. If the first astronaut is moving at u=0.6c relative to the second, which is moving at v=0.5c in the same direction. So from the frame of the second astronaut, the first is approaching at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the denominator first. 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, so 0.3c² divided by c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.
