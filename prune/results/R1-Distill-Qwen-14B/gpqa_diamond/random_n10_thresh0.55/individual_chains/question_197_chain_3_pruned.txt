Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The compound has specific IR and NMR data, so I'll need to analyze those first to figure out what X is.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are in the regions 3400–2500 cm-1, which I think is the O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid, maybe. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is around where a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester) would show up. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be indicative of aromatic rings, possibly C=C stretching. So maybe X has a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, no, that's around where an aldehyde is, but wait, wait. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have an O-H proton, which is broad and around 10-12 ppm, but that's a very broad peak. Wait, but the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde? Or maybe it's a phenolic OH? But then, the IR would show a broad O-H around 3000, but the IR shows 3400–2500, which is a broad region, maybe for an aldehyde or an alcohol or possibly a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong carbonyl. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So that 10.5 ppm would be the O-H of a carboxylic acid. But wait, the initial thought is that the O-H in a carboxylic acid is broad and between 10-12 ppm, which fits. So that might be that.

Next, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and
