Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits. Let me think.

ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter means lower magnitude numbers. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So HIRES can see down to 16 mag, which is brighter than ESPRESSO's limit. So a star must be bright enough for both. That means the star's apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 mag, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17. Wait, no: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17â€”so anything below (brighter than) 17. HIRES can observe brighter than 16. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 17 (because ESPRESSO can't see beyond 17) and also brighter than 16 (since HIRES can't see beyond 16). Wait, that's confusing. No, wait, the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17, which is dimmer. So for both instruments to see it, the apparent V magnitude must be less than
