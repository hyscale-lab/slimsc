Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula is something like L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and β is the velocity divided by the speed of light (v/c).

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, for unstable particles, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check that. Oh, right, Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, does Γ have to be converted into the same units? I think so.

So first, I need to compute τ. Let's get the constants straight. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because when working with GeV units, it's easier to use this value.

Wait,
