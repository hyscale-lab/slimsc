Okay, so I've been given this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators in the SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let's break this down.

First, what do I remember about symmetries in physics, especially in the SMEFT framework? SMEFT is an effective theory that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed with the Standard Model fields and are classified by their dimension.

So, the question is about which of these symmetries are enforced on all the operators. Let me recall what each of these symmetries entails.

Lorentz symmetry: This is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT being a higher-dimensional extension, I think it must preserve Lorentz symmetry because otherwise, the theory would not make sense as a low-energy effective theory. So all operators should transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations.

Poincare symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a broader symmetry that includes both? Because Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. So if the theory respects Poincare symmetry, it would automatically respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require Poincare?

Wait, the SMEFT is typically considered as a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because it's a low-energy effective theory, it's formulated in a Lorentz-covariant way. But does it have to respect Poincare? Well, Poincare includes momentum translations, which are related to energy-momentum conservation. But in effective field theories, we usually don't require strict Poincare symmetry because they are formulated in a way that's local and Lorentz-invariant, but maybe the full Poincare isn't a requirement? Or does it come into play?

Hmm. Alternatively, I think that in SMEFT, all operators are required to be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. But what about Poincare? Well, the Poincare algebra includes both Lorentz and translation generators. In the SMEFT, the operators are part of the Lagrangian. So for the Lagrangian to be Poincare invariant, it must be a scalar
