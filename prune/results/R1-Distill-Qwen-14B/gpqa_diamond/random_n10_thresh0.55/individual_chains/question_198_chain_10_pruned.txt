Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that there's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. They also provided the stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to find out the fraction of the cobalt that's in the form of the dithiocyanato complex, which I assume is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Because the question mentions dithiocyanato, which means two SCN- ligands.

Wait, but wait. The stability constants are given for β1 to β4. I remember that the stability constant (formation constant) βn is for the complex with n ligands. So β1 would be for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4.

The blue color is usually associated with the [Co(SCN)_6]^3- complex, but wait, that's the hexathiocyanato. Oh wait, maybe in this case, the dithiocyanato is a different complex. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up. Wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato", so it's a different complex than the usual. Or maybe it's a typo, but no, I'll go with what the question says.

So the complexes are Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4. The stability constants are given for each step. So for each n, the βn is the formation constant for adding the nth SCN-.

Wait, no. Wait, the formation constant for the overall complex [Co(SCN)_n]^k+ is given as βn. So for example, the overall β for Co(SCN) would be β1=9. For Co(SCN)_2, it's β2=40, but wait, is β
