Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Right, because at high speeds, you can't just add or subtract velocities like you normally would. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different.

So for the relative speed, I remember that the formula is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait a second. Because both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed is the difference between their speeds, but corrected for relativity. So, since astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. That's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's calculate each astronaut's energy separately.

First astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma for 0.6c is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):
Gamma for 0.5c is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Wait, but let me double-check the gamma calculations.

For the first astronaut, v=0.6c:
v²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. Yep, that's correct.

For the second, v=0.5c:
v²/c² =0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈1.1547. Correct.

So E1=2.5 mc², E2=3.464 mc², sum is 5.964 mc². That rounds to about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says relative speed 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc². Option D says 0.14c and 5 mc². So the correct energy is about 5.96, which is option C or B. Wait, what are the options again?

Options:

A) v_rel =1.1c, E=mc² -> No, that's way off.

B) v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96 -> No, because our relative speed is higher than that.

C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc² -> That matches our calculations.

D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc² -> E is lower.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]
