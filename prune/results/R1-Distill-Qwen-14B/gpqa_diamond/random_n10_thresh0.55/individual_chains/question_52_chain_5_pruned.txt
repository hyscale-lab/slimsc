Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii with a mass of 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

So, the main point here is that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”without spots compared to with spots. The options are A to D, with the answers ranging from about 1.1 to 7.8.

Hmm. I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels can be determined using the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. The formula is something like n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So, in the spots, the temperature is lower. But how does that affect the photosphere? Oh, the question says that the photosphere's temperature is what's relevant here because that's where the Ti atoms are. So, when the star has spots, is the photospheric temperature changing? Or are the spots affecting the overall observed temperature?

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the Teff is lower when there are spots. So in the photosphere, the temperature is 5500 K when there are spots, and 6000 K when there aren't.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. The effective temperature is the overall temperature we observe. But the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So, when spots cover 40% of the surface
