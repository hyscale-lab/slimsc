Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, let's see what I remember. Parallax is related to distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance (in some units, maybe parsecs). 

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So if I consider a range of plx values, like from plx to plx + dplx, how does the number of stars in that range vary as plx changes.

I think I need to model this with some sort of distribution. Stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number density is constant. Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. If they're uniformly distributed in the sky, does that mean their density in space is uniform, or just their angular distribution on the celestial sphere?

Wait, the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." I think that implies uniform in the sense that their positions on the celestial sphere are uniform. But when considering distance, which affects parallax, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. Oh right, because even if they're uniformly spread on the sky, the number you can see depends on how far away they are.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So, in a uniform distribution of stars, the number density n is constant. So for a given distance range, the number of stars increases with the volume
