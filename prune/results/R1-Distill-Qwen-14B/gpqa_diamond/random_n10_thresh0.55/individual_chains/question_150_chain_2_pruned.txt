Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. So, the formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, X is 0 (no halogens), and N is 1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=(10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde group (another 1), or something else. But wait, maybe a ring plus other structures.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That seems like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a triplet if adjacent to something like a CH2 group, which might be the case here. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): This could be a pair of aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Wait, but in para-substituted, each H would have two adjacent Hs if it's a meta situation, but for a para substituent, each H is adjacent to two others? Wait no, in a para-substituted aromatic ring with groups in the para positions, each H would only have two adjacent Hs, but if the substituent is strong, maybe they split into a doublet. Or perhaps it's part of a coupling with another group, like an adjacent coupling.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, perhaps another pair of protons. Maybe another benzene ring or a substituent with Hs. The doublet suggests coupling with another set of Hs.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be a pair of protons that's not very deshielded, maybe an enol group or something adjacent to an
