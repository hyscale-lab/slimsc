Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. So in the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Oh wait, that's option C, but I think this is the non-relativistic case. So the problem here is relativistic, so option C can't be the correct answer because we can't go beyond the speed of light.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So in that case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. I remember the relativistic kinetic energy formula: KE = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So at maximum speed, all potential energy must be converted into relativistic kinetic energy. Let me write that down. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA². So,

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

Let me solve for γ. Rearranging,

γ = 1 + (kA²
