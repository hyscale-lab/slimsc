Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both.

Let me start by understanding the question. The key here is that each spectrograph has a brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, meaning V mag less than or equal to 17. HIRES can go down to 16 mag. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag in V (apparent magnitude) can be seen by both, I think. Wait, no, because ESPRESSO's limit is 17, so any star that's brighter than 17 would be observable by ESPRESSO, but HIRES can only go to 16. So the star needs to have an apparent magnitude ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Wait, wait, no. Because the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be observable by both instruments. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 (since HIRES can't see beyond 16), and also must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the stricter condition is apparent V mag ≤16. So any star with apparent V mag ≤16 can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can
