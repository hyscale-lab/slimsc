Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I have to consider how relativity affects things like mass, energy, and speed.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass. In the classical case, I think the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a classical harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal would give v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so I can't use the classical formulas directly.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's total energy. The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does this tie into the potential and kinetic energy in a relativistic oscillator?

Wait, the problem says it's a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy would be similar to the classical case, perhaps U = (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore because of relativistic effects.

So the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of potential and kinetic energies
