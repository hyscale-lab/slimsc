Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonances, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 to 10^-16 meters. Hmm, I remember that the decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity.

First, I need to recall the formula for the mean decay distance. Oh right, the mean decay length L is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame).

Wait, but how do I find tau? Oh, right. The mean lifetime tau is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is tau = hbar / Γ, where hbar is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but wait, I think the actual formula is tau = hbar / (Γ), but I'm a bit confused. Also, sometimes the total decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. I think that's correct.

But wait, the width is given in MeV. I need to make sure all units are consistent. Let me note down the values:

E_X = 8 GeV,
m_X = 1.2 GeV,
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, first, I need to calculate gamma (gamma factor) and beta. Also, the decay width is in GeV, so I'll have to convert it into appropriate units when calculating tau.

Let's start with the gamma factor. Gamma is E divided by the rest mass energy, because E = gamma * m c². Since E_X is the total energy, gamma is E_X / (m_X c²). But since m_X is given in GeV/c², and E_X is GeV, the c² units might cancel out. Let me think about the units. Because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²), but if m is in GeV/c², then m c² is GeV. So E is GeV, m c² is Ge
