Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Hmm, let me think through each step carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide, I think that's a nucleophilic addition. Oh, right! The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile. 

In the product, I see a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So, the initial product would be the cyanohydrin. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl, forming a new carbon-cyanide bond and a hydroxyl group. So the first step is the formation of a cyanohydrin. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me count the carbons. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is four carbons. The product has four carbons as well? Let me see: 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN (which NaCN would provide) would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but where is the nitrile group attached? Oh, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, wait. Butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions.

So, when a ketone reacts with HCN (which NaCN would acidify to provide), the product is a cyanohydrin. The reaction typically uses an acid catalyst, like H+ (from H3O+), because the acid helps protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic. So in this case, reagent A is likely H3O+ because that's a common acid catalyst for such additions. So looking at the options, A is in options A and B, and D uses NaHSO3 as A.

Wait, but what's the role of A here? Oh, right, A is the reagent added along with NaCN. So in the first reaction, the reagents are NaCN and A. If A is H3O+, that would protonate the carbonyl.

So for the first part, the correct reagent A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: the product from the first reaction, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, is reacting with reagent B and water to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, but the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. The product is a carboxylic acid. So I'm thinking of a reaction where a nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the starting material here is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? One common way is hydrolysis, typically under acidic or basic conditions. For nitriles to carboxylic acids, you usually have two steps: first to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under strong acidic conditions, perhaps it can be done in one step.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, but in the second case, it's a more complex structure, but regardless, the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material in the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is something like (PhCH2Ph)C(OH)CH2CN, but I'm not sure about the exact structure. Anyway, the nitrile group is present, and the product is a carboxylic acid.

So how to get from nitrile to carboxylic acid? One way is hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under strong acidic or basic conditions. The typical reagents are H2O with HCl (H2SO4 and H2O?), or in some cases, using a strong acid.

Wait, but in the options, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH or something else. Let me think about the conditions. The reaction is in the presence of H2O as a reagent, as indicated in the reaction arrow.

So, the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid. Let me recall: nitrile to acid can be achieved via hydrolysis. For that, strong acid conditions are used. Alternatively, under strong base, but that usually gives a different product, like a carboxylate. But since the product is a carboxylic acid, not a salt, the hydrolysis should be under acidic conditions.

Wait, but wait, looking at the reaction: the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (-CN) is converted to -COOH.

So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

This typically involves two steps: first, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to an amide (with H2O under acidic or basic conditions), then the amide is further hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but for primary nitriles, hydrolysis under acidic conditions (like H2SO4, H2O, heat) gives the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, in basic conditions, you get the carboxylate, which can be acidified to the acid.

But in this case, what is reagent B? It's either HCl or CH3COOH, from the options. Let's look at the options again.

In the second reaction, the reagents are B and H2O. So B is either HCl or acetic acid, maybe another acid.

So for the nitrile to carboxylic acid, using H2O and an acid catalyst. So if B is HCl, that would be a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's using H2O and HCl as the acid. Alternatively, maybe B is HCl as a catalyst.

Wait, but another possibility: sometimes, the presence of H2O is a reactant. So the reagent B might be a strong acid like HCl. So in the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid via hydrolysis. So the conditions are H2O and acid (like HCl). So B would be HCl.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. So first reaction uses H3O+ and NaCN, which makes sense. Second reaction uses HCl as B, which would help in the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the reaction steps again. The first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to a ketone, which is done in acidic conditions (H3O+). So that's correct.

The second reaction is the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid. So in the second reaction, the nitrile is in a molecule that also has a hydroxyl group. Would that affect the reaction conditions? Hmm, perhaps. Wait, the molecule is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. Now, when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you'd need to make sure that the OH group doesn't interfere. But perhaps it's not an issue here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when a molecule has both an alcohol and a nitrile, the nitrile can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions without affecting the alcohol. So the nitrile group is being converted to a carboxylic acid.

So, in the second reaction, the reagents are B (H2O) and reagent B is either HCl or something else. So if B is HCl, then the reaction is H2O and HCl. So the nitrile would be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. Alternatively, if B is CH3COOH, that's a weak acid. Would that work for hydrolyzing a nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

Wait, I'm trying to remember: nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, using H2SO4 as the acid catalyst, along with water and heat. So if the reagent B is HCl, that would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis.

So looking at the options, which option has A=H3O+ and B=HCl? That's option A.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option D has A=NaHSO3 and B=CH3COOH. Not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The second reaction is nitrile hydrolysis. So for the second reaction, is there another possibility?

Alternative approach: perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a ketone. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the product is a carboxylic acid, not a ketone.

Wait, no. The product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must become a COOH group.

So the conditions for that would be acidic hydrolysis.

In the second reaction, the reagents are B and H2O. So B is the acid, likely HCl.

So the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A. A=H3O+, B=HCl → correct for both reactions.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → I'm not sure about that. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since HSO3- is a weak acid), but perhaps H3O+ is stronger for the first reaction.

Wait, the first reaction requires acid catalysis. So H3O+ (option A) is correct.

So the correct answer would be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic addition by the cyanide ion. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable acid catalyst for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This typically requires hydrolysis under acidic conditions. The product indicates that the nitrile group is converted directly to a carboxylic acid, which suggests the use of a strong acid like HCl as the catalyst. HCl provides the necessary acidic environment for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to the carboxylic acid.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This is consistent with the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, and HCl is suitable for the second reaction.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and not strong enough for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not as strong an acid as H₃O⁺ for the first reaction, making it less suitable.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither NaHSO₃ nor CH₃COOH provides the necessary acidic conditions for the second reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
