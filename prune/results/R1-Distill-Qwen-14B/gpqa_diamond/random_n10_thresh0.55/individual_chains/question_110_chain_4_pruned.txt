Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer by going through each star's details and applying the given information.

Let me read the question again. It says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning anything with V mag ≤17 is visible. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V mag ≤16 for detection. So a star needs to be observable by both if its V mag is ≤16 because 16 is the brighter limit for HIRES. Wait, wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so any star brighter than 17, meaning V mag less than or equal to 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars with V mag less than or equal to 16 can be observed. So to be visible by both, the star's V mag must be ≤16, since that's the stricter condition.

Wait, no. Wait, the way it's phrased: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter than means lower magnitude. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So if a star has V mag brighter than 17, that means V mag <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V mag <16. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have V mag ≤16, since 16 is the brighter limit for HIRES. Because if it's brighter than 16, it's okay for both. But if it's, say, 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So only stars with V mag ≤16 can be seen by both.

Wait, wait, maybe I got this the other way. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if the apparent V mag is brighter than 17, that means V mag <17. So ESPRESSO can observe anything up to V=17 (but not including 17, I guess, since it's brighter than). So for a star to be visible by both,
