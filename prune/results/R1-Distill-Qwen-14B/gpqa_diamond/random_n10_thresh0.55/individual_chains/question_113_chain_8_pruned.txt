Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying hydrogens and oxygen counts. So I need to figure out which formula fits the spectroscopic data.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate either O-H or N-H stretches. O-H is more common in organic compounds. So maybe this compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually broader and stronger. Hmm, not sure yet.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Let me think about what those could be. The 1700 area is indicative of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 is a bit lower, so maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation? Wait, no, aromatic C=C is around 1600, so 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't see any N in the options. So likely, it's a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone and something else. Or two different carbonyl groups? Or maybe an ester and a carbonyl from another group? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a strong peak, often for esters or ketones. The 1650 could be from conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. Another possibility is that 1650 is due to an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, but that's usually around 1450-1600. Wait, maybe the 1650 is a C=O in a conjugated system, like
