Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about Michael addition reactions, which I remember is a type of 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, because the Michael acceptor has that conjugated system, which makes the beta carbon more electrophilic. So the nucleophile attacks there, leading to a conjugate addition.

Looking at part (A) first: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. Hmm, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. Wait, no, wait. Dimethyl malonate is the enolate itself, right? Because it's a strong base and when treated with something like NaOEt, which is a base, it would deprotonate. So the enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So the Michael acceptor here is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that. The structure is CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to a double bond, but wait, wait—no, the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3? Wait, no, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate group is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but wait, no—acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3. But wait, in the structure, the position is 3-(p-tolyl). So the structure would be CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But the substituent is at the 3-position. So maybe the structure is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3. So like CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps it's the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, and the substituent (p-tolyl) is on the second carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2 (p-tolyl), and the ester is on C3.

Wait, but the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate
