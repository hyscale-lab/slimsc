Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator called Ay. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S. Oh, right, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I should probably write that down.

Let me jot down the S matrix:
S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Then, Ay = c * S, so substituting c, Ay = (h/4π) * S.

So, the matrix Ay would look like this:
Ay = [[0, -(h/4π)i],
      [(h/4π)i, 0]]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that correctly. Multiplying each element by c. So, the top right element is -i * (h/4π), and the bottom left is i * (h/4π). So the matrix is:

[0, (-h i)/(4π)]
[(h i)/(4π), 0 ]

Hmm, okay. Now, the problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. 

Eigenvalues (a) satisfy the equation Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix (Ay - a I):

[ -a, (-h i)/(4π) ]
[ (h i)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is [ (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-h i)/(4π) )*( (h i)/(4π) ) ] = a² - [ (-h i)(h i) ) / (16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that. The product of the off-diagonal elements is [ (-h i)/(4π) ) ] * [ (h i)/(4π) ) ] = [ (-h i)(h i) ] / (16 π²) )

Wait, (-h i)(h i) = (-i^2 h²) = (-(-
