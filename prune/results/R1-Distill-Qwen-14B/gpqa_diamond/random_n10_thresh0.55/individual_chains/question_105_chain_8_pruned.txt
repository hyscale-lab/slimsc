Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is about how the brightness variation caused by these spots compares to the variation caused by an exoplanet. They want to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness change as the spots.

Hmm. Wait, so the star's brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into the line of sight and then go away. This makes the star's brightness dip periodically. Now, the same dip in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) would be caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, blocking some light. They want the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.

Wait, but the problem states that the star has spots, and without the spots, what planet radius would cause the same dip. So, without spots, the dip is due to the planet. So, the dip caused by the spots is equivalent to a planet of what radius?

I think I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots when the star rotates, and set that equal to the fractional change from the planet transit.

First, let's model the star without spots. The brightness variation from a planet transiting would be (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is a circle with radius Rp, and the star's area is (pi Rstar^2). So the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Now, the star with spots: the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us (during rotation), the total brightness decreases. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, each full rotation would show the spots as they come into view and then go out of view, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait, but the problem says the star has a filling factor of 20% for the spots. Filling factor is the area covered by spots in relation to the hemisphere. So each hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So the total area of the spots is 0.
