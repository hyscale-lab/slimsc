Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves spin states and operators, so I remember that I need to think about eigenstates and probabilities.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, but for a state to be normalized, its coefficients must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. So I need to find the normalization factor first. Let's see:

The coefficient for |up> is (1 + i). The magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For |down>, the coefficient is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2^2 + (−1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. So total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Then, the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix elements are given: A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, the operator matrix is a 2x2 matrix since it's dealing with spin-up and spin-down. So let me write that matrix.

A is a 2x2 matrix where diagonal elements are zero (since A_ij is zero when i=j), and off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So A looks like:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Hmm, what kind of operator is this? I think this resembles the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here A seems to be (hbar/2) times sigma_x. Because sigma_x has off-diagonal elements 1, so A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator A are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. Because if sigma_x has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, then A would have the same eigenstates, but scaled by a factor. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, the spin states along the x-axis.

Wait, but the given |alpha> is in the z-basis. So I need to express |alpha
