Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's read it carefully.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, maybe I should normalize this state because probabilities are based on squared magnitudes. I remember that for a state vector, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Wait, the problem says the state is proportional, which means it's not necessarily normalized. So I need to find the normalization factor. Let me compute the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let's compute |1+i|^2 and |2-i|^2.

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1=2.

|2-i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Next, the question is about the operator with matrix elements Aij. The operator's matrix is such that Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, because the states are up and down (two states), the operator matrix looks like this:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because when i ≠ j, it's hbar/2. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. So this is an off-diagonal matrix which I think is the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are usually defined with sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, that's correct. So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the |+x> and |-x> states. The eigenvalues are +1 and -1 multiplied by hbar/2.

Wait, the eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so when multiplied by hbar/2
