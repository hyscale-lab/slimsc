Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions. Let's break down each step.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints given are:

a) When compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is about 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, all cyclic ketones with various substituents.

Hmm. Let's tackle each part.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So A must have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. Since the IR of A is around 1750, that's a strong carbonyl. For ketones, the peak is usually around 1700-1750. So A is probably a cyclic ketone.

Then, when a carbonyl (A) reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with a hydroxyl group and a cyano group attached to the same carbon as the carbonyl was.

So A is a ketone, B is the cyanohydrin.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation catalyst, probably for reducing triple bonds or maybe ketones. Wait, but B is a cyanohydrin. Let me think. The cyanohydrin structure is R2C(OH)CN. So in B, the carbon that was the carbonyl in A now has an OH and CN group.

Hydrogenation of that—Wait, H2 and Pd usually reduce triple bonds to single bonds, but what about in a cyanohydrin? Alternatively, perhaps the Pd is for hydrogenation of the nitrile group. Because in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst like Pd, nitriles (CN) can be reduced to CH2NH2, but wait, actually, under hydrogenation, nitrile usually reduces to an amine (-CH2NH2?), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but in the presence of H2 and Pd, maybe the CN group is reduced. Let's think: Nitrile (R-CN) when hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would become R-CH2-NH2. But then, in our case, the CN is attached to a carbon adjacent to an OH group. So when B is reduced, maybe the CN becomes CH2NH2.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the reduction is not of the CN group. Alternatively, perhaps the Pd is for hydrogenolysis of some other group. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is for the alcohol part. But I don't think so, because alcohols are generally not reduced by H2/Pd unless under specific conditions like high pressure and maybe acidic conditions.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is for another functional group. Wait, but in compound B, the structure is R-C(OH)(CN), which is a secondary alcohol and nitrile. So maybe the reduction is of the nitrile. Let's think:

R-C(OH)(CN) → upon H2/Pd → R-C(OH)(CH2NH2)?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrogenation of the nitrile to an amine. Wait, but then what would compound C be?

Alternatively, perhaps the Pd is causing a different reaction. Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation leads to the elimination of the OH group or something else. Hmm, maybe
