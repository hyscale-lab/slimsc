Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy needed to make a nucleus move at 0.96c. Hmm. Let's see what I know.

First off, the nucleus is described as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So normally, lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which means each nucleus has a mass of about 6 atomic mass units (AMU). But wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact mass, but maybe I can use the formula involving relativistic energy.

The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC. The speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light. So the problem is to find the kinetic energy or the total energy? Wait, usually when they talk about the collider's energy, they mean the kinetic energy, but sometimes I get confused because sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm. I think RHIC's energy is given as the kinetic energy, but I'll have to be careful.

Wait, no, actually, when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy is usually the total energy, which includes both rest mass and kinetic energy. But I'm not sure. Let me think. The formula for total energy is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. So gamma is 1 over square root of
