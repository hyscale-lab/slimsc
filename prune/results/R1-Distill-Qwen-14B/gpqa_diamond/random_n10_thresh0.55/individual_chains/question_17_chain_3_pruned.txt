Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, Ca-EDTA is a complex ion, right? EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem gives me that the concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, 'stoichiometric' probably means that the ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA. So Ca-EDTA would be like CaY²-, where Y is EDTA. 

The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe it's not a big deal. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5×10^10. K here is probably the formation constant, Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. 

So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and Kf would be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, when we have such a high Kf, that means the complex is very stable. So the formation of the complex is almost complete. That would imply that most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, so the free Ca²+ concentration is very low. 

But wait, the solution has 0.02
