Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet the researchers should prioritize observing. Hmm, let's think.

I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us.

The question says both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, wait, orbital period relates to the distance from the star. Because shorter period means it's closer in, right? Using Kepler's third law, which says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So if Planet_1's period is three times shorter, its semi-major axis is cube root of ( (3)^-2 ), so cube root(1/9) which is about 1/2.08. So Planet_1 is about 2.08 times closer to its star than Planet_2 is.

Now, the star around Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. That's because the more massive star is slightly evolved but same size. So, R1 = R2. Interesting.

The probability of a transit is given by the formula: P = (R_s / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so the probability simplifies to (R_s / a), where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (distance from star) of the planet.

Wait, no, actually the formula for the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (something else?)). Wait, let me make sure. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital radius, and the alignment. The exact formula is (R*/a) * (1 / (1 - (R*/a)^2)^0.5)) ?? No, wait, another approach: the probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the planet's orbital distance, multiplied by another factor? Or maybe it's (R* / a) * (something with the impact parameter). Hmm, I think the exact formula is a bit more involved.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is approximately (R*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2))) ), but wait, that might not be right. Another thought: the probability is roughly (R*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2))) ), but if R*/a is small, which it usually is for planets, this can be approximated as R*/a multiplied by 1, because the second term is close to 1. So, maybe the transit probability is roughly proportional to R*/a.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability P is given by the formula:

P = (R_*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_*/a)^2))) )

But wait, I'm not sure. Another source says the probability is (R_*/a) multiplied by (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_*/a)^2)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R*/a) * (sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2)^(-1)) ), but perhaps I should just think in terms of the formula.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbital plane. But that's not exactly it. Wait, no, the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The probability is proportional to (R*/a) divided by (something). Wait, perhaps the formula is (R*/a) divided by (the distance from the line of sight), but that's getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is approximately (R*/a) when R*/a is much less than 1, which is usually the case for planets. So P ≈ R*/a. But I think that's an approximation.

Wait, according to some sources, the transit probability is given by P = (R*/a) * [1 / sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2)] ), but since R*/a is small, the second factor is approximately 1, so P ≈ R*/a.

So, the transit probability is proportional to R*/a.

In this problem, R*/a is the same for both planets because, for each planet, R* is the same (both stars have same radius), and a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, each planet has different a. So, for each planet, R*/a is different.

Wait, for Planet_1, a is smaller (since period is shorter, so closer to star). So a1 = ( (P1)^2 )^(1/3) * some constant. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio of a1 and a2.

Wait, Kepler's third law says (a^3)/(P^2) is proportional to the mass of the star. So a^3 is proportional to P^2 * M_star.

But both planets have the same minimal mass, but the question says they have the same mass. Wait, the question says both have the same minimum masses detected via RV. Wait, but the actual masses could be higher, but the RV gives us the minimum mass. So perhaps M_planet_1 = M_planet_2.

Wait, but Kepler's third law in the context of a planet orbiting a star is (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet) ) / (4π²). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as (a^3)/(P^2) = G M_star / (4π²).

So, a^3 is proportional to M_star * P^2.

So, for Planet_1: a1³ ∝ M1 * P1².

For Planet_2: a2³ ∝ M2 * P2².

Given that M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2's host star), and P1 = P2 /3.

So substituting:

a1³ ∝ (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )² = 2 M2 * P2² /9 = (2/9) M2 P2².

a2³ ∝ M2 * P2².

So the ratio a1³ / a2³ = (2/9) M2 P2² / ( M2 P2² ) ) = 2/9.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

What is (2/9)^(1/3)? 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222.

So a1 is about 0.6 * a2.

Wait, no, because a1^3 is (2/9) of a2^3. So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) = a2 * (cube root of 2/9).

Cube root of 2 is ~1.26, cube root of 9 is ~2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.607. So a1 is about 0.607 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, transit probability is proportional to (R*/a) for each planet.

For each planet:

P1 = (R*/a1) = R/(0.607 a2).

P2 = R/(a2).

So P1 = (R/(0.607 a2)) = (1/0.607) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.646 * (R/a2).

Wait, but P2 is (R/a2). So P1 is approximately 1.646 times P2.

Wait, because a1 is smaller, R*/a1 is larger, meaning higher probability. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but my calculation can't be right because the options don't all have such a high ratio. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Given that a1³ = (2/9) * a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 = 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, 0.61^3 is 0.61*0.61=0.3721, *0.61≈ 0.227. So 0.606^3 ≈ 0.222.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Therefore, R*/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2).

Since P1 = transit prob for planet 1 is proportional to (R*/a1) = 1.65 * (R/a2), which is 1.65 times the transit probability of planet 2.

Wait, but wait, because transit probability is (R*/a) * (1/sqrt(1 - (R*/a)^2 )). But if R*/a is small, as it is for planets, the second term is approximately 1. So P ≈ R*/a.

So for Planet_1: R*/a1 = R/(0.606 a2) = approximately 1.65 times (R/a2) → which is 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

So Planet_1 has a transit probability about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers should choose Planet_1 as it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is way higher, so probably not.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet researchers should prioritize observing, we analyze the transit probability for each planet. The transit probability is proportional to the ratio \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends on the relative semi-major axes of the planets.

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} M_*^{1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter than Planet_2).
- The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \)).

Substituting into the formula for \( a \), the ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_{*,1}}{M_{*,2}} \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{P_1}{P_2} \right)^{2/3} = \left( \frac{2}{1} \right)^{1/3} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{2/3}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = 2^{1/3} \cdot 3^{-2/3} \approx 0.607.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.607 a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). For each planet:
\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R_*}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{R_*}{a_2}.
\]
Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.607 a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.607} \approx 1.65.
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
