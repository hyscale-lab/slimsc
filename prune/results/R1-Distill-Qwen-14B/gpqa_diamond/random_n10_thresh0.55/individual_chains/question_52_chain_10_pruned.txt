Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on. Hmm. So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—do dark spots mean they're cooler regions? So when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature would decrease. That makes sense.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. They observe that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. 

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the populations of different energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait—the ratio given is n1/n2. So when the temperature changes, this ratio would change. The problem states that when there are spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio goes down. That means when the star doesn't have spots (higher Teff), the ratio is higher. So the ratio when no spots (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by the ratio when spots are present (n1/n2)_spots equals the factor by which it changes.

But wait, the transition wavelength is given as 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet. So this transition corresponds to a certain energy difference. Let me think about that.

The energy difference between the two levels can be found using the photon's energy: E = hc/λ. So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m). Let me calculate that quickly. Oh, but maybe I don't need the exact value because it might cancel out.

Wait, but the ratio of the populations depends on the exponential term. So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). But E2-E1 is equal to hc/λ, right? Because the transition emits a photon of that wavelength, so E = hc/λ. 

So, let me denote ΔE = hc/λ. Then the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential smaller. So (n1/n2) decreases when T decreases. Oh wait, but wait, because it's exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so for higher T, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio is larger. That aligns with the observation that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is lower.

So when the star has no spots (T = 6000 K), the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots. 

Let me compute this factor. Using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the factor is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me compute it correctly. Let me think: 

Factor = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T_spot - 1/T_no_spots) )

Wait no, because:

(n1/n2)_no_spots = exp( -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) )

(n1/n2)_spots = exp( -ΔE/(k T_spots) )

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no_spots) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T_spots) ] ) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) ) )

Wait, wait, let's make it more precise. Let me write:

Factor = [exp(-x1)] / [exp(-x2)] = exp( x2 - x1 ), where x1 = ΔE/(k T_no_spots), x2=ΔE/(k T_spots).

So Factor = exp( (ΔE/k) (1
