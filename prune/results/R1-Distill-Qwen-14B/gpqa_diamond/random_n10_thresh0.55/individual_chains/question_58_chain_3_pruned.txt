Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization when energy levels are high. Let me think.

Regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those points where calculations blow up to infinity, which obviously isn't physical. So regularization helps make the math manageable by introducing a temporary "cutoff" or some other method to control these infinities before they're handled by renormalization.

Alright, the options are A to D. Let's go through each one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Wait, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's supposed to be a candidate for a theory of everything. I remember that in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings instead of point particles. Since it incorporates gravity, it's a quantum gravity theory. Now, quantum field theories like QED and QCD have divergences that require regularization. But string theory is different because it's background-dependent and maybe doesn't have the same types of divergences? Or does it? Wait, I'm not so sure. I think in superstring theory, the formalism might still involve some divergent terms, but perhaps the theory itself doesn't require the same kind of regularization as other QFTs because it's formulated differently. Or maybe it's because it's a background-independent theory? Hmm, not sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I remember that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, and it's asymptotically free. But regardless, it's a quantum field theory, so it should have the same kinds of issues as any QFT. So it must require regularization. Like, when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences, so you need to regularize them before renormalization. So B would require regularization, so the answer isn't B.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, electrons and photons. It's the first quantum field theory developed. QED definitely has issues with divergences. For example, the calculation of the electron self-energy leads to infinities. So you need to regularize, maybe using a cutoff or dimensional regularization, and then renormalize. So C requires regularization, so not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, that's the classical theory, not the quantum version. Classical theories don't deal with the same divergences as quantum field theories because they don't have the same mathematical structure. In classical ED, you have Maxwell's equations which are well-behaved. For example, the classical electron doesn't have the same issues with self-energy as the quantum version does. So in the classical theory, you don't need regularization because there are no divergent integrals or infinities in the way you compute things. So D doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So the only theory that's not a quantum field theory here might be D. Because the others (A, B, C) are quantum theories and would have the same kinds of issues. But wait, superstring theory is a quantum theory but perhaps formulated in a way that doesn't require regularization? Or maybe it's that
