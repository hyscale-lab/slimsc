Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the major product is when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is often involved in dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. Oh wait, right, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile.

So the starting material is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me visualize that structure. Cyclopenta-diene would be a five-membered ring with two double bondsâ€”wait, wait, no. 1,3-diene in a five-membered ring. So positions 1 and 3 are double bonds? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene. Oh wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. So the ring has two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. So the structure is like cyclopenta with double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions. And there's a fluorine substituent at position 5. So the fluorine is on carbon number 5 of the cyclopentadiene.

Wait, but maleic anhydride is the dienophile here. So the reaction would be a Diels-Alder between the diene (cyclopentadiene) and
