Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and then break it down.

The question is about a reaction involving substance X and liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's go piece by piece.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with liquid Y. What kind of reactions are violent? Maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid, producing hydrogen gas. For example, metals like sodium or potassium reacting with water. So X could be a metal, Y could be water (H2O). Wait, but Y is a liquid. Water is a liquid, so that fits.

The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. So the gas's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton each, so total 2 protons. Neutrons in H are usually 0 or 1, but wait, for each molecule, the total number of protons and neutrons should be the same. Let me think about each molecule.

Wait, the molecule of gas W: if it's H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So per molecule, 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not equal. If W is something else, like CH4? No, that's a gas but maybe not. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, maybe W is CO2? No, that's a gas but in a reaction with metals maybe not. Alternatively, maybe W is NH3? No, because that's a gas but not sure about the reaction. Let's think again about the reaction.

X reacting with Y (liquid) produces W (gas), precipitate G. Let's assume X is a metal, Y is an acid. Wait, but if Y is water, perhaps the reaction is something like a metal reacting with
