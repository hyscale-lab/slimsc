Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, and it's moving towards the observer? Or is the observer in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them? Oh right, the glass is moving towards the observer in the laboratory. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and the beam is moving towards the observer.

Wait, no, the light beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. Oh, so the light is going through the glass slab that's moving. The question is about the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

I remember that in physics, when you have a medium moving relative to an observer, you might need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because if the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and light is moving through it, then the speed of light in the lab frame isn't just simply the speed in the medium plus v or something like that.

Wait, but wait. The speed of light in a medium is usually given by c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But in this case, the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think that in special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame must still be c. So regardless of the motion of the source or the medium
