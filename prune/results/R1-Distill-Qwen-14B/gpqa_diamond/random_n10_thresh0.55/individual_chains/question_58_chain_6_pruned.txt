Okay, so I have this question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll need to think this through.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics. 

Let me go through each one.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is the theory that deals with electrons and photons. I remember that QED has been very successful, but it does have issues with divergences. These are handled using renormalization. But wait, do they need regularization? I think regularization is a part of the process to make renormalization work. So yes, QED requires regularization. So option C is probably not the answer.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong force. It involves quarks and gluons. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with more complexity. It also has issues with divergences, especially because of things like the Landau pole problem. So regularization is used here as well, probably through methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So B is out.

Classical Electrodynamics (CED) is the non-quantum version. Since it doesn't involve the quantum aspects, it doesn't have the same kinds of divergences that QED does. Wait, but does CED have any divergences? Well, in classical theory, you can have issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge, or the self-energy of a charge. Oh right, but in classical electromagnetism, these infinities are handled differently. For example, the concept of a point charge is a bit problematic because of these issues, but maybe they aren't handled with regularization. Or perhaps they don't require regularization because the theory is not quantized.

Wait, but regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So in classical theories, do you even need regularization? Since regularization is used to make divergent integrals finite so that you can renormalize. So if a theory is classical, it doesn't use these techniques. So classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So D is a possibility.

Then there's Superstring Theory (option A). String theory is a quantum theory, trying to unify quantum mechanics with gravity. I'm not too sure
