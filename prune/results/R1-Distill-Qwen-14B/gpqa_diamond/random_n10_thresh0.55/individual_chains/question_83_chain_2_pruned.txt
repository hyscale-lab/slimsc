Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. Alright, I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So, let's find the new concentration after dilution. Acetic acid is being diluted with water. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. 

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M2 is (M1V1) / V2. 

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = 1/4 = 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base), producing the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially. 

But wait, before that, let's think about the 25% titration point. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, in this case, I'll need to calculate the pH at that point.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the moles of NaOH added at 25% titration.
3. Find the new concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion after reaction.
4. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH at 25%.
5. For the equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate, but since NaOH is strong, the solution will have a high pH. It will form a buffer solution if excess, but at equivalence, it's a salt solution. Wait, actually, at equivalence, the solution will contain the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So, the solution will be basic. We need to calculate that.

Let's start with step 1: Moles of acetic acid after dilution.

Volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. Molarity is 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Wait, 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001? Let me compute that: 0.025 * 0.0
