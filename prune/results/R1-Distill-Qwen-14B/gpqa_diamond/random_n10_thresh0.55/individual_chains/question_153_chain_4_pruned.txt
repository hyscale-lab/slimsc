Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates acting as nucleophiles attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The first part of the question has three different reactions, and I need to determine the major products for each, then match them to the options provided.

Starting with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate, but wait, in the Michael reaction, the enolate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. When the enolate forms, it's at the beta position, right? Because malonate has two carbonyls, so it can form a conjugated base.

The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent in the E configuration. So the enolate from malonate will attack the beta position (the CH2 part) of the acrylate. So the attack would happen on the carbon next to the carbonyl.

After the attack, the product would be a new carbon-carbon bond. The malonate's enolate adds to the acrylate. Let me imagine the structure. The malonate is (CH3CO)2CH-. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. When the enolate attacks, the malonate's carbanion will add to the beta carbon (the CH2 part) of the acrylate.

So the product would have the structure where the malonate is connected to the acrylate. Wait, actually, wait. The acrylate is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Wait, the formula for methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl. Or perhaps it's CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-p-tolyl. No, wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The formula for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be methyl ester of the acrylate, where the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but substituted. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-
