Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

First, let me look at the information given:

1. FTIR Spectrum:
   - A very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be from an -OH group in something like an alcohol or phenol. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not.

   - Two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). A peak at 1650 might correspond to something else, maybe an aromatic ring (C=C) or another carbonyl group? Or perhaps it's an conjugated carbonyl, or an amide? But again, the options don't have amides, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl.

2. 1H NMR Spectrum:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. The presence of vinyl protons in the NMR suggests a double bond somewhere in the structure.

3. Mass Spectrometry:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? I remember common fragments like CH3CO+ (43), but 45 is a bit higher. Maybe it's (CH3)2CO+? Wait, (CH3)2CO has a molecular weight of 58. Alternatively, could it be the fragment C3H7O or something else? Let me think. Another possibility is (CH3)CO, which would be 59? Wait no, perhaps the methyl group and something else. Alternatively, could it be the acylium ion, like CH2=CHCO+? Wait, CH2=CHCO has a molecular weight of 60, but maybe a fragment loses something. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is something like (CH2CH2) with an O attached?

Wait, perhaps the mass at 45 is a cleavage product. Let me think of possible structures. Another thought: The m/z 45 could correspond to a ketene ion (like CH2=C=O), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, it could be something like (CH3)2CO, but that's 58. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)O+ (31) plus something else? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a larger fragment, leaving behind a smaller one. Another approach: calculate the molecular weight of each option and see how 45 could fit.

Wait, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let me compute their molecular weights:

- C6H12O2: (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16
