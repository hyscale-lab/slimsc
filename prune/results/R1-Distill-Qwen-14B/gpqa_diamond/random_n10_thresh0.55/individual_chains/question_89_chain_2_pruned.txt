Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to think through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of a cage-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons, specifically positions 1 and 3.

The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so this likely is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a base, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, in this case, are the bromines on adjacent carbons? Let me visualize the structure. Adamantane's structure is such that 1 and 3 are across the structure, not adjacent. Oh wait, no. Wait, the structure of adamantane: It's a diamond cubic structure, each carbon connected to four others. So 1 and 3 would be on the same face but perhaps not adjacent. Hmm, but in any case, when two bromines are on the same adamantane structure, heating with KOH might lead to elimination. Wait, but since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which has bromines on opposite bridgeheads, elimination might form an alkene bridge.

Wait, maybe it's a
