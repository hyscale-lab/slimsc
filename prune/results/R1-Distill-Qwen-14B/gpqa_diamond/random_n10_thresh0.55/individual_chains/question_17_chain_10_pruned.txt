Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. They’re asking for the concentration of calcium ions. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY^2- or something like that. The formation constant Kf is given, which is a measure of the stability of the complex. A large Kf means the complex is more stable, so the metal is more tightly bound.

But I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. I think I should use the formula for the formation constant. The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA]). Oh wait, but in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

Wait, but EDTA (Y^4-) is present in solution as well, but I'm not sure about the exact stoichiometry here. Let me think. The reaction is Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So the complex has a 1:1 ratio. 

So the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, wait. The problem states that the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M. We're to find [Ca^2+]. 

So rearranging the K expression, [Ca^2+] = [CaEDTA^2−] / (K * [EDTA^4-]).

But hold on, how much EDTA is present? Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and can exist in various protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, which I think implies that EDTA is in its Y^4- form. So [
