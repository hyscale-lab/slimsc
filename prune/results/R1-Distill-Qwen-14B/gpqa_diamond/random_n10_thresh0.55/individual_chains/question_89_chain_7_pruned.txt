Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by breaking down the question step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane probably has bromine atoms on adjacent or specific positions on that adamantane framework.

The first heating step is with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I think this is likely an elimination reaction. When dibromides react with a strong base, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Since we have two bromine atoms on the adamantane, this should form an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, which I think is typical for alkenes because they are usually less polar than the starting dibromide.

Looking at the 1H NMR of product 1: the signals are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, but the product after KOH treatment is an alkene, right? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because the IR for an epoxide's carbonyl isn't at 1720. Wait, 1720 is more like an ester or ketone.

Wait, another thought: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with a strong base, maybe it's a double elimination, but perhaps in this case, it forms a ketone? No, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a pair of equivalent protons. At that shift, maybe an epoxide? Because epoxide protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Or maybe an alcohol, but that would have a broad peak, which isn't indicated here. Alternatively, could it be a carb
