Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is 0 km/s and Star_2 is 700 km/s. The task is to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, so I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, right, because a black body's luminosity is given by that formula.

But wait, the question mentions the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So that means both stars have the same peak wavelength. I also remember Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait—no, because Wien's Law says λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Oh, right because λ1*T1 = λ2*T2. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

So then, for luminosity, since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and if T is the same, then L is proportional to R². Because T⁴ is same for both.

So Star_1 has R = 1.5 R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Hence, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2)² * T² ) / (R2² * T² ) = (
