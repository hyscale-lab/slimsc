Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the question is related to the Boltzmann equation, which deals with the distribution of particles in different energy states. Let me think about what I know.

The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, that means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k_B T) ), right? Here, n_i is the number of particles in state i, and n_j is the number in state j. g_i and g_j are the statistical weights. The energy difference is E_i - E_j, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy levels are the same for both stars, so E_i - E_j is the same value, 1.38e-23 J. I think that for this problem, the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars because we're comparing the same energy levels. So the ratio becomes just the exponential term.

The problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, let's clarify: does this mean the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for the same energy level, n_1 = 2 * n_2. Or is it the ratio of excitation compared to another level? Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait no, the question says that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, n1 (excited) is twice n2 (excited), assuming that the ground state is the same. Or wait, maybe I should model it as the ratio of the excited state to another state, like the lower state.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is saying
