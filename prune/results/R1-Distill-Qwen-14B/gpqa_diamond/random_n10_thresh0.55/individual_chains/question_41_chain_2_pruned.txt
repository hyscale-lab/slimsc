Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer too, but in the same direction as the beam. Wait, no, wait. The question says the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So maybe the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, which would be towards the observer as well. Or wait, perhaps the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam (which is toward the observer).

The question is asking about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. So the glass is moving, and the light is inside the glass. I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab frame is affected by the medium's velocity.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is given by v_light = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But that's in the rest frame of the medium. So if the medium (glass) is moving relative to the lab frame, do we just add the velocities?

Wait, no. Because in relativity
