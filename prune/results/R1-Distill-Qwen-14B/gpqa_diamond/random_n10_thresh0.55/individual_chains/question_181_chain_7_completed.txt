Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are still happening. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux(band1)/flux(band2).

Hmm, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy. The pp-III branch is one part of this chain. I think the pp chain is responsible for producing a lot of high-energy neutrinos, specifically the 700-800 keV range. Oh wait, no, maybe that's another part. Let me get this right.

Wait, the main neutrino producing processes in the Sun are the proton-proton chain (pp) and the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain is the dominant process, especially in the Sun since its metallicity is low. The pp chain has different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch is the one that involves reactions leading to Beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to form Boron-8, which decays into Be-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Those neutrinos are the ones in the ~700-800 keV range.

But wait, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? Well, the pp-III neutrinos are a major source. So if that part stops, the flux from that channel should drop. But what about neutrinos from other sources?

Other reactions in the Sun include the CNO cycle, which produces higher energy neutrinos. The CNO neutrinos are typically higher in energy, maybe around 1-2 MeV or more. Oh wait, but the question is about two bands in lower energy ranges: 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band (which is mainly from pp-III) would be affected.

Wait, so the pp-III neutrinos are around 700-800 keV. So if that branch stops, the flux in band1 (700-800) would drop significantly. But what about band2 (800-900)? Are there other sources contributing to that?

I think the CNO cycle produces neutrinos with higher energies. So if the pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like in band2) might not be affected as much. Because the CNO is still running, right? The question says all other reactions remain as they were. So the CNO is still producing neutrinos.

Wait, so band1 is 700-800, and band2 is 800-900. So band1 is the pp-III range, band2 is perhaps a mix of other sources, like maybe CNO or other parts of the pp chain that are still running.

If the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in band1 would drop to near zero, because pp-III is the main source there. But band2, which is 800-900, might have other sources. For example, maybe some other part of the pp chain (like pp-I or pp-II) or CNO contributes in that range.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are higher, like maybe 1-2 MeV, but perhaps some are lower. Alternatively, maybe the CNO produces a broader spectrum, so some neutrinos fall into the 800-900 keV range. So if the pp-III is stopped, band1 (700-800) would be from pp-III, which is gone, so flux drops. Band2 (800-900) might still have some flux from other sources.

Alternatively, maybe other parts of the pp chain contribute to the lower parts of the band2. For example, perhaps pp-I and pp-II produce some neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range. But I'm not too sure about that. Or maybe the CNO is the main contributor in band2.

Wait, the pp chain is the dominant source, but the CNO contributes as well. Let me think about the typical neutrino energies each process produces.

The main neutrinos from the pp chain are from the pep reaction (which emits around 500 keV) and the Be-7 decay (which emits around 700-800 keV). The CNO cycle produces neutrinos with higher energies, more like 1-2 MeV.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the Be-7 decay neutrinos (700-800 keV) would stop. So band1 flux would drop. But in band2 (800-900 keV), perhaps the CNO still produces some neutrinos, but their energy is higher than 900 keV. Wait, but the CNO neutrinos have a broader spectrum. So maybe some of them are in the 800-900 range? Or maybe the CNO's contribution is at higher energies, so band2 would have less from CNO, but perhaps more from other processes.

Wait, but if the pp-III stops, but other pp branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still active, then perhaps they emit neutrinos. But I think the pp-I and pp-II don't produce as much in the 700-800 range. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the pp chain has several steps. The main one is probably the pp-I branch, where two protons collide, and one emits a positron and a neutrino (pep reaction), producing deuterium. Then, another branch (pp-II) where a proton captures on a deuterium nucleus to form tritium, which then decays beta emission to helium-3. And the pp-III branch is when two helium-3 nuclei fuse into helium-4, but that's not the neutrino part. Wait no, the neutrino emission in the pp chain is from the pep reaction and the Be-7 decay.

Wait, the Be-7 is from the pp-III branch, right. So when a Be-7 nucleus captures a proton to form Boron-8, which then decays into Be-8, a positron, and a neutrino. So that's where the 700-800 keV neutrinos come from.

So if pp-III stops, the Be-7 production stops, so no more Be-7 → B-8 → Be-8, so no more ~700 keV neutrinos. So band1 (700-800) would have very little flux, but band2 (800-900) would still get flux from other sources.

Wait, but what sources contribute to 800-900 keV? The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. Let me think about the typical energy of neutrinos from each process. The pep reaction gives about 500 keV, Be-7 decay gives ~700-800, and CNO gives higher, like 1-2 MeV.

So in the 800-900 keV band, perhaps the CNO isn't the main contributor. Or maybe some lower-energy tail of the CNO neutrinos. Alternatively, maybe there's another process contributing. Wait, perhaps the electron capture in Boron-8? No, Boron-8 emits a neutrino when it decays, but that's the same as the Be-7 decay. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos' energy distribution extends down into the 800-900 keV range, but the majority are higher. So if the pp-III stops, then band1 (700-800) would have no flux, and band2 (800-900) would have some flux from CNO.

But I'm not sure about the exact energy distributions. Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos don't contribute much to band2, so the main source for both bands used to be the same.

Wait, before the pp-III stopped, both band1 and band2 had contributions from the same source, the pp chain. If pp-III stops, the higher energy part (band2) might not get as much? Or maybe the pp-I and pp-II contribute some.

Wait, perhaps the pp-I and pp-II reactions are part of the main pp chain and are still running. The pp-III is a branch that's stopped. The main pp chain's neutrino sources are the pep reaction (which is about 500 keV) and the Be-7 decay (700-800). So if Be-7 is no longer being produced (because pp-III is stopped), then the 700-800 keV neutrinos (band1) would drop.

But the 800-900 keV (band2) might have some contributions from other parts. Wait, but if pp-III is stopped, would the Be-7 production stop, so all the neutrinos in the 700-800 range are gone. But what about the CNO? Do they contribute to 800-900 keV?

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO cycle's neutrinos have a higher energy, so band2 (800-900) would have some contribution from CNO, but perhaps not a lot. Or maybe the CNO's contribution is a significant fraction of the total.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the flux in the two bands. So if band1's flux drops to nearly zero because pp-III stopped, and band2's flux remains mostly the same (assuming CNO is the main source), then the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2) would be near zero.

But wait, the options don't have zero. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the flux. Because if the pp-III stopped, then the neutrinos from that branch are no longer emitted, but the CNO is still going. So how much does pp-III contribute to each band?

Wait, let me think about the distribution. If the pp-III neutrinos are in band1, and CNO neutrinos are in band2, then if pp-III stops, band1's flux drops, and band2's flux is unaffected.

In that case, flux1 would be close to zero, and flux2 would be same as before. So flux1/flux2 would be near zero, but the options don't have that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III is not the only source of neutrinos in band2. Perhaps other processes contribute to band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes to band2 as well. Let me think: the Be-7 decay neutrinos are around 717 keV, right? So in band1 (700-800), that's the main source. So in band2 (800-900), the neutrinos could be from other processes, maybe the CNO, which has higher energies.

Wait, but the CNO neutrinos are higher than 800-900. So perhaps in the 800-900 range, the primary source is the CNO. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 keV band (band1) would have no neutrinos, while the 800-900 (band2) would still have CNO neutrinos.

So the flux in band1 would be much lower than band2. So the ratio flux1/flux2 would be nearly zero. But the options don't have zero. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the CNO neutrinos don't contribute much to band2. Maybe the main source for band2 is also the pp chain. But other branches.

Hmm, perhaps the pp-I and pp-II branches produce some neutrinos. Let me think: the pp-I reaction produces deuterium and a neutrino via the pep reaction (about 500 keV), and the pp-II produces tritium and another neutrino. Wait, no, I think the pp-II doesn't produce neutrinos. The main neutrino sources are the pep reaction and the Be-7 decay.

Wait, so perhaps the only neutrinos from the pp chain are the pep (500 keV) and the Be-7 (700-800). So if pp-III stops, Be-7 production stops, so the 700-800 flux drops. But what about the CNO neutrinos? Are they in the 800-900 range?

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are higher. Let me think about the typical energies. I remember that the CNO neutrinos are higher, so maybe the 800-900 keV is part of their distribution. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 keV flux drops, but the CNO contributes to 800-900.

So in the scenario where pp-III stops, band1's flux is from pp-III (which is gone), and band2's flux is from CNO (which remains). So band1's flux would be nearly zero, band2's is same as before. So flux1/flux2 ≈ 0. But none of the options are zero. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos aren't the main source for band2. What if the pp chain produces some neutrinos in band2? If the pp-III stopped, but the other branches are still running, maybe the pp-I and pp-II contribute to band2.

Wait, but I thought the pp chain's main neutrino sources are in the ~500 keV and ~700 keV regions. So perhaps the 800-900 keV comes from the CNO.

Alternatively, maybe the CNO neutrinos have a significant presence in band2, so that if the pp-III stops, the flux in band1 (700-800) is mainly from the pp-III and drops, while band2 (800-900) is mainly from CNO and doesn't drop. So the ratio would be small, like 0.01.

But wait, the options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So, if the ratio is flux1/flux2 = (something small)/(something large) = 0.01, that's option B.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III contributes more to band2 than I thought. But I'm not certain. Let me think about the relative contributions.

In the Sun, the majority of neutrinos come from the pp chain. The CNO neutrinos are a smaller fraction (maybe about 10-20% of total). So if the pp-III stops, the pp chain's contribution to band1 (700-800) is eliminated, but the pp chain's contribution to band2 (800-900) is only from other reactions (like pp-I?), which I don't think are significant.

Wait, but if only the pp-III stops, then the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) are still producing neutrinos. But I'm not sure if their neutrinos fall into band2. Let me think about the energies.

The pep reaction (pp-I) produces a neutrino of about 500 keV. The Be-7 decay (pp-III) is about 700-800 keV. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band loses its main source, but the 500 keV band (which is band0, perhaps) also loses some? No, the 500 keV is from pp-I, which is still running.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio between the two bands. So, prior to the pp-III stopping, the flux in band1 (700-800) was high because of Be-7 neutrinos, and band2 (800-900) was from CNO and any other pp contributions. So when pp-III stops, band1's flux drops, and band2's flux remains roughly the same.

So the ratio would be flux1/flux2 = (old_flux1 - new_flux1) / (flux2) = (close to zero) / (flux2) ≈ 0. But the options don't have zero. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are the main source for both bands, but that doesn't make sense because their energies are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the average flux in each band. If the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band loses almost all its neutrinos, whereas the 800-900 band only loses a small part. So the ratio would be (flux1)/(flux2) ≈ 0, but again, the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III are not the only source in band1. Perhaps the CNO neutrinos also contribute to band1, but that doesn't make sense because they have higher energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a lower-energy tail that contributes to band1. But I think their main contribution is higher than 800 keV.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that extends down into the 800 keV region. So band2 (800-900) would have a significant portion from CNO.

So, before the pp-III stopped, band1 had a lot from pp-III (700-800), and band2 had some from CNO. After pp-III stops, band1's flux drops, and band2's flux is from CNO, which was a small part.

So the ratio would be (old_flux1 - new_flux1) / (flux2). But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: the pp-III is responsible for a significant fraction of the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band. If it stops, the flux in band1 would drop to nearly zero. The CNO neutrinos, which are higher, would dominate band2. So the flux ratio would be nearly zero, but since the options don't have zero, perhaps the correct choice is B) 0.01, which is 10^-2, meaning flux1 is 1% of flux2.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are a small fraction of the total, but the pp-III is a large fraction. So the ratio could be about 1:10, which would make flux1/flux2=0.1, which is option D.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the absolute numbers. Suppose the total neutrino flux before the pp-III stopped was dominated by the pp chain. The CNO contributes, say, 10% of the total. So if the pp-III is responsible for, say, 50% of the neutrinos in band1, and the CNO contributes 50% of the neutrinos in band2.

Wait, maybe the neutrino energy distribution from the pp-III is a peak around 700 keV, while the CNO has a broader distribution peaking higher. So in the 700-800 band, pp-III is the main source, while in 800-900, CNO is the main source.

So if pp-III stops, band1's flux drops, and band2's remains. So the ratio would be (flux1 after)/ (flux2 after) = (0)/(flux2) ≈ 0, but that's not an option.

Wait, but perhaps the pp chain still has other neutrino sources. For instance, the pep reaction (pp-I) produces neutrinos around 500 keV, but perhaps there's another process in the pp chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp chain's main neutrino sources are the pep (500 keV) and the Be-7 decay (700-800 keV). So if pp-III stops, the 700-800 band would lose the Be-7 neutrinos. The 500 keV band would lose the pep neutrinos if pp-I were stopped, but in this case, only pp-III is stopped.

Wait, no: the question says only the pp-III branch stops, so the pp-I and pp-II are still active.

But the pp-I (pep reaction) produces neutrinos at 500 keV, which is in a band lower than band1. So the 700-800 band is mainly from pp-III, which stops.

So, after the stop, band1 (700-800) would have minimal flux, and band2 (800-900) would have flux from CNO and perhaps negligible from pp.

But wait, if the CNO neutrinos are higher than 900 keV, then the 800-900 band might have less. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a distribution that includes 800-900 keV. So the flux in band2 would remain, but the flux in band1 would drop.

So the ratio would be (flux1 after) / (flux2 after) ≈ (0) / (flux2) = 0. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I should choose the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrino flux in band1 is much higher than band2 under normal circumstances, so when pp-III stops, band1 drops to near zero, and band2's flux is a small fraction of what it was, but this is getting confusing.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the flux between the two bands after the pp-III stops. Before the stop, band1 had a lot of flux from pp-III, and perhaps band2 had less flux. So the ratio was high before. Now, after the stop, band1's flux is almost gone, and band2's is still present. So the ratio becomes very low.

If the original ratio was, say, 10, then after the stop, it would drop to a much lower value.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to the 700-800 keV band. So if that stops, the flux in band1 drops to near zero. The 800-900 band would still get neutrinos from other sources, like the CNO, so its flux remains roughly the same.

So the flux ratio would be approximately (0) / (non-zero) ≈ 0. But since 0 isn't an option, perhaps the closest is B) 0.01, which is 10^-2.

Wait, but if the CNO contributes a significant amount to the 800-900 band, then the ratio would be 0 / (flux2) which is 0, but without that option, maybe it's B.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are a small fraction of the total, so even if pp-III stops, the 800-900 band's flux is much less than the previous 700-800. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the total number of neutrinos from the pp chain is much higher than the CNO. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band's flux (which was mainly from pp-III) drops, while the 800-900 band (which may have some from CNO) remains. So the ratio is (flux1 after)/(flux2 after) = (0)/(CNO flux) ≈ 0. But again, no option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are negligible, so both bands rely on the pp chain. But that doesn't make sense because CNO is a major source, albeit smaller than pp.

Wait, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a higher energy, so in the 800-900 band, they are the main contributors. So if pp-III stops, the 700-800 band's flux is near zero, and the 800-900's is from CNO, which is a smaller fraction of the total.

So the ratio would be (0)/(flux2) = 0, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is B) 0.01.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos are about 10% of the total. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 flux (which was 90% from pp-III) drops to 10% (from CNO?), and the 800-900 is 10% of the total (from CNO). So the ratio would be 0.1 / 0.1 = 1, which is option C.

Wait, that might make sense. Because before the stop, the 700-800 band had, say, 90% from pp-III and 10% from CNO. The 800-900 band had, say, 10% from CNO and maybe 1% from other pp sources. So after the stop, the 700-800 band would have only 10% (from CNO), and the 800-900 would have 10% (from CNO) as well. So the ratio becomes (0.1)/(0.1) = 1, which is option C.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact percentages. If the CNO contributes, say, 10% to the total neutrinos, then their contribution to the specific energy bands would depend on their spectrum.

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO neutrinos have a distribution that peaks higher, so the 800-900 band gets a larger fraction of CNO neutrinos.

Wait, this is getting a bit too speculative. Another approach: the pp chain produces a lot of neutrinos in the 700-800 band, and the CNO produces some in the 800-900 band. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band's flux drops, while the 800-900's remains (from CNO). So the ratio would be much less than one.

If the CNO contributes about 10% of the total, then the ratio might be 10% (flux2) compared to 1% (flux1). So 0.01, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the CNO contributes about the same amount to both bands, the ratio would be 1, but I don't think that's the case.

So perhaps the correct answer is B) 0.01.


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV, band 1, and 800-900 keV, band 2) after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range through the decay of Boron-8, which is a significant source of neutrinos in band 1. The CNO cycle, on the other hand, produces higher-energy neutrinos, typically around 1-2 MeV, but may contribute to the 800-900 keV range as part of its broader energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources**:
   - The pp-III branch is the primary source of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range (band 1). If this branch stops, the flux in band 1 will drop significantly.
   - The CNO cycle is the primary source of higher-energy neutrinos, which may contribute to the 800-900 keV range (band 2). The CNO neutrinos are generally higher in energy, but their spectrum can extend into the 800-900 keV range.

2. **Impact of pp-III Stopping**:
   - After the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) will drop to near zero, as this band is almost entirely dependent on the pp-III neutrinos.
   - The flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) will remain largely unaffected, as it is primarily powered by the CNO cycle, which continues unabated.

3. **Flux Ratio**:
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 1 is dominated by pp-III neutrinos, while the flux in band 2 is a mix of contributions from the CNO cycle and possibly other minor sources.
   - After the pp-III branch stops, band 1's flux drops to near zero, while band 2's flux remains largely unchanged. This results in a very small ratio of flux(band 1) to flux(band 2).

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 10**: This would imply that band 1's flux is significantly higher than band 2's, which is inconsistent with the scenario where band 1's flux drops to near zero.
   - **B) 0.01**: This corresponds to flux(band 1) being approximately 1% of flux(band 2). This is plausible, as band 1's flux drops to near zero, while band 2's flux remains dominated by CNO neutrinos.
   - **C) 1**: This would imply that the flux in both bands is roughly equal, which is inconsistent with the significant drop in band 1's flux.
   - **D) 0.1**: This corresponds to flux(band 1) being 10% of flux(band 2). While this is closer to the expected ratio, it overestimates the remaining flux in band 1.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable ratio, given the significant drop in band 1's flux and the continued contribution of CNO neutrinos to band 2, is **flux(band 1) / flux(band 2) ≈ 0.01**.

ANSWER: B
