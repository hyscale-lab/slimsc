Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's see. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll have to think it through.

Hmm, the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, I'm not sure about how the spots affect the temperature. Do the spots themselves have a lower temperature, making the average Teff go down? That makes sense.

The main point is about the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2. When there are spots, this ratio decreases. The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, so without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So I need to find (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Wait, but wait: in the Boltzmann distribution, it's n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So if level 2 is higher in energy than level 1, then if temperature increases, the ratio n2/n1 increases because the exponential term gets bigger.

But in this problem, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, T_eff is 5500 K, compared to 6000 K when it doesn't.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the star's overall Teff goes from 6000 to 5500 when spots are present. But the question says that when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So the temperature of the photosphere is lower in the spotted case.

So for the ratio, without spots, T is
