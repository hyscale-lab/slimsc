Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, right. So, the first thing I remember is that when a particle decays, the total energy available must be enough to produce the decay products. That is, the mass of the decaying particle must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of each of the produced particles, assuming they're fermions here.

Wait, the boson X here is interacting with fermions. So the interaction term looks like λ f ψ̄ (something) ψ. Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, maybe this is a Yukawa interaction? Because Yukawa interactions couple a scalar (or boson) to fermions, so that makes sense.

So, X is a boson with mass 6 GeV. Since it's a boson, when it decays, it can produce pairs of fermions. For example, X → f f̄.

But wait, fermions come in different types—like electrons, muons, taus, up, down, strange, charm, top, etc. Each has their own mass. So I need to check which fermion pairs can be produced with the given mass of X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, for each fermion f, the sum of the masses (since we produce a pair, so 2m_f) must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So, let's list the masses of the known fermions. 

Electron: negligible, about 0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV. That's way below 6 GeV. So e+ e- decay is allowed.

Same with muons: muon mass is about 0.105 GeV. So 2m_mu ≈ 0.21 GeV. Also allowed.

Tau: tau mass is about 1.777 GeV. 2m_tau ≈ 3.554 GeV. Less than 6, so allowed.

Quarks: Let's see.

Up quark: around 2 MeV (so 0.002 GeV). 2m_u ≈ 0.004 GeV. Allowed.

Down quark: similar, around 4-5 MeV. So 0.008-0.01 GeV. Allowed.

Strange quark: about 95-100 MeV, so 0.095-0.1 GeV. 2m_s ≈ 0.19-0.2 GeV. So allowed.

Charm quark: around 1.27 GeV. 2m_c ≈ 2.54 GeV. Less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

Bottom quark: about 4.1-4.7 GeV. 2m_b is about 8.2-9.4 GeV. Wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar because 2m_b > m_X. So X → b b̄ is not allowed kinematically.

Top quark: even heavier, around 173 GeV. 2m_t is way more than 6 GeV. So that's not allowed either.

Wait, but what about the other fermions like the neutrinos? Wait, in the Standard Model, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but considering non-zero, maybe? But the problem doesn't mention them, and the options don't include them, so I think we can ignore them for this problem.

So, the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are:

e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Wait, but let's check each of these:

- e+ e−: allowed (mass way below 6)
- mu+ mu−: allowed (0.21 GeV)
- tau+ tau−: 3.55 GeV, allowed
- u ū: 0.004 GeV, allowed
- d d̄: 0.01 GeV, allowed
- s s̄: 0.19 GeV, allowed
- c c̄: 2.54 GeV, allowed
- b b̄: 8.2 GeV, not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are all of these except b and t.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau tau, e e. Wait, but b b̄ is not allowed, so A can't be right.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau tau, mu mu, e e. Wait, but B has c c̄, which is allowed, and all others except top and b. So this includes c, but how about the tau and mu and e?

Wait, option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all except b and t. So that's possible.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all possible except b and t.

Wait, but what about the X boson mass? Let me think. X mass is 6 GeV, so the maximum possible pair is 6 GeV.

Wait, let me calculate 2m for each fermion.

Electron: 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV.

Muon: 2m_mu ≈ 0.21 GeV.

Tau: ~3.55 GeV.

Up: ~0.004 GeV.

Down: ~0.01 GeV.

Strange: ~0.19 GeV.

Charm: ~2.54 GeV.

Bottom: ~8.2 GeV (so not allowed).

So, all except b and t can be produced.

So, the decay products should include e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Looking at the options:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that's all except b and t, which have higher 2m_f than 6 GeV.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

Option C: includes t, which is not allowed. So C is wrong.

Option D: includes tau, mu, e, and also includes b. Oh, no, D says X→b b̄, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

So the correct answer is B, because it includes all the allowed decay channels except the ones with b and t.

Wait, but wait. The problem says, "the lowest order." Hmm. So is there any consideration about the order of the process affecting which decays are allowed?

In the Lagrangian given, the interaction is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y).

So, when considering decays, the process would be X → f f̄. The lowest order process is tree-level, which is possible if the mass is sufficient.

So, the allowed decays are any f where 2m_f ≤ m_X (6 GeV).

Yes, so all fermions except those whose 2m_f >6 GeV.

So, the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction term in the Lagrangian, \(-\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), indicates a Yukawa-like interaction, meaning \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) provided the kinematic threshold is satisfied. The kinematic condition requires that the total mass of the decay products, \( 2m_f \), is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The masses of Standard Model fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.008-0.01 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19-0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 8.2-9.4 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b > m_X \)).
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \gg m_X \) (not allowed).

### Step 2: Allowed Decay Channels
From the above analysis, the kinematically allowed decay channels of \( X \) are:
- \( X \to e^+ e^- \)
- \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( X \to u \bar{u} \)
- \( X \to d \bar{d} \)
- \( X \to s \bar{s} \)
- \( X \to c \bar{c} \)

Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) or \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed due to the high mass of these fermions.

### Step 3: Evaluating the Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which are all allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
