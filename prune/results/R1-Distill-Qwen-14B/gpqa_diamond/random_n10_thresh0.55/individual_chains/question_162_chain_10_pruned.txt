Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor tells us about the geometry of spacetime. But wait, I'm more familiar with calculating areas in Riemannian geometry. Oh right, for a 2D surface, the area can be found using the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of dx and dy, so it's in 2D. The line element is ds² = g_{11} dx² + g_{22} dy² + cross terms. But in this case, the cross terms are zero because it's diagonal. So, the metric tensor components are g_{11}=g_{22}=32/(4 - x² - y²). 

The area element dA in such a space is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal, det(g) is just (g_11)(g_22), because the off-diagonal terms are zero. So, det(g) would be (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Then sqrt(det(g)) is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, no, wait. The determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So, yes, that's correct. So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Now, I need to find the total area. That would be the double integral of dA over the region where the metric is defined. But what is the domain of x and y? Because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², it can't be zero or negative because the denominator would make the metric singular or negative. So 4 - x² - y² must be positive. That means x² + y² < 4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Because 4 is 2 squared.

So the integration is over the disk x² + y² < 4. But wait, the metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, this looks a bit similar to the metric of a sphere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can switch to polar coordinates to make the integration easier. Let me try
