Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the problem involves an electron in a state |alpha> which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. 

The question is asking for two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. 

Wait, so the operator matrix is a 2x2 matrix because it's for spin-1/2 particles. Let me write that matrix out. Since A_ij is hbar/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, the matrix looks like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

So that's the operator. Hmm, wait, but to diagonalize this matrix and find its eigenstates, I think I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Because the eigenstates of this operator are what the measurement probabilities are based on.

First, let me find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The matrix is:

[[0, A], [A, 0]], where A = hbar/2.

The eigenvalues λ are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)^2 - (A)^2 = λ² - A² = 0.

That gives λ = ± A. So the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2.

So the eigenstates will correspond to these two eigenvalues. Let me denote them as |+> and |->, for the +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 eigenstates, respectively.

Now, the eigenstates can be found by solving (A - λ I)|v> = 0.

For λ = +A (hbar/2):

The matrix becomes:

[ -A   A ]
[ A   -A ]

Which simplifies the equations to -A v1 + A v2 =0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T. But we can normalize it. So |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait no, wait, because |up> and |down> are the standard basis vectors. So |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let's check. For λ = +A, the equations are (0 - A)v1 + (A) v2 =0 → -A v1 + A v2=0 → v1 = v2. So |+> is any vector (a, a)^T. So yes, normalized to 1/sqrt(2) times (1,1).

Similarly, for λ = -A, the matrix is:

[ A   A ]
[ A   A ]

Equation: A v1 + A v2 =0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, -1)^T. So |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).
