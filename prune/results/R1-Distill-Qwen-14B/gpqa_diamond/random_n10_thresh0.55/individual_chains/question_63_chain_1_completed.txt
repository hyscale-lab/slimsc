Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let me try to think it through. The question is about a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state absorbing a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm.

First, I remember that the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model, considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. The molecule is modeled as a system where the bond can stretch and the molecule can rotate. So the energy levels are a combination of both vibrations and rotations.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state refers to the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0). But wait, no, I think the fundamental state is actually the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state, maybe J=0. Or maybe in the rigid rotor model, the lowest rotational state is J=0, but for a non-rigid rotor, it's a bit more complex. Wait, the question says it's the fundamental state, which I think is the ground state, so v=0 and J=0.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the next state would be the next higher energy state. In these models, the possible transitions follow selection rules. For diatomic molecules, I remember that for vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δv = ±1, and for rotational transitions, ΔJ = ±1. But wait, in the rotation-vibration coupling models, like the Morse potential, the transitions can involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states. But for the quantum rotation-vibration model, I think the allowed transitions are when the photon provides energy to change the vibrational state and possibly the rotational state.

Wait, the problem says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the first excited state, which would be the lowest energy higher state. So that would be increasing either the vibrational state or the rotational state, whichever requires the least energy. Because the photon's energy needs to match the energy difference between these states.

But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the (v=0, J=0) state. The next possible state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever has the lower energy. Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so which transition requires less energy—vibrational or rotational?

Hmm. Let's compute the energies for both possible transitions and see which is lower.

First, the vibrational energy levels. The formula for the energy of a vibration is E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency. But wait, the question gives angular frequency ω, so ν = ω/(2π). So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 would be ΔE_vib = (1 + 1/2) h ν - (0 + 1/2) h ν = h ν. So the photon's energy would need to be h ν.

Next, the rotational energy levels. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. Since the molecule is diatomic, I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 would be ΔE_rot = E_1 - E_0. E_0 is (0)(1)ħ²/(2I) = 0. E_1 is (1)(2)ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

We need to calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot and see which one is smaller because the photon would need to provide the energy for the lower of the two to cause the transition to the next state.

Wait, but how about the non-rigid rotor model? Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor (or Morse model) accounts for bond vibrations in the rotational energy levels. So the rotational energy levels are actually a function of the vibrational state as well. But since the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0), I think the rotational energy levels are based on that. So when it transitions to the next state, it could either increase v by 1, keeping J the same, or increase J by 1, keeping v the same, or both. But the selection rules would probably allow either, but the question is about the lowest possible energy.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, so the energy levels are a combination of both. So the next state would be the one with the lowest energy increase, which could be a change in either v or J.

Wait, perhaps to find the minimal photon energy, we need to find the transition that requires the least energy. So compute both possible ΔE and pick the smaller one.

So let's compute both.

First, let's compute ΔE_vib.

Given ω = 4e14 rad/s.

ν = ω/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.2832) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

But wait, the energy for the vibrational transition is E = h ν. So that's h multiplied by ν.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So E_vib = h * ν = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ approximately 4.222e-20 J.

Now for the rotational transition.

We need to compute ΔE_rot. It's E_J=1 - E_J=0.

E_J=1 = [ (1)(2) (ħ^2) ] / (2I) = (2 ħ²) / (2 I) = ħ² / I.

I is the moment of inertia: I = μ r².

μ is the reduced mass, which is (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y).

Masses are given in amu (atomic mass units). 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, no, wait: that's the calculation in amu, but I need to compute it in kg.

Wait, Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = (40 amu²) / (22 amu) = (40/22) amu = 1.81818... amu.

But I need μ in kg. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ approx 3.023e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.023? Hmm.

Wait, 1.818 *1.6605:

1.8 *1.6605 = ~2.989, 0.018 *1.6605≈0.0299. So total ~3.0189e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ r² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.208e-46.

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68.

1.05457^2 ≈ 1.112. So 1.112e-68.

Divide by denominator 1.208e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ (1.112/1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22.

So yeah, so ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Now, let's compare this to the vibrational energy change.

E_vib was approximately 4.222e-20 J.

So the rotational transition requires about 9.2e-23 J, which is smaller than the vibrational transition of ~4.2e-20 J.

Wait, wait, wait. That can't be right. Because 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition would require a smaller photon energy.

So to reach the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule would absorb a photon that allows it to transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), because that requires less energy.

So the photon's energy must match ΔE_rot ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states are a combination of both, so the energy levels aren't just either/or but a combination of both. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. So the question is, when the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, which transition would be the next possible state.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'next state' refers to the first excited state, which would be a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes, but I think that's more complicated. The question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy', which I think refers to the state with the next higher energy, which would be the one with the least energy difference from the ground state.

So between the two possible transitions, the rotational one requires less energy. So the photon's energy is the rotational energy difference, E_rot = ΔE_rot.

The question is about the momentum p of the photon. So we need to find p such that the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. The photon's energy is related to its frequency by E = h f = h ν.

But in terms of momentum, p = E / c, since for a photon, E = pc.

Wait, because the momentum of a photon is p = E/c. Because the relation E = pc holds for photons (since their mass is zero, E²=(pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → E=pc).

So p = E_photon / c.

So, E_photon is the rotational energy difference, which is approximately 9.2e-23 J.

c is the speed of light, approx 3e8 m/s.

Thus, p ≈ 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, so the units match.

But wait, 3e-31 kg·m/s is 3e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than the options given.

Hmm, that's an issue. So either I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, maybe I messed up the energy calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, for the rotational energy, ΔE_rot = E_J=1 - E_J=0.

E_J is given by (J (J+1) ) * (ħ²) / (2 I).

So E_J=0 is zero.

E_J=1 is (1 * 2) * ħ²/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2 I) = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

Wait, I think I may have made an error in my calculation of I.

Wait, I = μ r².

μ is (mX * mY) / (mX + mY) in kg.

Wait, mX is 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY is 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait, wait: no, wait. μ is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY).

So mX = 3.321e-26 kg.

mY = 3.321e-27 kg.

So mX + mY = 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27) / 3.6531e-26.

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.025 * 1e-53 = 1.1025e-52.

Divide by 3.6531e-26: 1.1025e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ r².

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

r² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Yes, that's the same as before.

So the photon's energy E is 9.21e-23 J.

Now, to find the momentum p of the photon.

Since E = p c → p = E / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

Compute that: 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 N·s (since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s).

But looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Hmm, none of these are close to 3e-31 Ns.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake in my approach. Because the options are way off.

Wait, perhaps I confused the model. Maybe the question refers to a diatomic molecule in rotation-vibration model, which combines both. So the energy levels are not just rotational or vibrational, but a combination. So the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the (v=0, J=0) state. The next state would be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever requires less energy.

But in our earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational, so the next state would be (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon with energy 9.2e-23 J.

But that gives a momentum way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I misapplied the model.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the absorption of a photon causes a transition to a higher vibrational state and possibly a change in rotational state. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's the first overtone or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman transition, which allows ΔJ = ±2, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the energy for the rotational transition. Let me double-check.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which would require a higher energy, and that's why the options are higher. Because the options are around 1e-27 to 1e-28, which are larger than my calculated 3e-31.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me re-express the formula.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = [ ħ² / (2 I) ] * J (J+1).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is [ (2) - 0 ] * (ħ² / (2 I)) )= 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) )= (ħ²)/(I).

Which is what I calculated earlier.

Wait, let me compute that again with precise values.

Compute I again:

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.023e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.023e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.023e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2092e-46 kg·m².

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2092e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but if the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, then p = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't have anything near that. The smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is about 1e-28. So I'm off by about 4 orders of magnitude.

Where did I go wrong?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the vibrational energy, not the rotational. Because when I calculated the vibrational energy, E_vib was 4.2e-20 J, which would lead to p = E/c = 4.2e-20 /3e8 ≈ 1.4e-28 Ns. Which matches option D.

But wait, earlier I thought the rotational transition is lower energy, but perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the vibrational energy.

Vibrational energy difference is E_vib = h ν.

ν = ω/(2π) = 4e14 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 4e14 /6.283 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So E_vib = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈ 4.222e-20 J.

So p = E/c = 4.222e-20 /3e8 = 1.407e-28 N·s.

Which is about 1.4e-28 N·s, matching option D.

But wait, earlier I calculated that the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is this option present?

Ah, perhaps because the overall energy of the rotational transition is actually higher than the vibrational one. That can't be, because 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20.

Wait, no, 9.2e-23 is 0.000092e-16, while 4.2e-20 is 0.00042e-16. So no, 9.2e-23 is smaller.

Wait, but in terms of J, 9.2e-23 J is less than 4.2e-20 J.

So why would the photon have energy corresponding to the vibrational transition?

Unless, perhaps, the molecule is in a state where the rotational levels are higher than the vibrational.

But that doesn't make sense because for diatomic molecules, the rotational energy levels are much closer together than the vibrational ones.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the energy spacing for rotational transitions is much smaller than vibrational. So the rotational transitions require less energy, which means a lower frequency photon.

So if the molecule is in the ground state, and it absorbs a photon, the next state would be the one requiring the least energy, which would be the rotational transition. But according to the options, that's not present.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the model.

Wait, perhaps the model being referred to is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, where the energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h ν and E_rot = (J (J+1))/ (2I) ħ².

So for the rigid rotor, the energy difference for J=0 → J=1 is ΔE_rot = (2/2I) ħ² = ħ²/(I).

But let me compute I again accurately.

Given:

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ is (20 *2)/(20 +2) =40/22= 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

μ = 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.023e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I = μ r²=3.023e-27 * (2e-10)^2=3.023e-27 *4e-20 =1.209e-46 kg m².

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

ΔE_rot = (ħ²)/(I)= (1.05457e-34)^2 /1.209e-46 ≈ (1.112e-68)/(1.209e-46) ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Which is about 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=9.2e-23/3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s or 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition.

Let me compute p for E_vib.

E_vib =4.222e-20 J.

p=4.222e-20 /3e8 =1.407e-28 Ns.

Which matches option D.

So why would the answer be the vibrational transition? Because perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the first vibrational state, but that doesn't align with standard terminology.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is v=0. So the next state could be v=1, which is a higher energy. But if the rotational transition is possible, why is the answer based on vibrational?

Alternatively, perhaps the model being used includes both rotational and vibrational, and the next state is a combination of both, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational calculation. Let me re-express the rotational energy difference in terms of wavenumbers or something else.

Wait another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it to move to the next highest energy state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1) and perhaps the next rotational state (J=1). But that would be a combination of both, but I'm not sure how that would be calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the rotational state, but the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me compute it again.

I think the mistake might be in the calculation of ħ²/(I). Let me compute ħ²/(I):

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

I=1.209e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.209e-46 = (1.112/1.209) *1e-22 = approx 0.919 *1e-22 = 9.19e-23 J.

So that's correct.

So if the photon's energy is 9.19e-23 J, the momentum is 3.06e-31 Ns, which is not an option.

So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about the vibrational transition only, and the rotational is ignored, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule in the fundamental rotational state, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in its ground vibrational state (v=0) but in the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be (v=0, J=1), which requires 9.2e-23 J, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is treated as a 3D rotor? No, diatomic is 2D.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the photon to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational changes. That is, it's a combination transition. But I don't think that's the case because the question says 'next state with the lowest possible energy,' which would be the smallest energy increase.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, but I can't do anything about that.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman transition, which is a two-photon process, but I don't think that's what the question is about.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. The model is the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). So the question is about the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, and the next state would be the next higher energy state. So perhaps that's a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes.

But the question states "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy," which would be the state with the least energy above the ground state. So the state that has the least ΔE.

So between the (v=0, J=1) and (v=1, J=0) states, which has a lower energy?

The energy of (v=0, J=1) is E_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

The energy of (v=1, J=0) is E_vib =4.2e-20 J.

So clearly, the rotational transition is lower. So the photon should have 9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 Ns, which is not in the options.

But the options have 1.4e-28 Ns, which is E_vib, which is much larger. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator. But the non-rigid rotor would have a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first overtone or some other transition.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. It says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is v=0, but what about the rotational state? In the rigid rotor model, the ground state is J=0, but for a non-rigid rotor, perhaps it's different.

Wait, perhaps the model being used has J as a function of v. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which requires the vibrational energy. That would give p=1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

But then why the rotational transition would have a lower energy. Unless I made a mistake in the rotational calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating I.

Wait, let me check I again.

μ = m_X * m_Y / (m_X + m_Y).

m_X = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

m_Y = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

μ = (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27).

Wait, denominator is 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.6531e-26 kg.

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53.

3.321^2 ≈ 11.025.

So numerator is 11.025e-53 kg².

Denominator is 3.6531e-26 kg.

μ= 11.025e-53 / 3.6531e-26 = (11.025 /3.6531) * 1e-27 ≈ 3.018 *1e-27 kg.

So μ=3.018e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I= μ r² =3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

Yes.

So I think the calculations are correct. But the options don't have the calculated value, which suggests perhaps the intended answer is based on the vibrational transition. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the model being considered treats the molecule as a three-dimensional rigid rotor, but diatomic is two-dimensional.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is referring to the energy of the photon as the sum of both rotational and vibrational changes. But that's more complicated and not necessary, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon to cause a transition to the next higher state, which could be a combination of both, but that's unclear.

Given all that, I'm stuck. My calculations for the rotational transition don't match any of the options, but the vibrational transition gives an option that is present (option D). So perhaps the intended answer is D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition but I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of angular frequency, not linear frequency.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = ħ ω_rot J (J+1), where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is given by E_J = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I).

Wait, I think that's correct. So perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of its own frequency.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, B is (ħ²)/(2 I k), where k is the rotational constant in spectroscopy terms.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the rotational energy in terms of B. But without knowing B, perhaps I can compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the moment of inertia I to find the rotational frequency.

Wait, the rotational frequency ν_rot is given by ν_rot = ħ/(2 π I) * J (J+1).

But for J=1, it's ν_rot = ħ/(2 π I) * 2 = 2 ħ/(2 π I) )= ħ/(π I).

Wait, but that's probably not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy E_J can be expressed as E_J = (J (J+1)) * (ħ ω_rot ), where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

But I don't have ω_rot given, only ω_vib =4e14 rad/s.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational energies are coupled. So the energy levels are a product of both. But I'm not familiar enough with that model to proceed.

Given that, and considering time constraints, perhaps the intended answer is D, which corresponds to the vibrational transition. So I'll go with option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (\(v=0\)) and the lowest rotational state (\(J=0\)). The goal is to identify the energy difference for the transition to the next state with the lowest energy and calculate the corresponding photon momentum.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are given by \(E_v = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \nu\), where \(\nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}\).
   - The angular frequency is \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\), so \(\nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}\).
   - The energy difference for the vibrational transition (\(v=0 \to v=1\)) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.222 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \(E_J = \frac{\hbar^2 J (J+1)}{2I}\), where \(I = \mu r^2\) is the moment of inertia.
   - The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu}) (2 \, \text{amu})}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.023 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
   - The bond length is \(r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), so the moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.023 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.209 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition (\(J=0 \to J=1\)) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.209 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition requires \(\Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.222 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}\), while the rotational transition requires \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).
   - Since \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} < \Delta E_{\text{vib}}\), the rotational transition requires less energy. However, the photon momentum corresponding to \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}}\) is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns},
     \]
     which does not match any of the provided options.

4. **Vibrational Transition Momentum**:
   - If the photon energy corresponds to the vibrational transition (\(\Delta E_{\text{vib}}\)), the momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.222 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
   - This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition, but the calculated momentum for the rotational transition does not match the provided options. Based on the options, the intended answer corresponds to the vibrational transition.
