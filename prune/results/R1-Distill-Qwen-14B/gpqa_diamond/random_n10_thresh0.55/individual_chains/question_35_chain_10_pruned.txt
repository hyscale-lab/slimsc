Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another matrix. The S matrix has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I should probably write that down.

Wait, let me get the matrix S correct. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Right, and c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's recall that the eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let me compute the matrix Ay. So, Ay is c times S, so each element is multiplied by c. So:

Ay = [ [0*c, (-i)*c],
       [i*c, 0*c] ]
Which is [ [0, -i * (h/(4π)) ],
          [i * (h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

Now, the eigenvalues a are found by solving the determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ -a, -i h/(4π)  ]
[ i h/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Compute that determinant: a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ].

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1. So (-i * i) = -i² = 1. So the determinant equation becomes a² - (1) * (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0.

So a² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). Hmm, but wait, let me compute that correctly. Because (h/(4π)) squared is h²/(16 π²), right? So a could be plus or minus that. So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second, the matrix S is a Pauli matrix, isn't it? Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and S looks exactly like the Y Pauli matrix, except maybe for a factor. Let me recall, the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So S matrix exactly matches σy. Oh wait, so S is σy. So then Ay = c σy.

Now
