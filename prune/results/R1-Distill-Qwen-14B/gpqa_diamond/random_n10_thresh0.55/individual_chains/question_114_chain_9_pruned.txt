Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part is about a reaction involving butan-2-one. The reagents used are NaCN and another reagent A, which results in 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which act as nucleophiles. So in the presence of a base, maybe?

Wait, no, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If we add NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. The ketone would react with the cyanide ion. So the product would have the CN group added to the carbonyl carbon. But what's the exact structure here?

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group (CN) is on the second carbon, along with a hydroxyl (OH) and a methyl group. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe I got the structure wrong. Wait, butanenitrile would be a four-carbon chain with CN at the end. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Or maybe I should number it differently. Alternatively, perhaps it
