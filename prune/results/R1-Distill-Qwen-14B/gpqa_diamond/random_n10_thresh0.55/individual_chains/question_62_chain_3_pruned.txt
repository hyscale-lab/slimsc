Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target. So, the molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking it down, the main chain is cyclohexane with a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached to carbon 1. Also, attached to the same carbon is a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, so the carbon 1 has three substituents: cyclohexyl, hydroxymethyl, and the aldehyde group? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. The compound is named as 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group at position 1. Then, at position 1, there's also a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, that can't be right because position 1 on the cyclohexane would already have the aldehyde. Oh, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde, meaning it's a branch. So the structure would have the aldehyde group attached to a carbon that also has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. So it's like:

The main ring is cyclohexane, and on one of its carbons (probably position 1), there's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group also attached to the aldehyde. Wait, no, the aldehyde is on that same carbon as the substituents. So maybe the structure is like cyclohexane ring with
