Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm. So, I think stability constants are involved here. Stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex. Wait, what's the order? I think β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is the second complex [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, and so on.

So the complexes would be:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9
- [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ → β2=40
- [Co(SCN)₃]^3− → β3=63
- [Co(SCN)₄]^4− → β4=16

Wait, but wait a second. The stability constant β is for each step. So β1 is the formation constant for the first ligand adding. So, the overall formation constant for the second complex would be β1 * β2, right? Or wait, no, each β is the cumulative constant for that level. Let me think again. I think for the nth complex, βn is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 = K1, β2 = K1*K2, etc. Or wait, no, I think each βn is the stepwise formation constant. For example, β1 is the constant for adding the first ligand, β2 is the constant for adding the second, and so on. So the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(n−) would be the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Stability constants can be either stepwise or overall. In
