Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The reaction typically forms an enolate intermediate. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each one is a different Michael addition reaction, and I need to find their major products from the options given.

Starting with reaction A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. So, dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid, which is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate easily. The other component, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the Michael acceptor because it has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl system.

Wait, in the Michael reaction, the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So the donor (malonate) will form an enolate, which will attack the acceptor. 

Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it forms an enolate, it loses a proton from one of the alpha carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl). The enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. Then, this enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

The acceptor is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the E isomer. Wait, no, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OEt. But the structure here is 3-(p-tolyl), which would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO-OCH3? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) acrylate would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Or is it:

The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3 position is where the p-tolyl group is attached. So the structure is CH2-CH-(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3? Wait, maybe it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-OR but with the substituent on the central carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3, but that doesn't quite make sense. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure as CH2=CH-C
