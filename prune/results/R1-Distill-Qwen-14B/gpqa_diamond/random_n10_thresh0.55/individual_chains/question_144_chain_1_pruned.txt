Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Gamma_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with different values in meters.

Wait, what's a meson resonance? From what I remember, mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like particles that don't exist long enough to be detected directly; they decay very quickly. Their existence is inferred from the products of their decay.

So the mean decay distance must be how far the meson travels before decaying. Since it's produced, it can move a tiny bit before breaking apart. The decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity.

I think the formula for mean decay length (L) is L = gamma * v * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and tau is the proper lifetime. But wait, how do I find tau?

Oh right, the proper lifetime tau is related to the particle's width Gamma. The width Gamma is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The relation is Gamma = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Gamma. But wait, actually, the natural line width is Gamma, and since the uncertainty principle says that delta E * delta t ~ ħ, so delta t is about ħ/(2 Gamma), but for rough calculations, we can approximate tau as ħ/(Gamma).

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The width Gamma is given in MeV, which is energy. The lifetime tau can be found from the uncertainty principle: Gamma * tau ≈ ħ. So tau ≈ ħ / Gamma. But I should make sure about the units.

Gamma is given in MeV. To compute tau, I need to convert it into seconds. Let me recall the constants. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and MeV is 1e-3 GeV. So Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So Gamma = 0.32 GeV. Then tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really small. But that's okay for a resonance.

Next, I need to find the velocity v. To find v, I can use the energy and mass. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV. So its relativistic energy is E = gamma m c^2. Since E is much larger than m, the velocity v is approximately c.

But wait, m_X is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So gamma would be E / (m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6
