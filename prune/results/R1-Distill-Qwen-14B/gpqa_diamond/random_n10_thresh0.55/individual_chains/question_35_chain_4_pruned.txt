Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices, and spin-½ particles have specific properties. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I can write S as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S. So substituting c, that would make Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Right, eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. But wait, maybe I can think about S first, because it's simpler. Since Ay is just a scalar multiple of S, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. So if I find the eigenvalues of S, multiply each by c, and that gives me the eigenvalues of Ay.

So let's find the eigenvalues of S. The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0.

Matrix S - λ I is:

[[-λ, -i],
 [i, -λ]]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) ). Wait, what's (-i)(i)? Oh, (-i)*i equals -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - (1) = 0. So λ² = 1 => λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay, which is c*S, will be c*(+1) and c*(-1). Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a will be h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Looking at the options, let's see which ones match. Option A says the imaginary part are +2πh or –2πh, and the real parts are +h/(4π) or –h/(
