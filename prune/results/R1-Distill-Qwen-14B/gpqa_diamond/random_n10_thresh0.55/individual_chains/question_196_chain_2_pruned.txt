Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, the question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass. Let me think about what I know.

So, the setup is a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're supposed to find v_max, the maximum speed, and there are four options given.

Wait, I remember that in the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So in the non-relativistic case, when all potential is converted, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv², which gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so it's not that simple.

In relativity, as speed approaches the speed of light c, the mass increases due to Lorentz factor gamma. So the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the total energy includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The total energy E of a relativistic particle is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. In the non-relativistic case, they both are (1/2)kA². But relativ
