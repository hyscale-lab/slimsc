Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. Hmm, the problem is about calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Let's break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, 2e? Oh right, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each particle has a charge of 2 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-19 coulombs. Got it.

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, I think this means that the 12 charges are all located at points that are 2 meters away from P. So P is the position of the 13th charge, which is fixed. The 12 others are each 2 meters away from P.

Wait, but how are these 12 arranged? Since they're all 2 meters from P, they form a spherical shell around P, right? But since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement further, maybe we can assume they're equally spaced on a sphere. But wait, maybe the exact arrangement doesn't matter for calculating the potential energy, because when you calculate the potential energy for a system of point charges, you sum over all pairs. Or wait, maybe in this case, because the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P (the 13th charge), we can compute their potential energies relative to the 13th charge and then see about the potential energy among themselves.

Wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So the system's total electrostatic potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Since the charges are identical and all the same sign (since each is 2e, so positive), they'll repel each other.

Wait, but the system is isolated, so we're just considering the electrostatic potential energy among all the charges.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. So the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. Additionally, each of the 12 is some distance away from each other. Wait, but the problem says they are
