Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that causes a transition in the molecule's state. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it incorporates both rotational and vibrational energies.

The molecule is currently in its fundamental state. Wait, the fundamental state—oh right, that's the lowest energy state. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest state. Since it's the next state, I think it's the first excited state.

I need to find the momentum of this photon. Momentum of a photon is related to its energy, right? Because for photons, E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So if I can find the energy of the photon, I can find the momentum by dividing by c.

But wait, what kind of transition are we talking about here? The problem says it's a diatomic molecule, so the states likely involve both rotational and vibrational transitions. But when they say the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think it refers to the next higher state overall. So the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are given by a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0), and the rotational states are quantized as well, with quantum number J.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is (ħ²J(J+1))/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, maybe it's a bit more complicated, but perhaps for this problem, we can treat the rotational part using the rigid rotor formula.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think the molecule is in its ground state (v=0, J=0), and the photon causes a transition to the next possible state, which would be either increasing J or increasing v. But which transition has the lower energy?

Vibrational transitions usually require higher energy than rotational ones because the vibrational energy levels are more closely spaced but each step (from v=0 to v=1) might require more energy than a rotational transition (J=0 to J=1).

Wait no, actually, the spacing between rotational energy levels is smaller than vibrational. Wait, the rotational energy levels are spaced by E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) * J(J+1), so for J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by (ħ²/(2I))(2). For vibrational, the energy difference is (1/2) m ω² (from v=0 to v=1). So which is larger?

Let me compute both. Maybe the energy needed for a vibrational transition is higher than the rotational one. So if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state could be either J=1 or v=1. The lower energy transition would be the rotational one, so the photon would cause a change in J.

But wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh, the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational state, which is v=0. But maybe the rotational state is also the lowest, J=0. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be J=1, because the energy for J=1 is higher than J=0 but lower than v=1.

So the photon would cause a transition from J=0 to J=1, without any change in vibrational state. Therefore, the energy of the photon is the energy difference between J=1 and J=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state includes a change in both rotation and vibration. But I think the problem is considering the next state in terms of the total energy, so the smallest possible energy increase, which would be a rotational transition.

Wait, but maybe in the quantum
