Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light.

First, I need to find the mean lifetime τ. I think the relation involves the decay width Γ. Oh yeah, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the decay width Γ. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, but wait, Γ is usually given in energy units, so I need to be careful with the units.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh right, because when you have natural units, ħ c is about 197 MeV·fm or something like that, but perhaps I'll get to that later.

So, Γ is given as 320 MeV. But wait, ħ is in GeV·s. So I should convert Γ from MeV to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Then τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = let me compute that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. I'll note that down as τ ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Next, I need the velocity β. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV and mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, I can calculate its velocity.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². But since we're working in natural units where c=1 and using GeV, I can ignore
