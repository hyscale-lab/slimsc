Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, implying it's not necessarily in a normalized form.

The problem then asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Wait, so what does that matrix look like?

Assuming it's a 2x2 matrix since the state is in a two-level system (up and down are spin eigenstates). So the matrix would be:

A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

That's because for i != j, it's hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Hmm. This looks familiar. Oh, right! The Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our A is (hbar/2)*X.

So the operator A is proportional to the Pauli X operator. Therefore, the eigenstates of A should be the same as the eigenstates of X. The eigenstates of X are the eigenstates where the spin is in the x-direction, say |+x> and |-x>.

But wait, the eigenstates of the operator A are the same as those of X because A is a multiple of X. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues would be the corresponding values multiplied by hbar/2.

So the next part is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. To do that, I think I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Because the probability is the square of the amplitude of each eigenstate in |alpha>.

So first, let me write down |alpha>.

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>

But since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z (the z-component of spin), I need to express them in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are the x-basis states.

Wait, or perhaps I should find the expansion of |alpha> in the x-basis. Alternatively, I can think of it as finding the components of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, which is the eigenbasis of X, so the |+x> and |-x> states.

The eigenstates of X are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me confirm that. Yes, because X|+x> = (hbar/2)(|down> + |up> ) = (hbar/2) sqrt(2) |+x> for eigenvalue hbar/2. So eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, but for the probabilities, the eigenvalues don't matter for the probabilities, just the states.

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I need to compute the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the probabilities by diagonalizing the operator A and finding the projections. Wait, but since A is proportional to X, perhaps another approach is to compute the expectation value, but the question is about the probabilities of each eigenstate, not the expectation value.

Wait, the problem asks for the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of the operator A. So, each possible outcome corresponds to an eigenvalue, which is the eigenstate. So, when you measure the operator A, the possible results are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with probabilities given by the square of the coefficients in the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

But first, let's normalize the state |alpha>.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So let's compute the norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the expansion of |alpha> in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

We can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>

Our goal is to find c_+ and c_-.

First, express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, plugging into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) 

= [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, express this as a combination of |+x> and |-x>:

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination.

Let me substitute |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

From the expressions for |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)

|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ 1/sqrt(2) [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ) ] ] / sqrt(7)

= [1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))] [ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i))|-x> ]

Wait, let's compute the coefficients inside:

Let me expand each term.

First term: (1+i) (|+x> + |-x>) = (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x>

Second term: (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x>) = (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x>

So when we add these together:

( (1+i) + (2 -i) ) |+x> + ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) |-x> 

Compute each coefficient:

For |+x>: (1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 + 0i =3

For |-x>: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i ) = (-1) + 2i

So now we have:

[3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

So the coefficients are:

c_+ = 3 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

c_- = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Wait, but the coefficients shouldn't have any imaginary parts if the expansion is correct, but perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute the expansion:

Adding the |+x> terms:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i. So yes, correct.

Adding the |-x> terms:

(1+i) from the first term, and -(2 -i) from the second term.

So (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i. So correct.

So the coefficients are c_+ =3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) and c_- = (-1+2i)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, but wait a second. The state |alpha> should be a linear combination of |+x> and |-x> with real coefficients? Or can they be complex? Well, the state can have complex coefficients, but when taking the inner product for probabilities, we take the modulus squared.

So, the probability of finding the particle in the |+x> state is |c_+|^2, and the probability for |-x> is |c_-|^2.

Let's compute these.

Compute |c_+|^2:

|3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))|^2 = (9) / (2 *7) ) = 9/(14) ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36 for the probabilities. So 0.64 is close to 9/14 (which is about 0.6428). Let me compute 9/14 exactly: 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, but let me compute |c_-|^2.

c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / (2*7) ) = (1 +4 )/(14) )=5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

But looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36. 0.64 is close to 9/14 ≈0.6428, which would be approximately 64.29%. 0.36 is 36%, which is close to 5/14 ≈35.71%. So the probabilities would be about 64.3% and 35.7%, but let me check if 9/14 is exactly 0.642857.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the coefficient calculation? Because the state |alpha> is written as a combination of |+x> and |-x>, but perhaps I made an error in the expansion.

Wait, let me double-check the expansion.

When I substituted |up> and |down> into |alpha>, I think I did it correctly.

Let me re-express |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) [ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |-x> ] ]

Wait, (1+i) + (2 -i) is 3. And (1 +i) - (2 -i) is (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i. So that's correct.

So, c_+ is 3/(sqrt(14)), c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2/(14) =9/14 ≈0.6428.

|c_-|^2: | (-1 + 2i) |^2 /14 = (1 +4)/(14)=5/14≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. So that's the closest. But wait, let me check the options.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Wait, but the average value is the third part of the problem.

So the average value of operator A is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is given as a matrix, perhaps I can compute this expectation value.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, and the expectation value of Pauli X is the same as the expectation value of A divided by (hbar/2).

Wait, but let me compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

But in terms of the Pauli matrices, X = [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A = (hbar/2) X.

So <A> = (hbar/2) <alpha| X |alpha>.

The expectation value of X in state |alpha> is [ <up| + <down| ] (X |alpha> ) / sqrt(7)}.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

But |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So <alpha| is [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 +i) <down| ] / sqrt(7).

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]

So compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> )/sqrt(7) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as a matrix product.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then <A> is the conjugate transpose multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So let's compute:

First, the conjugate transpose (bra) is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ].

Multiply by matrix A:

A = [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]

So, the product of the bra and A:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) *0 + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * hbar/2 , ... ] Wait, perhaps more accurately, the multiplication is:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * A = [ ( (2 + i) * (hbar/2) ) / sqrt(7), ( (1 - i) * (hbar/2) ) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the entire expectation value.

Alternatively, let me compute <alpha| A |alpha> as:

sum_{i,j} (alpha_i^* A_ij alpha_j )

Where alpha_i are the components of |alpha>.

So alpha_1 = (1+i)/sqrt(7), alpha_2 = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

< A > = (alpha_1^* * A_11 * alpha_1 ) + (alpha_1^* * A_12 * alpha_2 ) + (alpha_2^* * A_21 * alpha_1 ) + (alpha_2^* * A_22 * alpha_2 )

But A_11 = 0, A_22 =0.

So only the cross terms remain.

So,

< A > = alpha_1^* * A_12 * alpha_2 + alpha_2^* * A_21 * alpha_1

But A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2.

So,

= (alpha_1^* * (hbar/2) * alpha_2 ) + (alpha_2^* * (hbar/2) * alpha_1 )

Factor out hbar/2:

= (hbar/2) [ alpha_1^* alpha_2 + alpha_2^* alpha_1 ]

= (hbar/2) * 2 Re( alpha_1^* alpha_2 )

Because alpha_1^* alpha_2 + alpha_2^* alpha_1 = 2 Re( alpha_1^* alpha_2 )

So,

< A > = hbar Re( alpha_1^* alpha_2 )

Compute alpha_1^* alpha_2:

alpha_1^* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7)
alpha_2 = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So,

alpha_1^* alpha_2 = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] /7

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i):

= 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 

= 2 -i -2i -1 (since i^2 = -1)

= (2-1) + (-i -2i) 

= 1 -3i

So,

alpha_1^* alpha_2 = (1 -3i)/7

The real part is 1/7.

So,

< A > = hbar * (1/7) ) = hbar /7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has average value hbar/7, which matches.

So the average value is hbar/7, which is option A's third part.

Now, the probabilities were approximately 9/14 and 5/14, which are about 0.6429 and 0.3571.

But looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. These are very close, so that's probably the correct choice.

But wait, let me check the other options. What about the average value in option A. It says hbar/7, which matches our calculation. So the probabilities would be 9/14 (≈0.643) and 5/14 (≈0.357). So 0.64 is close to 9/14 (0.6428) and 0.36 is close to 5/14 (0.3571 or 0.357 approximately).

So the first part of the answer (probabilities) would be approximately 0.64 and 0.36. The average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So this must be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \hbar/2 \\ \hbar/2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we rewrite \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Expanding \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we get:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)\frac{|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} + (2-i)\frac{|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Simplifying, we find the coefficients of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
c_{+} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_{-} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are given by the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(|+x\rangle) = |c_{+}|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(|-x\rangle) = |c_{-}|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), matching the first two values in option A.

Next, we calculate the average value of \( A \). Using the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_X \), where \( \sigma_X \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, we compute:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_X | \alpha \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_X \) in \( |\alpha\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_X \rangle = \text{Re}(\alpha_1^* \alpha_2),
\]

where \( \alpha_1 = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( \alpha_2 = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Calculating \( \alpha_1^* \alpha_2 \):

\[
\alpha_1^* \alpha_2 = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}.
\]

The real part is \( \text{Re}(\alpha_1^* \alpha_2) = \frac{1}{7} \). Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

This matches the third value in option A. Combining all results, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
