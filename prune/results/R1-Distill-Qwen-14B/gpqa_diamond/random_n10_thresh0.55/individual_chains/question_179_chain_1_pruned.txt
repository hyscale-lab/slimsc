Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question involves four matrices—W, X, Y, Z—and four options about their properties. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through each part carefully.

First, let me list out the matrices again for clarity.

W is a 3x3 matrix:
Row 1: 0, 0, 1
Row 2: 0, 1, 0
Row 3: 1, 0, 0

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Y is:
Row 1: 0.5, 0.1, 0.2
Row 2: 0.1, 0.25, 0.1
Row 3: 0.2, 0.1, 0.25

Z is:
Row 1: 3, 2i, 5
Row 2: -2i, -2, -4i
Row 3: 5,4i,4

The options are A, B, C, D. I need to evaluate each statement based on these matrices.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm, e^X is the matrix exponential of X. For a vector, multiplying by e^X would change its state. But the question is about the norm. The norm change depends on whether X is Hermitian or not. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the evolution operator is unitary, which requires that the matrix is Hermitian because the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix is unitary. So if X is not Hermitian, then e^X won't be unitary, meaning it might not preserve the norm.

Wait, but what's the condition for the norm to be preserved? For a unitary matrix U, we have U† U = I. So if e^X is unitary, then e^X multiplied by a vector would preserve the norm. But if e^X is not unitary, then the norm can change.

So I need to check if X is Hermitian. Because if X is Hermitian, then e^X is not necessarily unitary, but wait, no. The exponential of a Hermitian matrix is not unitary unless multiplied by i. Because the evolution operator is e^(-iH), where H is Hermitian. So e^X alone, if X is Hermitian, would not be unitary unless X is purely imaginary. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, X is given. Let me check if X is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Let me compute X†.

X has elements:
Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [
