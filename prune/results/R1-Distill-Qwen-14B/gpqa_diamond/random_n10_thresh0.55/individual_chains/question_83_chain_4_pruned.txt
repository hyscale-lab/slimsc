Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which affects the pH. And during titration with a strong base like NaOH, the pH will change based on how much base has been added.

First, let's tackle the initial dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? So the new concentration would be half because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. I think the next step is to find the initial pH before adding NaOH, but actually, the question is about pH during titration. Oh right, the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So for the titration, we're adding NaOH to the diluted acetic acid. Let's think about the equivalence point first because I think that's a common calculation.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. Let me calculate the moles here. The diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M in 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So moles = concentration × volume. 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH is 0.1 M. The volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic.

So the concentration of acetate ions in solution: Let's see. The total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). The moles of acetate is 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A-) acts as a base. The Kb for acetate can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait, for the acetate ion, the reaction is A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-. So Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of OH- can be found using the Kb expression.

Let me set up the expression. Kb = [HA][OH-] / [A-]. Assuming x is the concentration of OH- produced, then Kb ≈ x² / (0.02), since [A-] is 0.02 M. So x² = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.08
