Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The more massive the planet and the closer it is to the star, the bigger the shift, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the main differences are the Doppler shifts observed: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula I recall is something like V = (G * (M_planet) / (M_star * a))^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star))^(1/3), but wait, when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, that term becomes negligible. So maybe it's approximated as V ~ (G*M_planet/(M_star * a))^(1/3) * something. Or perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude, K.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * P)^(-1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ] * ( (2Ï€)/P )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think of it another way. Another approach I remember is that the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period and distance. But wait, I think the key here is that for the same star mass, the Doppler shift (K) is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (a * (M_star)^(1/3)) ), but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/a^(1/3)) ), but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, maybe I should recall that for the same star mass, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (a * (M_*^2)^(1/3} )) ) or something like that.
