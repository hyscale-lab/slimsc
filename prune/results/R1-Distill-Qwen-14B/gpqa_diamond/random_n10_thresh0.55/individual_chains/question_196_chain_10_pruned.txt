Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a 1D relativistic scenario. The setup is that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I probably can't use the classical formulas directly.

Wait, relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the system's total energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy from the spring, right? Oh wait, wait. No, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², right? Or wait, no, in the classical case, maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, does that change?

Wait, the problem says it's a relativistic oscillator, so I think we need to use the relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.

So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. Or wait, maybe the potential energy is part of the total
