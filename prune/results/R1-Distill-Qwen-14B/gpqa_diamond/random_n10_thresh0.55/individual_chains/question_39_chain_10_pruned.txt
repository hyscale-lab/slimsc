Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle.

So, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. Wait, but wait, wave functions usually have some normalization condition, right? Oh right, the integral of the probability density must equal 1. So I need to normalize this wave function.

Wait, but the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function is zero outside this region, but the given expression is valid where the particle exists. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3. So the normalization integral should be from 1 to 3.

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that seems a bit strange. Because wave functions for particles are usually real or can have complex parts, but in this case, the expression includes an imaginary component. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, and the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So the probability density here would be |ψ|^2.

So to find 'a', I need to integrate |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

Wait, so let's compute |ψ|^2. The wave function ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus
