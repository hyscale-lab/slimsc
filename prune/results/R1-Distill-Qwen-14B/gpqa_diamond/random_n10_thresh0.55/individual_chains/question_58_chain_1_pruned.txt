Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite results that don't make physical sense. So regularization is a way to make these infinities manageable, right? It's a part of the process to renormalize the theory, which means removing the infinities to get finite, physical predictions.

So, regularization is needed when the theory has these divergences. Which of these theories don't have such issues? Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Oh, I think string theory in general is supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences as point particle theories. Because strings are extended objects, their interactions might be different. I remember that string theory is supposed to be finite, meaning it doesn't require renormalization. So regularization wouldn't be needed here. But wait, is that right? I think in string theory, the perturbative expansion might have divergences, but since the theory is background-independent and has a different structure, maybe it doesn't require the same kind of regularization as other quantum field theories. Or perhaps it's because string theory operates at a higher level, so divergences are handled differently.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD does require renormalization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get these divergences. These are handled by renormalization techniques. So yes, regularization is used in QCD, like using methods such as dimensional regularization to make the calculations work.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I definitely remember that QED requires renormalization. The famous example is the calculation of the electron's charge, where you get divergent integrals, so you have to renormalize the charge, mass, etc. So regularization is needed here too. Without it, QED would give nonsensical infinite results.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve the same kind of quantum divergences. Classical electromagnetism is
