Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, from the perspective of a laboratory observer. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab.

Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on how relative velocities work with light and different media. I remember that in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But this isn't in a vacuumâ€”it's in glass. So the speed of light in the glass is normally c/n, where n is the refractive index. But what happens when the glass itself is moving?

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving forward, and the light is moving forward within the glass. From the lab frame, how does this affect the observed speed of the light?

I think this is a problem involving relative velocity, but I'm not sure if it's as straightforward as adding velocities. Because when dealing with light and moving media, the usual Galilean addition (v' = v + u) might not apply. Oh, right, because in special relativity, velocities don't simply add like that when approaching the speed of light. But wait, the problem doesn't mention relativity, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the medium's motion affecting the light's speed as observed in the lab. Let me think. The glass is moving, so from the lab's frame, the glass's velocity is v. The light's speed in the glass is c/n. So does the lab see the light moving at (c/n) plus v, because the glass is moving towards them?

Wait, but wait. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So if the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, and the light is moving through the glass at speed u = c/n in the same direction, then from the lab frame, the speed of the light would be u + v? But that would be (c/n) + v. But wait, this is under the assumption of Galilean relativity, which is okay for velocities much less than c, but since the problem says c=1, maybe it's okay. Wait, but the options don't have a term like (1 + v)/n. Let
