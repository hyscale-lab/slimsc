Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents from the options given. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, so first, I'll break down each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and A. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, what happens? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. Specifically, the cyano group (CN-) is a nucleophile. So, in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps?

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, the ketone would react with CN- via an addition. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but wait—when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right, right. So, the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin.

But in this case, the reagent is NaCN. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but for the addition to happen, you usually need an acid catalyst. Because HCN is a weak acid, and in basic conditions, the CN- might not react as readily. So, perhaps the reaction is done under acidic conditions.

Wait, but in the presence of NaCN and an acid, like H3O+? Or maybe it's a two-step process. When you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide, under acidic conditions, it can form the cyanohydrin. Because I think the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen,
