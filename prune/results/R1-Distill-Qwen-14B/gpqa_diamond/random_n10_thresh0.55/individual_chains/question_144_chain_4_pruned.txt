Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's definitely a tiny distance.

Wait, from what I remember, the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the proper lifetime τ is given by the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). Then, the decay distance would be the velocity times the lifetime, L = v * τ. But wait, beta times c multiplied by τ, maybe?

Wait, no, let me get this right. The decay length depends on the particle's speed and how long it lives. The lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by the width Γ. Since Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy uncertainty in the particle's mass. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ in units of GeV·s? Let me think about the units. Oh right, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So when Γ is in GeV, τ would be in seconds.

But wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So ħ is about 6.58e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.58e-25 / 0.32. Let me compute that. 6.58 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56, so 20.56e-25 seconds. So τ ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds?

Wait, 6.58e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.58 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.58 / 0.32 is about 20.5625, so 20.56e-25 is 2.056e-24 seconds. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, to find the decay distance,
