Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully. So the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. I need to find the final product from the options A to D.

First, I'll analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

Looking at the 1H-NMR:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group (-CHO) in the molecule. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two other protons, perhaps adjacent to a CH2 group or something similar.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. This could be aromatic protons. The downfield shift suggests it's attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro or hydroxyl group. Wait, but the molecular formula has an O and N. Oh, wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So one N and one O. The aldehyde would account for the O. So maybe the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. The upfield shift compared to 6.98 suggests perhaps a different substitution pattern or adjacent substituents. Maybe para-substituted.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad signals can be due to phenolic OH protons, but they are usually even broader and might appear as singlets. Alternatively, maybe it's some kind of coupling with neighboring protons in an aromatic ring but in a symmetric position, making it a singlet. Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure yet.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for 2H. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. Maybe it's a methylene group (CH2O) attached to something else, like an aldehyde or another aromatic ring.

Putting this together, I'm thinking the molecule has an aldehyde group,
