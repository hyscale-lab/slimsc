Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So how does that affect things?

I think Gauss's Law is going to be important here. Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge. So, for points outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor plus the charge inside the cavity.

Wait, but the conductor itself is uncharged. So, the charges on the conductor must balance any enclosed charges. Let me think. The cavity has a charge +q. Since the conductor was neutral, the charges inside would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Oh right! The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) would have an induced charge of -q, because the charge +q in the cavity attracts negative charges. Then, the outer surface must have a charge +q to keep the conductor neutral overall. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, the inner surface has -q, so the outer must be +q.

But wait, the conductor as a whole is neutral. So yes, inner surface -q, outer surface +q.

So, for a point outside the conductor (like point P), the electric field would be due to the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. That surface would be outside the conductor, so it encloses the +q on the outer surface. But, wait, the +q on the outer surface is the same as the charge in the cavity, but arranged on the outer surface.

Wait, but the Gaussian surface is outside the conductor. So, the total enclosed charge would be the sum of the charges inside the conductor. The conductor itself is uncharged, but the cavity's charge is +q. So, the Gaussian surface would enclose the conductor and the +q charge.

But wait, the conductor's net charge is zero. So the Gaussian surface which is outside the conductor would enclose the +q in the cavity. Or wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So when you consider a point outside the conductor, the electric field would be as if all the charge is concentrated at the center? Or is the charge distributed in a certain way that affects the field?

Wait, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. So the charges redistribute themselves on the surfaces. The inner surface has -q, the outer has +q.

So, when looking at a point outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface would enclose the entire conductor, including the +q on the outer surface. So the total charge enclosed is +q.
