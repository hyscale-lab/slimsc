Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a Ca-EDTA complex is present. Let me read the details again.

The solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which I guess means that the EDTA is in its proper form to complex with Ca²+. The temperature is 25°C, which probably isn't affecting much here. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, what do I know about EDTA complexes? EDTA is a chelating agent that forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is like CaY²− where Y is the EDTA^4−. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²−, and Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but in this problem, the given K is KCa-EDTA. Oh, I think that's the same as the formation constant Kf. So Kf = 5e10.

The solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think that [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But wait, when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

So the setup is: the complex dissociates, and we need to find [Ca²+], given the Kf.

Let me set up the equation. Let's let the concentration of CaEDTA²− be 0.02 M. When it dissociates, each mole releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. But the dissociation is probably minimal because Kf is a large number, which means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the assumption is that x is small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate.

Wait, but wait another second. EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so typically, when it complexes with a metal ion, the reaction is:

M^n+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ M-EDTA^{m-}, where m is the charge accordingly. In the case of Ca²+, it's Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA^2−.

So, the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

We know the initial concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Let's denote the change as x, which is the amount that dissociates. So, the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Because when the complex dissociates, each mole produces
