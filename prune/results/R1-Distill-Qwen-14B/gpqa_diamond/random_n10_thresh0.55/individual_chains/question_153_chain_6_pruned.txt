Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question presents three different Michael addition reactions and asks about their products. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile (like an enolate) on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile typically attacks the beta carbon, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond formation.

Let me look at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH. So NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. In the presence of a base, dimethyl malonate would form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can easily form an enolate when deprotonated. The other component is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor here.

When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of the acrylate, the nucleophile (enolate) adds to the carbonyl group. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me think, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be substituting at the gamma position? Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt or something else.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait no, the name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is prop-2-enoate, right? So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent at the 3-position. So the structure would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl group is on C3 (the carbonyl is on C3), so the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. The 3 position would be the methylene group next to the carbonyl. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the CH2, making it CH2(C6H4-p-tolyl)=CHCO
