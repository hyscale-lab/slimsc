Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Given the density matrix ρ equals (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|), what is its geometrical position in the qubits space? The options are A through D, each with different coordinates.

Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of states) rather than a pure state. So this ρ is a 2x2 matrix, since it's dealing with qubits. Let me write it out to visualize better.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute that. Each term |n><n| is a projector matrix. So |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at position (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (2,2). Adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2 scales everything down.

So the matrix ρ would be:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, right. So it's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. That looks familiar. I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. 

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what that means. I think it's referring to the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point on a sphere where each axis corresponds to the computational basis states.

Wait, the Bloch sphere. A pure state |ψ> is represented as a point on the surface of the unit sphere, with the coordinates (x, y, z) corresponding to the angles in the state's representation. For example, |0> is at (0, 0, 1), and |1> is at (0, 0, -1). But for mixed states, the density matrix isn't a pure state, so it doesn't lie on the surface but inside the sphere.

I remember that the density matrix for a mixed state can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere, with the distance from the origin equal to the purity. The purity is Tr(ρ²), which for a maximally mixed state like this would be Tr(ρ²) = (1/2)^2 * 2 = 1/2. So the purity is 0.5, meaning the state is as mixed as possible for a qubit.

But wait, how do I find the coordinates (r) in the Bloch sphere? The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space with |r| ≤ 1. So let's expand this.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

Given our ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

So let's compute (I + r·σ)/2.

I is the identity matrix, so I/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0,1/2]].

r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. Let's compute each term:

r_x σ_x = [[0, r_x],[r_x, 0]]
r_y σ_y = [[0, -i r_y],[i r_y, 0]]
r_z σ_z = [[r_z, 0],[0, -r_z]]

Adding them together:

r·σ = [[r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, -r_z]]

So (I + r·σ)/2 would be:

[ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
  [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

But our given ρ is diagonal with (1/2, 1/2) on the diagonal and 0 off-diagonal. So for the off-diagonal terms to be zero, the terms (r_x - i r_y)/2 must be zero. Which implies that r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because (r_x - i r_y) = 0 would require both r_x and r_y to be zero.

So if r_x and r_y are zero, then the diagonal terms are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. But our ρ has both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. That would mean that (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2.

Let me solve for r_z. From the first equation: (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0. Similarly, the second equation gives the same result. So r_z is zero.

So the vector r is (0, 0, 0). That's the origin.

Wait, but wait. That's the maximally mixed state. Because when r is zero, the density matrix becomes I/2, which is the completely mixed state. So the geometrical position is at the origin. So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0).

Alternatively, I can think about the Bloch sphere representation. Since the state is completely mixed, it's in the center of the sphere. So the point is at (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which is the completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) such that \( |\mathbf{r}| \leq 1 \). For a density matrix \( \rho \), this is related to the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Expanding this, we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), the off-diagonal terms \( r_x - i r_y \) must be zero, which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). The diagonal terms \( (1 + r_z)/2 \) and \( (1 - r_z)/2 \) must both equal \( 1/2 \), which gives \( r_z = 0 \). Thus, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the geometrical position of the maximally mixed state. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
