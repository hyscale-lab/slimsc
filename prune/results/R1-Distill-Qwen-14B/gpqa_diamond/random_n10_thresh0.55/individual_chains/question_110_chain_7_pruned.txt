Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember from the question that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, magnitude is a bit tricky because lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars with V <17.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So same logic: apparent V magnitude less than 16. So HIRES can see brighter stars than ESPRESSO, since 16 is less than 17. Wait, wait no, no. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Because if a star's V is 16, it's brighter than 17, so HIRES can see it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so a star with V=17 can't be seen by HIRES but can be seen by ESPRESSO. So for a star to be seen by both, its V must be less than 17. But wait, no. Because HIRES can only go up to 16. So the star must have V <16 mag to be seen by both, because if it's between 16 and 17, HIRES can't see it but ESPRESSO can. So for both, the star's V must be less than 16.

Wait, but wait, I need to double-check. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, apparent V <17. Similarly, with HIRES, apparent V <16. So the stars must have V <16 to be visible to both. Because if it's V=16, HIRES can see it but ESPRESSO can't. Wait no, wait: ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, so V=16 is acceptable for both. Because 16 is less than 17, so both can see it. So the condition is that the star's apparent V magnitude must be less
