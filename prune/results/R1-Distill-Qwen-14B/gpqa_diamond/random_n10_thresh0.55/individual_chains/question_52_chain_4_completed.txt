Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how its temperature affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and how temperature affects the distribution of atoms between energy levels.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature.

Wait, but the spots themselves are cooler regions, right? Like, sunspots are darker and cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when a significant portion is covered, the average temperature drops. Got it.

The key part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) when the star has vs. doesn't have spots. The ratio decreases when there are spots. So, when the spots are present, the ratio is lower than when they're not. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. That is, (Ratio without spots) / (Ratio with spots) = factor.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's in the ultraviolet range, but not sure if that's relevant here. Oh wait, maybe it's about the ionization or excitation potential. Because different wavelengths correspond to different energies. But wait, the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the wavelength. Since E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength.

But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate that. The question is about the ratio of populations in two energy levels, which is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels, E1 and E2 are their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength. So the energy difference between the two levels is E = hc/λ. Let me compute that. The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-6 m). Let me calculate that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divide by 1.448e-6 m gives approximately 1.372e-19 J per photon. To convert that into eV (since sometimes it's easier to think in eV for atomic transitions), since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 1.372e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 0.856 eV. So the energy difference is about 0.856 eV. But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary here, but maybe I should note it down.

So, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ). Since E1 and E2 are the energies of levels 1 and 2, and if level 2 is higher than level 1, then E1 - E2 would be negative. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The energy levels: if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of energy E, then E2 > E1. So E1 - E2 is negative. So the exponent is positive because it's negative (E2 - E1) over kT.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact formula. The ratio n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) ). So if E_i > E_j, then the exponent is negative, so the ratio is less than 1 if the ratio of g's is 1.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature drops, which would affect the ratio.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of level 1 to level 2, right? Let me check: the ratio of the number of neutral Ti in level 1 and level 2.

So the ratio is n1/n2. Using the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k*T) )

But E1 is lower than E2, so E1 - E2 is negative. Therefore, the exponent is negative, which makes the ratio less than (g1/g2). So if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio increase.

Wait, let me think. Suppose T increases. The term (E1 - E2)/(k T) is a negative number over a larger denominator. So the exponent is a smaller negative number. For example, if E difference is -0.856 eV, and k*T is calculated in eV.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Boltzmann factor. The ratio n1/n2 = [g1/g2] * exp( (E1-E2)/(kT) )

Let me compute the exponent term. Let me express (E1 - E2) as -ΔE, where ΔE is positive (because E2 > E1). So the exponent is -ΔE/(k T). So the ratio becomes [g1/g2] * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases.

So, when the star has a higher temperature (no spots), the ratio n1/n2 is higher. When the star is cooler (has spots), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which aligns with the problem statement: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when the spots are present, the temperature is lower, so the ratio is lower.

We are to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Since (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so the ratio between the two cases is:

Factor = [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T_yes)) ] 

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_yes) ] )

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no) ] )

So, the factor is exp( [ΔE/(k)] [ 1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, wait, let me double-check that: when T increases, the exponent is less negative, so the ratio increases. So when T_yes (temperature with spots) is lower than T_no, then 1/T_yes is higher than 1/T_no. So [1/T_yes - 1/T_no] is positive, so the exponent is positive, so the factor is exp( positive ), which is greater than 1. Which makes sense because the ratio without spots is higher than with, so the factor is how much higher it is.

Now, I need to compute this factor.

So, first, let's compute ΔE. Wait, earlier I found that the energy difference is about 0.856 eV. But wait, that's the energy per photon. Let me make sure: the transition energy is E = hc/λ.

Wait, the transition wavelength is 1448 Å, so λ = 1448 × 10^-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. Wait, no, 1 Å is 1e-10 m, so 1448 Å is 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So, E = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So, E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 is approximately 8.56. So ΔE is about 8.56 eV?

Wait, that seems really high. Wait, wait, 8.56 eV is a lot for a transition in neutral Ti. Because neutral Titanium has an atomic number around 22, so the ionization energy is about 7.1 eV, but maybe the excitation energy is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

Compute E = hc / λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J = (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Hmm, that seems high. But perhaps it's correct. Maybe the transition is in the deep UV, so high energy.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the energy difference ΔE is 8.56 eV.

But wait, when the star has spots and the temperature is lower, does that affect the ratio? Let me think again.

The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So let's compute this for T = 6000 K and T =5500 K.

But wait, k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So for T_no = 6000 K:

ΔE/(k T_no) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) 

Let me compute denominator first: 8.617e-5 * 6000 = 0.517 eV.

So 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.54.

Similarly, for T_yes =5500 K:

ΔE/(k T_yes) =8.56 / (8.617e-5 *5500) → denominator is 8.617e-5 *5500 = 0.4739 eV.

So 8.56 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.07.

So, the exponent in the factor is [ (1/5500 - 1/6000 ) * (8.56/(8.617e-5)) ) ]

Wait, no, the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, let me make sure. The factor equation was:

Factor = exp( [ΔE/(k)] [ 1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, no, earlier I had:

Factor = exp( [ΔE/(k)] [ 1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, no, the earlier derivation was:

Factor = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no)) )

Wait, because [1/(T_yes) - 1/(T_no)] is 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(3.3e7) ) ≈ 0.00001515 K^-1.

So, the term inside the exponent is (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (0.00001515 ) 

Wait, let me compute that.

First, 8.56 eV divided by (8.617e-5 eV/K) is 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 99307 K.

So, 99307 K multiplied by 0.00001515 K^-1 is approximately 1.504.

So, the exponent is about 1.504.

So, Factor = exp(1.504) ≈ e^1.504 ≈ 4.49.

Wait, because e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is approx 4.4817.

So, the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations, because earlier I thought the energy difference was about 0.856 eV, but wait that was when I computed E = hc/lambda, but wait, wait a second: the transition energy is E = hc/lambda. So for a wavelength of 1448 Å, E is about 8.56 eV. But wait, is that possible for a neutral Titanium transition?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me recheck the calculation:

λ = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10^-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Hmm, that's correct. So the energy difference is about 8.56 eV, which is quite high. But for an ionization energy, that would make sense, but for an excitation, it's high. Well, perhaps it's a transition that requires a higher energy. Maybe it's a transition from a lower level to a higher level, but perhaps I should proceed with the numbers.

So the factor is about 4.5, which matches option C.

Wait, but another thought: wait, the ratio is (n1/n2) without spots over (n1/n2) with spots. 

So, when the star is hotter (no spots), n1/n2 is higher. So the ratio of (n1/n2)_no / (n1/n2)_with is higher than 1. So the factor is about 4.5.

So the correct answer is option C, ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) using the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are their energies, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The energy difference \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), which is calculated using:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
The wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Using \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), the energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Boltzmann Factor and Temperature Dependence
The ratio of populations depends on the Boltzmann factor:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right).
\]

The factor by which the ratio changes when the star transitions from \(T_{\text{no}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) to \(T_{\text{yes}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\) is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{yes}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Factor
Using \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\), calculate:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99307 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, compute the temperature term:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{yes}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} \approx 0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Now, calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{yes}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no}}}\right) \approx 99307 \times 0.00001515 \approx 1.504.
\]

Finally, compute the factor:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.504) \approx 4.49.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This matches option **C**.
