Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me read the question carefully. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's go through each of these one by one and see what they tell us.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches. So maybe this compound has an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid, or maybe something like an ether or ester, but the broadness suggests a strong hydrogen bonding, which is typical for -OH groups. So either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, I remember that carboxylic acids have very broad and strong O-H stretches, usually around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, sometimes even broader. Alcohols also show a broad peak in that area, but maybe less broad than carboxylic acids.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. Wait, if the compound has two carbonyl groups, that could explain two peaks. Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl and another functional group. Wait, but 1700 is a typical carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. Then 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like C=C stretching in an aromatic ring, or perhaps an amide or something else. But wait, if there's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would lower the carbonyl stretch frequency. For example, in an enone system, the carbonyl is around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (the C=C) might absorb around 1650.

So maybe the compound has a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond. Alternatively, 1650 could be an ester or something else. Wait,
