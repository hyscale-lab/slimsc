Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ. The matrix is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, so for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

First, let me write down the matrix of S. S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So, Ay is c multiplied by S. So c is h/(4π). Let me compute the matrix Ay:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix elements are:
[0*(h/(4π))   (-i)(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Wait, so that's:
[0, -i h/(4π) ]
[i h/(4π), 0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (Ay - λ I) and set it to zero.

So, the matrix (Ay - λ I) is:
[ -λ       -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)  -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ^2 - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h^2/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes:

λ^2 - [ (1) * h²/(16 π²) ) ] = 0

So, λ² = h²/(16 π²)
