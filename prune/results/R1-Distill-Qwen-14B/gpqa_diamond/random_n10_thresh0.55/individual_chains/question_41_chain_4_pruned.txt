Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the medium's rest frame, right? What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh right, this sounds like a problem involving the addition of velocities, maybe the relativistic Doppler effect or something from special relativity. Because if the medium is moving, the observer's frame is different.

Wait, but wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? Or is that only in vacuum? No, in a medium, the speed isn't c. But when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In the glass's rest frame, the light speed is c/n. Now the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So the observer in the lab sees the glass moving towards them, same direction as the light beam. So the speed of light in the moving glass would be... Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider the velocity addition formula from relativity. Normally, the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²
