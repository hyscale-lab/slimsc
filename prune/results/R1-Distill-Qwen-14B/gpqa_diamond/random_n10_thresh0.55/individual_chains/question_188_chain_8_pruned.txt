Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D with various Angstrom values.

Hmm, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos(alpha) - 2mn cos(beta) - 2nl cos(gamma) ) ), but wait, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing up some terms. Let me think.

Wait, no, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of squares in the Miller indices, but considering the angles between the lattice vectors. The formula I'm trying to recall is from the Bragg's law context, where d is the interplanar spacing.

Wait, for a general crystal with unit vectors a, b, c, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) ) when it's a cubic system, but in non-cubic systems, the formula becomes more complicated. Oh right, the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos(alpha) - 2kl cos(beta) - 2 lh cos(gamma) )

Wait, wait, not quite. Let me think again. I've read that for a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by a, a, a with angles between each pair of vectors equal (all alphas are same, so alpha=beta=gamma=θ, say). So in this case, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk (cos α) - hk (cos α) - hk (cos α) )

Wait, because for a rhombohedral lattice, the structure is such that a = b = c, and angles between each pair are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees here.

So the general formula for d is:
