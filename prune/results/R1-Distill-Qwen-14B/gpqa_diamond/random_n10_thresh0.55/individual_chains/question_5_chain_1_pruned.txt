Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the operator along direction n (which is in the x-z plane) would be P·n, which is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. But wait, the question says it's along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So that means n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n can be written as (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² =1. But since it's in x-z, the y-component is zero.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of P along n. So I think I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P·n, which is nx P_x + nz P_z (since Py would have a direction component, but n has zero in y, so Py doesn't contribute).

Wait, but the problem says the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So our operator is P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Let me write down each component.

P_x is given as (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Wait, because if I have a vector with components (nx, nz), then P·n would be nx P_x + nz P_z, right? Because the y-component of n is zero, so Py doesn't contribute.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

Wait, let me compute that. Let me compute the matrix elements:

The (
