Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use special relativity, right? So Newtonian mechanics won't work here because at high velocities, the effects of relativity become significant.

The problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the second is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous on the relative speed. Do I calculate the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame? Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. So I think I'll need to use the velocity addition formula for that part.

Let me recall the formula for adding velocities in relativity. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²), right? So if one object is moving at u in the lab frame and another at v, then from the first object's frame, the second is moving at (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)).

Wait, but wait. Which way are they moving? Both are moving in the positive x-direction. So, from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c (let's call him A), the other astronaut (B) is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. But wait, no, because from A's frame, B is moving slower. Wait, no, wait. Let's think.

Wait, no. If both are moving in the same direction, then the relative speed would be the difference of their velocities, but adjusted for relativity. Because in Newtonian physics, if B is at 0.5c and A is at 0.6c, then B is moving at (0.6 - 0.5)=0.1c relative to A. But relativity doesn't work that way. So I need to apply the velocity addition formula correctly.

Wait, wait. How does the velocity addition formula apply here? Let me think. Suppose in the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c. So to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, we use the formula (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, because in the lab frame, B is moving at 0.5c, but A is moving at 0.6c. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Let me plug in the numbers.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/(c²)) = (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/c²). Wait, simplifying the denominator: 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the numerator is (-0.1c)/0.7 = - (1/7)c ≈ -0.
