Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Then I need to figure out what the product is from the given options. The data provided includes IR and NMR spectra.

First, I'll start by analyzing the spectral data to determine the structure of compound X. Let's look at the IR and NMR data.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But the 3400 is broad, maybe an O-H. Wait, but 2500 is a bit lower; that could be C-H stretch maybe for alkenes or something else. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So, compound X has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which could be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. The integration is 1H, so maybe a phenolic OH, but wait, phenol O-H is usually around 5 ppm unless it's part of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but that's a singlet too. But the broadness suggests a carboxylic acid because the O-H in carboxylic acids are usually broad. So maybe X has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but wait, let me check. The other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets each integrating 2H suggest two substituents in the para positions. For example, a para-disubstituted benzene, like with two substituents opposite each other.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). Let's
