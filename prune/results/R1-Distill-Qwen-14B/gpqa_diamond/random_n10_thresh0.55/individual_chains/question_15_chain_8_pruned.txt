Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. We know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, that means Planet_1 is much closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, as per Kepler's laws.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit, right? So if Planet_1's period is three times shorter, then its semi-major axis (distance from the star) is smaller. Specifically, since P1 squared is to P2 squared as (a1/a2)^3. Let me calculate that. P1 = (1/3) P2. So (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3. So (1/9) = (a1/a2)^3 → a1 = a2 * (1/9)^(1/3) → which is a2 * (1/2.08) → approximately a2 * 0.48. So Planet_1 is about half the distance of Planet_2 from its star.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radii. Hmm, that's interesting. So even though the host star of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius, Planet_1's star is more massive, same size. Wait, does that mean anything about their densities or other properties? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

The question is about transit probability. The transit method detects a planet when it passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is closer to edge-on. But how does that relate to the other factors here?

Wait, the transit probability (the chance that the planet transits) is given by the formula: P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but
