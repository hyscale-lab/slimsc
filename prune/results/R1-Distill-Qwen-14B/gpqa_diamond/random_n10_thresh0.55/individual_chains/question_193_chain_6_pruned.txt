Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Then, it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds, and it's inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance r is 1 / plx. That makes sense. So if I can express the number of stars in terms of r, I can find the relationship.

The given relation is that the number of stars N varies as 1 / plx^5. So N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, plx = 1/r. So 1/plx would be r, right? So replacing plx with 1/r, the equation becomes N ∝ 1 / ( (1/r) )^5.

Wait, let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So when r increases, does N increase as r^5? So, if the distance increases by a small amount, how does the number of stars per unit distance change?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The number of stars in a region is given by N ∝ r^something. But the question is about the change per unit range, which is like the gradient or the derivative. So maybe I need to find dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the change in number of stars with distance is proportional to r^4. But looking at the options, option C is r^4. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the initial relation is N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N ∝ r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. Now, to find
