Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, so the setup is that two stars with the same mass (like the Sun) each have a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble.

The problem gives the periodic shift of a spectral line for each planet: Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so I need to find the ratio P2/P1. Right. The RV method's signal depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period, I think. Oh, right— the RV signal (which is the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift) is given by a certain formula. Let me recall that formula.

I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) ] * ( sin(i) ) / ( ( (P * (1 day in seconds) )^(1/3) ) * (2π)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the semi-major axis. Or perhaps another approach: since both stars have the same mass and the periods are what we're looking for, maybe it's better to relate the velocities.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet. So for a circular orbit, the maximum velocity (K) of the star is given by:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

Since both M_* are the same (solar masses) and M_p are similar to Neptune (which is much less than the star's mass), we can approximate M_* + M_p
