Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ligands, right? So, the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+. But wait, I'm not exactly sure what each β represents. Oh, right, the stability constant βn is for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, etc.

So, the problem is about the distribution of Co species in solution. The total Co is all the possible complexes, each with different numbers of SCN- attached. But how do I calculate the percentage of each species?

I remember that the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, then sum them up, and find the percentage for the desired one.

Each complex can be represented as CoSCN^n- where n is 0 (free Co^2+), 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait no, the complexes are Co with varying numbers of SCN- ligands. So, the possible complexes are Co^2+, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4.

The stability constants tell us how much each complex forms. The higher β, the more stable the complex. So, the Co(SCN)3 would be more stable than Co(SCN)2 if β3 is higher than β2. Wait, looking at the βs: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So, β3 is the highest, followed by β2, then β4, and β1 is lower than β2 and β3.

So, the most stable complex is Co(SCN)3 with β=6
