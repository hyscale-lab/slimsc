Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The question is a multiple-choice one, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's parse the problem. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum components are often represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by some constants. The Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 particles, which muons are, I think. The S matrix here looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix, which is usually written as σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. But wait, the standard Pauli matrices are multiplied by ħ/2 to get the spin matrices. Oh, wait, maybe I should think about the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices. I remember that the eigenvalues of σy are ±i. So let me write that down.

The matrix S is σy, so S has eigenvalues i and -i. Then, Ay is c times S, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by those. So c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a would be c*i and c*(-i), which are i*(h/(4π)) and -i*(h/(4π)).

Wait, wait, but the question is about the eigenvalues of Ay. So, a = c * (i) and a = c * (-i). So a is (h/(4π)) * i and -(h/(4π)) * i.

Looking at the options, let's see what each says.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't match because the eigenvalues I computed are purely imaginary. So their real parts are zero. So option A is talking about real and imaginary parts both non-zero, which doesn't fit. So probably not A.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, that doesn't make sense either. Because the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so real parts would be zero. So B is talking about both parts, which seems incorrect. Also, the numerical values don't match what I found. My a is (h/(4π)) multiplied by ±i, so the magnitude is h/(4π). So the imaginary parts would be ±h/(4π), not ±1/2 as in option B. So I think B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. I remember that the square of the angular momentum operator, A², commutes with all components of A, so eigenfunctions of any component of A are eigenfunctions of A². So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part of C is correct. But what about Az? Well, Ay and Az don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So a function that's an eigenfunction of Ay won't be an eigenfunction of Az. So the statement in C says that the eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. That sounds correct. So C might be the correct answer.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not entirely sure what this means. The basis functions usually refer to the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) of the operator. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenfunctions which form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator Ay. So D's statement seems correct as well.

Wait, but let me think again. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so
