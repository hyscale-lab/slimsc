Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by a certain Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is written as L = -λf ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I should parse this correctly. Oh right, the structure probably includes a term like λ times ψ_f-bar ψ_f times (something with X). Maybe it's something like a Yukawa coupling term because Yukawa interactions involve terms where a boson couples two fermions.

So, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. That means we're looking for decay channels where X can decay into a pair of particles (like fermions) such that the energy is enough for their masses.

Wait, fermions come in pairs, right? Like for a decay X → f f-bar, each fermion has a certain mass. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so the sum of the masses of the fermion and anti-fermion must be less than or equal to 6 GeV for the decay to be possible.

But wait, in reality, for a decay like X → f f-bar, the threshold is when the mass of X is at least 2m_f, because each fermion has mass m_f. So the rest mass of X
