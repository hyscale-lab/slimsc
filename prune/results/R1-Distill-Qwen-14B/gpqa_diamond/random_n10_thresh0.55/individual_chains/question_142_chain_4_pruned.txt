Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. So the question is about the density matrix ρ given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the question is asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different r values.

Wait, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, right? They're Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have a trace of 1. But I'm a bit confused about how to represent them geometrically. Oh, right, for qubits, the state can be visualized in a 2D space, often using the Bloch sphere. But wait, this is a density matrix, not a pure state. How does that change things?

So, the density matrix ρ is given as 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in matrix form to get a clearer picture. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], but multiplied by 1/2, so ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So it's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Wait, in the Bloch sphere representation, a pure state is a vector on the surface. But what about a mixed state? I
