Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm.

Alright, let's read the question again. There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”just the electrostatic potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. So they're all sitting on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So point P is where one charge is, and the other 12 are on the sphere 2 meters away.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, I think I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy between all pairs of charges. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so maybe the energy comes from the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, plus the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the minimum energy... Oh, wait, no, in electrostatics, the potential energy is fixed once the charges are placed because they can't move without violating the constraints. So I guess I just calculate the potential energy of the system as it's set up.

So the system has two parts: the energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12,
