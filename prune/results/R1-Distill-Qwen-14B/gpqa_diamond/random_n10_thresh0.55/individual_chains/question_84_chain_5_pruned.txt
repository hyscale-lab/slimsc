Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about the key factor that allows converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when using matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional methods. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that in solving partial differential equations numerically, especially with methods like finite differences, the approach often involves discretizing the equations into a system of linear equations. For heat equations, this usually leads to a system that can be represented as something like u' = Au, where A is a matrix derived from the finite difference stencil.

In sequential algorithms, you'd typically solve this using methods like backward Euler or other time-stepping schemes, which might involve computing the matrix exponential exp(AΔt) at each time step. But for parallel computing, you want to break down the problem so that different parts can be computed simultaneously.

Parallel splitting methods, I think, involve decomposing the matrix A into several submatrices. Each part can then be exponentiated separately, and these exponentials are combined somehow. So the idea is to split the problem into smaller, more manageable parts that can be processed in parallel.

Now, the question is about the key factor in converting the algorithm. One approach I remember is the use of the "parallelization across the time steps." Wait, no. Another thing is the approximation of the matrix exponential. Fractional approximation methods, like those using Padé approximants or other rational function approximations, might be involved here.

I think the matrix exponential exp(AΔt) can be approximated by a rational function, perhaps something like (I + aΔt)^alpha or similar. But when you have a higher-order approximation, the structure of the approximation matters for parallel computation.

Wait, the question mentions a "fractional approximation." Fractional in the sense of fractional calculus, or just a fraction-based approximation? Maybe it's talking about approximating the exponential with a fractional-order function, but I'm not sure.

So, the key factor for converting the algorithm from sequential to parallel is probably related to how the matrix is split or how the approximation breaks down into parts that can be handled in parallel.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, which is important, but not directly about parallelism.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal BCs complicate things, but how do they relate to parallel algorithms? Not sure.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Hmm, complex roots could affect the behavior of the approximation. If the approximation's denominator has complex roots, it might need to be handled differently, perhaps leading to more efficient parallel computations.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions decompose a rational function into simpler terms. If the approximation can be expressed as a sum of simpler fractions, each part could be exponentiated independently, allowing for parallel computation.

So, linear partial fractions would split the approximation into a sum of terms that can be handled separately. That sounds like it would enable parallel processing because each term could be computed in parallel.

Wait, for instance, if the approximation is a sum of terms like (I + a_i Δt)^-1, each of those could be computed in parallel, right?
