Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts, labeled A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the major products. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one among A, B, C, or D.

Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile adds to the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. The reaction is important because it's a way to form carbon-carbon bonds, which is a big deal in organic synthesis.

Now, looking at part (A): dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). NaOEt is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating the malonate to form an enolate. Malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate, I think. The acceptor here is the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl group is on the beta carbon. So the structure is more like CH2-CO-OCH3 attached to the benzene ring? Or wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Oh, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH2CH3 if it's methyl. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH- with the substituent on the second carbon. Hmm, no, wait, the formula given is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw this out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe it's (E)-CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH
