Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in different energy bands. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. And we're supposed to find the ratio of flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux band1 over band2.

Wait, first, I think I need to recall what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, right? The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch must be one of the steps in the proton-proton cycle. I remember that the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a helium-3 nucleus (a triton?) into helium-4, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the pp chain starts with two protons fusing into a deuteron, then captures another proton to become helium-3. Then, in the pp-II branch, a helium-3 captures a proton to become carbon-12, which then fuses with another helium-3 to make nitrogen-14, which can then either go through the pp-III branch or the CNO cycle. So the pp-III branch would involve the nitrogen-14 capturing a proton to become oxygen-15, which then emits a positron and becomes nitrogen-14 again... or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, the pp-III branch is the part where two helium-3 nuclei combine into helium-4, which is a significant part of the proton-proton chain.

But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch has stopped. So if the pp-III branch is a step that produces neutrinos, stopping it would mean we no longer get those neutrinos. And since it's the Sun's core, the neutrinos take about 8.5 minutes to reach Earth, so the question is about the current flux as observed here.

I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a lot of the high-energy neutrinos, maybe the ones around 800-900 keV. Oh wait, no, I remember solar neutrinos come from different processes. The main one is the pp chain, which produces electron neutrinos. Oh, and the primary neutrinos are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the step
