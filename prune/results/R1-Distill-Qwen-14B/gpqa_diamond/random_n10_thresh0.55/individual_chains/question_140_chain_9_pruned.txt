Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see if I can break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms.

Hmm, let's start by parsing each part.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, X must be a compound where one element has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. Maybe something like chlorine, which has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. But I'm not sure yet.

The reaction is violent, and it releases gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. So, W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, wait—each molecule? Or each atom? Because the gas is a molecule, perhaps each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps each atom in the molecule has that property.

Wait, no, the molecule's total. Wait, no—that's probably not. Let me think: for a molecule, the total number of protons and neutrons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Because if it's the molecule as a whole, that's a bit more complicated. Let's think about possible gases.

What gases are released in violent reactions? Maybe H2, O2, CO2, NH3, something like that. But the gas's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, maybe CO2? Let's see: CO2 is carbon (6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's C-12), and two oxygens (8 protons each, 8 neutrons if O-16). Wait, but wait: the molecule as a whole—the sum of protons and sum of neutrons would have to be equal.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is H2O. Let's see: each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's H-1), and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So in H2O, total protons: 2 +8=10. Total neut
