Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to pick the right reagent (A) and catalyst (B) from the options provided.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what kind of reaction this is. Acid-catalyzed reactions in amines... Oh, right, when amines react with carbonyl compounds under acidic conditions, it's typically a type of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but wait—another possibility is the formation of imines or enamines. Enamines are usually formed from amines and ketones or aldehydes, right?

Wait, let's think about the product structure. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the cyclohexylidene group is attached to the pyrrolidine. Cyclohexylidene implies a cyclohexene ring, like a substituted cyclohexene. So, the structure would have a double bond, perhaps, between the cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine.

Wait, the substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Oh, right, so it's a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. So, the pyrrolidine is connected via CH2– to the cyclohexene ring.

So, starting
