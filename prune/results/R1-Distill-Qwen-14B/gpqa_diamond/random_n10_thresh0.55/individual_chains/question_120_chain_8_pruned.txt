Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (p) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax, so d = 1/p. So, if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? I suppose it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's denote that as n_0.

I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like a bin in parallax) changes with p. So, if I consider a small change in parallax, say from p to p + dp, how many stars are there in that range?

Wait, but how does distance relate to parallax? Since d = 1/p, as p increases, d decreases. So, small parallax means distant stars, and large parallax means closer stars.

Let's think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars N in that shell is N = n_0 * 4π d² dd.

But since we're dealing with parallax, which is p = 1/d, let's express d in terms of p. So, d = 1/p. Then, dd would be the derivative of d with respect to p. Let's see: d = (1/p), so dd = (-1/p²) dp. Hmm, but in terms of dp, the change in p is positive if d is decreasing, so maybe I should take absolute values. So, |dd| = (1/p²) dp.

Wait, but when p increases by dp, d decreases by (1/p²) dp. So, the shell's volume in terms of p would be N = n_0 * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, because d squared is (1/p)^2, and dd is (1/p²) dp. So, N = n_0 * 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p²) dp = n_0 *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So, the number of stars per unit change in parallax (dp) is proportional to (1/p^4). But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if we look at a small interval of parallax dp, the number of stars is N = n_0 *4π (1/p^4) dp. So, per unit parallax (dp), it's proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are given in terms of how the number changes with plx. So, the number per unit plx (like per 1 unit of plx) would scale as
