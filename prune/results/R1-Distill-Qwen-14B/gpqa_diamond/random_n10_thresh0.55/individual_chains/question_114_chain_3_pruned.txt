Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read the question carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. But wait, in the presence of an acid or a base? Oh right, I think for the addition of HCN to ketones, we usually use an acid catalyst. So maybe the first step uses H3O+ as reagent A. Because the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the carbonyl group. Wait, though, the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) would add HCN. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, and when it reacts with HCN, it would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN, right? Which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that makes sense. So for that, the reaction would be under acidic conditions. So A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile plus B (H2O) gives the corresponding acid. Wait, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So that's a hydrolysis reaction. Nitriles hydrolyze under certain conditions. But wait, in the presence of water and an acid or base?

Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed in acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, you get a carboxylic acid, and in basic, you get a carboxylate. But the product here is a carboxylic acid, so maybe the reaction is done in acidic conditions.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O. So perhaps the reaction is using H2O as the solvent, but what catalyst? Because just water might not be enough. Maybe an
