Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and figure out what's going on.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, and their temperature is 1000K less than the star's. The setup is that when we observe the star's brightness over time, it varies as the star rotates, which is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would cause a dip in brightness. But the question is, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation as these spots do?

So, we need to compare the two scenarios: the brightness changes due to the spots and due to an exoplanet transit. The problem says that if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

First, let me think about how each scenario affects the light curve.

For the spots: when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into and out of view. Since the spots are cooler, when they are on the visible side, the star's overall brightness decreases. So the star's light curve would dip periodically as the spots rotate into and out of our line of sight.

For the exoplanet: when the planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star.

The key here is that the amplitude of the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) should be the same in both cases. So I need to calculate the amplitude caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

But wait, the problem states that the star is covered in dark spots, but the question is about what exoplanet would produce the same amplitude. So I have to model both situations and set their amplitudes equal.

Let me structure this step by step.

First, calculate the brightness variation due to the star spots.

The star has a radius Rstar equal to the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover a certain fraction of the hemisphere. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, but a hemisphere is a spherical cap, so the area is 2πR², because a sphere's surface area is 4πR² and a hemisphere is half. But wait, if the star is a sphere, then the area of the hemisphere is 2πR².

Wait, but the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR²? Hmm, or is it 0.2 of the entire star's surface? Because if only one hemisphere is spotty, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So that hemisphere (which is half the star's surface area) has 20% of its area covered by spots. So for the hemisphere, the spot area is 0.2 × (2π R²) =
