Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that's absorbed, which causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for a rotational-vibrational model would be the ground state of both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So, this model considers both the vibrational and rotational energies, right? But wait, the non-rigid rotor (or rigid rotor?) might have different energy levels. Wait no, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid (maybe vibration included?) would have a varying bond length. Hmm, I'm a bit confused there. But maybe for this problem, the key points are about the energy transitions.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

The options are all momenta in N*s, so I need to find which photon's momentum would cause the transition.

Wait, when a photon is absorbed, its energy is absorbed, causing the molecule to transition. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the initial and final
