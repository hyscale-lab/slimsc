Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The elements Aij are hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are 0 and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Hmm, that must be a spin-x operator or something similar. Because spin matrices usually have off-diagonal terms.

Wait, the spin matrices: the Pauli matrices. For example, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and when scaled, it's similar. So the operator here might be (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli X has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So A would be (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

The first part is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator. But wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are different from the standard |up> and |down> which are eigenstates of σ_z. So, to find the probabilities, I probably need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize matrix A and find its eigenvectors, then express |alpha> in that basis to find the probabilities.

Wait, the operator A is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

So, it's a symmetric matrix, which means it's diagonalizable with orthogonal eigenvectors.

The eigenstates of this operator can be found by solving the characteristic equation. Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The trace is zero, and the determinant is -(ħ^2/4). The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - (
