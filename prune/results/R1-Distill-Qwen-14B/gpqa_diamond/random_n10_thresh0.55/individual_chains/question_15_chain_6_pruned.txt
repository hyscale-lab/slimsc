Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and how the orbits are aligned.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been found using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star since it has a shorter period. Kepler's third law says that the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, but maybe I don't need to get into that here.

Both planets have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit. The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting. So more massive stars can have the same radius? Wait, usually more massive stars are bigger, but maybe Planet_1's star is in a different stage or something. But the problem says they have the same radius, so that's a given.

We need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so which one is more likely to pass in front of its star from our perspective. The probability of transit depends on the size of the star and the distance of the planet's orbit. The formula I remember for the transit probability is (R_p / a)^2, but wait, no. Let me think. The geometric probability is roughly (R_s / a), where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet has to pass in front, so the chance depends on the ratio of the star's size to the distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a). Because the area where the planet can be in front is a circle around the star with radius a, and the area where transit can happen is the disk of the star. So the probability is (R_s / a) squared divided by something? Or maybe it's just the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, because the planet's
