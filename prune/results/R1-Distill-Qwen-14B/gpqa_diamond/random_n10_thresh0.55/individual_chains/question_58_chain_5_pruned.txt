Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question. It's about which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, right? Like when calculations give infinite results, you use regularization to make them finite, and then you renormalize. 

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics. Let me think about each one.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a well-known quantum field theory. I recall that QED has processes like electron-positron pair production and deals with photon interactions. Because it's a renormalizable theory, it doesn't have issues with non-predictive infinities. Wait, but doesn't QED require regularization when calculating loop diagrams? Like the one-loop corrections to the electron mass or charge? So yes, QED does need regularization, so option C is out because the question is about the theory that never requires it.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong force. It's also a quantum field theory, but it's non-abelian and has asymptotic freedom. I think QCD calculations can also have divergences, especially in loop diagrams. So you need regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice methods. So option B isn't the answer either.

Classical Electrodynamics (CED) is the Maxwell's theory, right? It's a classical field theory without quantum mechanics. Since it's classical, it doesn't have the same kinds of infinities that quantum theories have. For example, the classical electron doesn't have issues with renormalization because there's no concept of creating or annihilating particles. So in classical theories, you don't need regularization because they don't have the divergent integrals that quantum theories do. Therefore, D) Classical Electrodynamics might be the correct answer because it doesn't require regularization at high energies.

Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that unites gravity with quantum mechanics. Strings are supposed to avoid some of the divergences because they're one-dimensional objects. In string theory, higher-order terms (like loops) are finite because the theory's perturbative expansion doesn't produce the same divergences as in point particle theories. So Superstring Theory doesn't require regularization because the underlying structure (strings) inherently regularizes the theory. That's why option A) Superstring Theory could also be a candidate.

Wait, but the question is about which theory "never requires regularization at high energies." So I need to think about each theory's approach. In QED, you definitely need it. QCD also needs it. CED doesn't, because it's classical. But what about Superstring Theory? Since it's a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as QFT, it might not require regularization either. Hmm, but the options are asking which one never requires it. So between A and D.

Wait, the question says "at high energies". So in high energies, the classical theories may not hold. But wait, classical electrodynamics breaks down at high energies because you need quantum effects. But in that case, the theory itself isn't valid, so perhaps the question is considering when the theory is applicable. Alternatively, the question is about whether the theory, as formulated, requires regularization.

So, in string theory, perhaps the need for regularization is absent because the
