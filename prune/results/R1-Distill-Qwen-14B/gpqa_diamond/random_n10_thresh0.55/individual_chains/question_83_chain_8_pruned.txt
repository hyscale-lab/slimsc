Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm.

We are diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02000 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Oh wait, right, the dilution equation: M1V1 = M2V2.

So, initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M, volume is 20 cm³. Diluting with 20 cm³ of water. So the new volume is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? For a weak acid like acetic acid reacting with a strong base like NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me calculate the moles first. The diluted acetic acid has concentration 0.025 M, volume 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). Moles of acetic acid = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

So, for equivalence, moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the problem says the titration
