Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

So, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We have a diluted solution, and we're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, let me parse the problem. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 mL. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, what's the initial concentration after dilution? The initial moles of acetic acid are volume × concentration. So 20 mL is 0.02 L. Moles = 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 mL of water (which is 0.02 L) makes the total volume 40 mL (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, but when you dilute it, its concentration decreases. Right. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe
