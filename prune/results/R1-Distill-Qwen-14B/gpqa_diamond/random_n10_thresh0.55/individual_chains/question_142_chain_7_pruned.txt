Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The options are A, B, C, D with different r coordinates.

First, let me remember what a density matrix represents. A density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, it's a 2x2 matrix. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). 

Wait, I think |0> and |1> are the standard basis states. So, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1|. So adding them together, each would contribute a 1 at their respective diagonal positions. Then multiply by 1/2. 

So the matrix ρ would be [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. That's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 0.5. 

I remember that the density matrix for a qubit can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector has components (x,y,z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are X, Y, Z.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. Here, I is the identity matrix. So if I expand that, ρ would be (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 + (σ_x r_x + σ_y r_y + σ_z r_z)/2.

In our case, the given ρ is already (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which suggests that the other terms (the ones involving Pauli matrices) must be zero. Therefore, the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. 

Wait, let me think again. The identity matrix part is (I)/2, which is the same as (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So the rest of ρ comes from (r·σ)/2. So if the given ρ is exactly (I)/2, then that implies that the (r·σ)/2 part is zero. Which means r must be zero vector.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). 

Wait, let me double-check. The given ρ is a completely mixed state. Because for a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector, like |0><0| or |1><1|. But when you take the average of |0> and |1>, you get a mixed state. And a mixed state in the Bloch sphere is represented by the origin because it's completely mixed—no coherence and equal probabilities for both states. So yeah, that's the zero vector. 

So the geometrical position is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is
