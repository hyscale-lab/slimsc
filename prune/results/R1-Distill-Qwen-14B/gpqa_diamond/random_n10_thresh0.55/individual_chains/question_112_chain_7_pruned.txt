Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so that's the state vector. And |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Oh right, so those are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles.

The first part asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, okay. So A is a 2x2 matrix. Let's think about what that looks like.

For a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j run from 1 to 2. So when i != j, Aij is hbar/2. So the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, wait. Because when i=1 and j=2, it's hbar/2, and when i=2 and j=1, it's hbar/2. And the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. That matrix looks familiar. Oh, right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here each element is hbar/2 times that. So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

But maybe I should approach this without assuming that. Let me think about the eigenstates of this operator. The eigenstates would be the eigenvectors of the matrix A.

So, to find the eigenstates of A, I need to solve the equation A|v> = λ|v>.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1). So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. And the corresponding eigenvectors would be the same as those of sigma_x, which are the states |+x> and |-x>, the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this from scratch.

So the matrix is:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

The characteristic equation is det(A - λ I) = 0.

So:

| -λ    hbar/2       |
| hbar/2   -λ        |  = 0

The determinant is λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0 → λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I ) |v> = 0

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ -hbar/2 , hbar/2 ],
