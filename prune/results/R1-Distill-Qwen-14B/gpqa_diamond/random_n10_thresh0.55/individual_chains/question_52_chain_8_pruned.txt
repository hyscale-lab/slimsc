Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star. The star's parameters are given: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the difference in energy divided by thermal energy (k*T), where T is the temperature.

The formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant. 

In this problem, the transition between the energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Ã…. So that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-ultraviolet? But the exact wavelength might not be directly necessary unless it's about the energy difference.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. But we need to think about how the presence of spots affects the photosphere. Spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is lower. But how does this affect the photospheric conditions where the Ti atoms are?

Wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500K. So the star's average temperature is lower when spots are present. But are the spots themselves part of the photosphere? I think so. So the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler
