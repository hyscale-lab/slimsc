Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? I remember that the parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So if plx is small, the star is far away, and if plx is larger, it's closer. That makes sense because closer objects have a larger apparent shift in position when viewed from different points in our orbit around the Sun.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed probably means that the actual density of stars in space is constant—like, same number of stars per cubic parsec everywhere. But wait, how does that translate when we observe them from Earth?

So the key is to find how the number of stars per unit parallax interval (like per 0.1 parsecs of plx) changes with plx. Let's think in terms of volume and distances.

Parallax formula: plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx.

If we have a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx, what does that mean for the distances? The corresponding distance range would be from d =1/plx to d' = 1/(plx + dplx). Wait, no, that's not right. Because plx is small, and we're considering a small change dplx. Let me think in calculus terms. For a small change in plx, dplx, the change in distance dd is approximately dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dd/dplx = -1/plx². So a small increase in plx (dplx positive) leads to a decrease in d.

But how does the number of stars in a shell of radius d to d+dd relate to the parallax? Well, the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Because each shell's volume is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by thickness (dd). 

So the number of stars in that shell depends on the volume. If the density of stars is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, then the number of stars N in the shell is n * 4πd² dd.

But we want to
