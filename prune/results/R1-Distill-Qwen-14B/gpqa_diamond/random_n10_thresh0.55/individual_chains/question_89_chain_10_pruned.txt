Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me try to think through this carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically dehydrohalogenation, to form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So, the molecule has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons.

So heating with KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination, removing two equivalents of HBr and forming a double bond. But wait, in the product description, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's usually indicative of an -OH group or maybe an ether. Oh wait, but KOH is a base, so maybe it's forming an epoxide? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have a dihalide and you treat it with a base, you usually get an elimination, like forming an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But wait, if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, that might not be adjacent. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1 and 3 are across from each other? Or are they adjacent? Wait, no, in the structure of adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons. Because adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane structure, so any two adjacent carbons would be on the same face or opposite. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. It has a diamond-like structure, so each carbon is connected in a way that each has four bonds. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two non-adjacent carbons. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. So when heated with KOH, they undergo elimination, forming a double bond. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a
