Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully and think about each part.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, several products (1, 2, 3) are formed through different reactions. The task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, let me outline each step as described:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, yielding product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are given for product 1.

2. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide to give product 3.

The question is about the coupling pattern in the 1H NMR of product 3. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

I think I need to figure out what each product is and then determine the structure of product 3. Once I have that, I can analyze its NMR spectrum.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and dibrominated at 1,3 positions. KOH is a strong base, so likely an elimination reaction. Wait, but heating with KOH... dibromides often undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But given adamantane's structure, perhaps the reaction is elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, wait. Adamantane is a cage structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure. When treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in excess and heated, it probably undergoes dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene.

So, product 1 is likely 1,3-diamantadiene or something similar. The NMR data should help. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, possibly for an -OH group, but wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? No, wait, because if it's an elimination, perhaps it forms a ketone? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a diene, but the IR data suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, perhaps it undergoes a Hofmann elimination or similar. But that usually forms alkenes. Alternatively, considering that adamantane's structure is quite rigid, the elimination might form a bridge structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a bridgehead double bond. Because in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are those positions. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose HBr from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond between C1 and C3, making a diene.

But wait, the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests that product 1 isn't an alkene but something with a carbonyl group, like a ketone.

Hmm, so perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but rather substitution. But with KOH, substitution would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the bromide is replaced by hydroxide, but two substitutions would be unlikely unless it's a diol.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, but epoxide formation usually requires an acid catalyst, not KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol, but let me think again. The NMR of product 1 has a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a high chemical shift, which is typical of an alcohol or perhaps an ether. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction forms a ketone via oxidation? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is elimination to form a ketone. Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. For example, if the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond, but if the structure isn't a straight chain, maybe it leads to a ring being opened, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. KOH is often used in elimination reactions (like E2), but in some cases, for certain substrates, it can lead to the formation of epoxides or other oxygen-containing compounds.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH—could it be a case of forming an epoxide? Epoxides are formed from vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) using a base. So, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, which I think they are in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, then KOH could cause the formation of an epoxide. Because in the case of vicinal dihalides, treatment with a base like NaOH or KOH forms an epoxide via an SN2 mechanism.

So product 1 would be 1,3-epoxyadamantane. Let me check: an epoxide would have an oxygen ring. The IR would show a peak around 1250-1300 cm-1 for the epoxide. But wait, the IR here is at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Let me think about the structure. If two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in adamantane, and KOH removes both, perhaps replacing them with two O atoms as in a diol, but that would be a diol. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, where two HBr molecules are removed, forming a carbonyl group. For example, if two adjacent Brs are present, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen from each, leading to the formation of a double bond, but in a cage structure, that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of forming a ketone via the loss of two HBr molecules.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think about a geminal dihalide. If a compound has two halogens on the same carbon, elimination of HX could form a carbonyl. But in this case, the bromines are on adjacent carbons (1 and 3), so perhaps the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C3. But then that's an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, but then the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon treatment with KOH undergoes a substitution to form a diol. But the IR would then show O-H stretching, which is broad, but product 1's IR has a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction forms a ketone via a neighboring group effect. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step forms a diketone, but that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but the IR peak they're referring to is not the epoxide but something else. Wait, the IR at 1720 could be an ester or a ketone. If the product is an epoxide, maybe there's another functional group as well, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but a ketone. Let's imagine that the reaction forms a ketone. How? If the elimination forms a carbonyl group. But for that, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and upon two dehydrohalogenation steps, a carbonyl is formed.

Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a conjugated diene with some ring strain, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring, but that's another possibility.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows:

- 4.79 (2H, singlet)
- 2.41-2.23 (10H, probably a multiplet)
- 1.94 (2H, maybe a triplet or something else)

The singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H suggests two equivalent protons. What gives a singlet? Maybe an OCH2O group, like in an epoxide. Wait, no, because in an epoxide, the protons are adjacent to an oxygen and are usually in a triplet or something else due to coupling with neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group with adjacent protons, but that doesn't fit a singlet.

Wait, another thought: if the product is an epoxide, the protons on the carbons adjacent to the oxygen would typically couple with each other and possibly with the oxygen. But in a rigid structure like adamantane, maybe the coupling is restricted. Alternatively, maybe the two protons are equivalent and not split, so a singlet.

But the IR doesn't match because epoxides don't have a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's more like a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a diketone. Let me think: if KOH is a base, could it cause a cleavage of an adjacent dihalide to form two carbonyl groups? But with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps that would form a ketone in the center.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, so maybe elimination would form an alkene, not a ketone.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me consider alternative approaches. Maybe product 1 is an epoxide, but the IR peak doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via a different mechanism.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be an example of the formation of an epoxide, but the IR peak at 1720 is due to some other functional group, perhaps from impurities or another part of the molecule. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but something else entirely.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules to form a conjugated diene. Then, the IR would show C=C absorption around 1650 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, so that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cycloalkane, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, but how? Maybe the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Let's think: If two adjacent Br atoms are present, perhaps upon elimination, a carbonyl is formed. But that would require the Brs to be in a position that allows for such elimination. Wait, perhaps it's a case of pinacol-like elimination, but I'm not sure.

I'm not making much progress on product 1, so perhaps I should move to the next step and see if that gives any clues.

Product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a solid—maybe a ketone or an epoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of acylation or alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, then Al isopropoxide might catalyze the opening of the epoxide. Epoxide ring-opening can occur under acidic conditions, where the oxygen becomes protonated, making the ring more reactive. Al isopropoxide could act as a Lewis acid, coordinating to the oxygen and facilitating the attack of a nucleophile. But in this case, what would the nucleophile be? If it's just the product 1, perhaps it's an intramolecular reaction.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide isn't doing much. Hmm.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is helping in some kind of enolate formation or acylation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: If product 1 is a diol, then Al isopropoxide might facilitate the formation of a cyclic ether or some kind of acetal formation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the overall process. The first reaction produces product 1, which is then reacted with Al isopropoxide. Then, product 2 is ozonized to give product 3.

Ozonolysis of product 2 yields product 3. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond, as ozonolysis breaks that.

Wait, but earlier steps: if product 2 has a double bond, then product 1 must have been transformed into something with a double bond when treated with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene. Or maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it forms an alkene via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and Al isopropoxide is used in an elimination reaction to form a double bond.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, then treating it with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide might lead to the formation of an oxonium ion, facilitating elimination of water to form an alkene. That makes sense—so product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of an alkene would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be the result of breaking the double bond into two carbonyls.

But let me try to piece this together.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 with KOH.

If product 1 is a diol (1,3-diol), then the structure would have two -OH groups on adjacent carbons.

Step 2: Product 1 (diol) treated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide can act as a Lewis acid, perhaps facilitating the loss of water from the diol to form an alkene via elimination. So product 2 would be 1,3-diadamantylene (an alkene).

Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2 (alkene) to form product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves alkenes to form carbonyl compounds. So product 3 would be two carbonyl-containing compounds. But because adamantane is a rigid structure, perhaps the ozonolysis doesn't break the entire molecule but only the double bond, leading to two ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, but ozonolysis followed by workup (like with dimethyl sulfide) typically breaks the alkene into two carbonyl groups. So if product 2's structure is such that the double bond is between C1 and C3 of adamantane, ozonolysis would split the molecule, but I'm not sure exactly how because adamantane is a highly branched structure.

But perhaps the ozonolysis would break the double bond, leading to two ketone groups in product 3. Alternatively, maybe the molecule becomes two separate fragments.

Wait, but the problem says that product 3 is formed after ozonolysis and workup. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But wait, in the ozonolysis of a symmetric alkene, you get two identical carbonyl compounds. If the alkene is in the middle of a symmetric structure, the product would be two of the same compounds.

But let me think about the structure. If product 2 is 1,3-diamantadiene, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, leading to two ketone groups.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me go back to product 1. If product 1 is a diol, then its structure would be 1,3-diol adamantane.

The NMR of product 1: the singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) would correspond to the two -OH protons? No, because -OH protons usually appear as broad singlets, but in the data, it's a singlet but at 4.79, which is more like a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-O- group. Wait, but in an epoxide, the protons are adjacent to oxygen and typically deshielded, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is for two equivalent protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But then the IR should show an epoxide peak. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that product 1 is an epoxide. Then, the 1H NMR would have an epoxide's protons. But in a rigid structure like adamantane, the epoxide's protons might be equivalent, leading to a singlet. But that's not typical for epoxides, which usually have protons that are split due to coupling.

Wait, but the chemical shift for the singlet is 4.79, which is a bit high for CH2 protons not adjacent to oxygen. Maybe it's an ether group. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Wait, but carbonyl groups don't have protons attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is for a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen atom, like in a ketone's neighboring CH2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR again. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl peak. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2, after treatment with Al isopropoxide, might form an enol ether or something else. But how?

Wait, Al isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enolate. But I'm not certain how Al isopropoxide would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the overall problem. The final step is ozonolysis of product 2, leading to product 3. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyls. So product 2 must have a double bond. Which suggests that product 1 must have an oxygen-containing group that upon treatment with Al isopropoxide forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene. Because epoxides can be opened under acidic conditions to form alkenes, but that would require a nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide ring is opened to form a carbocation which then loses a proton to form a double bond.

Wait, but without a nucleophile, how would that happen? Unless it's an elimination. Wait, epoxide ring-opening can lead to alkenes via acid-catalyzed mechanisms. For example, in the presence of a strong acid, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, the ring opens, and a carbocation forms, which can then undergo a hydride shift or lose a proton to form a double bond.

But here, Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, so it can act as a catalyst. If product 1 is an epoxide, then treating it with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) could protonate the epoxide, leading to ring-opening and formation of a carbocation, which would then lose a proton to form a double bond.

So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, considering the NMR of product 3. We need to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative groups, like carbonyls.

In the ozonolysis product, the carbonyl groups would be adjacent to some hydrogen atoms. Depending on the structure, those hydrogens could be split into certain coupling patterns.

Wait, let's think about the structure of product 3. Suppose product 2 is an alkene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have two ketone groups (if the alkene was between two CH2 groups), or maybe one aldehyde and one ketone, depending on substitution.

But in the case of adamantane's structure, breaking the double bond would split the molecule into two parts, each with a carbonyl group. So, product 3 might be two separate ketone-containing compounds, but since the starting material is symmetric, perhaps they are identical.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Each carbonyl group would have adjacent CH2 groups. For example, if the ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two (CH2) groups attached to carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. The deshielded hydrogens would be the ones next to the carbonyl, so perhaps in a CH2CO group.

In such a case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have neighboring protons. Let's think about the structure: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O.

Wait, no, that's not right. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically forms carbonyl groups at each end. So, for a structure like R-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would form R-CO and R'-CO if both ends are R groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl.

Now, considering the NMR: the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split based on their neighboring protons.

Each CH2 group would have two protons. The neighboring groups would determine the splitting. For example, if each CH2 is connected to another CH2, the protons would couple with each other.

Wait, but in the case of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the adjacent groups would be the carbonyl and another CH2. So the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would only have neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

But wait, in ozonolysis, each end of the double bond becomes a carbonyl. So, if the starting alkene was part of a larger structure, the product would have two carbonyl groups, each attached to CH2 groups. So, the structure would be something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O (but that's not quite right; perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O in a cyclic structure? Not sure.)

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diketone, like HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH, but that's not likely from ozonolysis of a simple alkene.

Wait, perhaps each end of the ozonolysis product is a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. No, that can't be right because ozonolysis would break the double bond and introduce carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that each end is a ketone. So, if the alkene was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would form two ketones: O=C-CH2 and CH2-CO, but that doesn't make sense because CH2-CO would require another carbon.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the NMR. The most deshielded protons would be next to the carbonyl, so in a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

In such a case, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split based on their coupling with neighboring protons. If each CH2 group is connected to another CH2, the protons would be adjacent to two sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps each CH2 group has two neighboring CH2 groups. So, each proton on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be coupling with protons from the adjacent CH2 group.

But wait, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2. So, for the CH2 next to the carbonyl, each proton would be split by two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2 group. That would lead to a triplet for each proton because they are coupling with two equivalent protons. But wait, no, it depends on the number of neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2 which is coupled to another group. Let's think: the CH2 next to carbonyl (let's call it CH2a) is connected to CH2b, which in turn is connected to another CH2c, and so on. But in this case, the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, maybe it's simpler. Let's imagine that each end of the ozonolysis product is a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. But that's a four-carbon chain with two ketones at each end. Wait, that wouldn't make sense because the middle would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, but that's a three-carbon chain, which isn't possible for ozonolysis of a single double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis product is a single carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, so perhaps I should think about the NMR of product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would be adjacent to a carbonyl group, likely in a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

In such a scenario, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl (let's call them H1 and H2) would be split based on their neighboring protons. Suppose each CH2 has two neighboring protons from the adjacent CH2 group. So, each H on CH2a would be adjacent to two H on CH2b.

In that case, each H on CH2a would be split into a triplet because they are coupling with two equivalent protons (n+1 rule, where n=2, so triplet).

But wait, what if there are more neighboring groups? For example, if each CH2 is adjacent to two different sets of protons. Suppose CH2a is next to CH2b, which is next to CH2c. Then, the protons on CH2a would couple with the two protons on CH2b and also with the two protons on CH2c. But that's getting complicated, so perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to only one other CH2 group.

Alternatively, if the CH2 group is next to another CH2 group which is itself next to a different group, the coupling might be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: The CH2 group next to the carbonyl is part of a cyclic structure, leading to more coupling partners. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to a CH group. So, the coupling would be with three different sets of protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

But perhaps the simplest scenario is that the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2 group. In that case, each proton on the first CH2 would couple with two protons from the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet.

But wait, what about the coupling within the CH2 group itself? The two protons on the same CH2 are equivalent and don't split each other because they are on the same carbon. So, each proton's splitting comes from the neighboring group.

So, if each H on CH2a is coupled with two H on CH2b, each would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet. However, the options also include more complex patterns, so I might be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two protons. In that case, each H would be coupled with two protons from one group and two protons from another, leading to a more complex splitting pattern, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but triplet of triplets would mean each H is split by two different sets of two protons each. So the splitting would be (n1 + 1)(n2 + 1), where n1 and n2 are the number of neighboring protons in each coupling partner.

If each H on CH2a is coupled with two H from CH2b and two H from CH2c, then the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, which would be a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H from one group and one H from another, leading to a triplet of doublets, which is still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each end becomes a carbonyl group. So, if the starting alkene was part of a structure like CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain with two ketones at the ends. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, no, that's not possible because that would imply a five-carbon chain perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O-H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis doesn't break the entire molecule but just introduces carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene was part of a bridge structure, ozonolysis might break the bridge, leading to two carbonyl groups in the same molecule.

But perhaps the structure is such that the ozonolysis product is a diketone, like O=C-R-CO, where R is a bridge structure.

In any case, the most deshielded protons would be on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls. Let's assume each CH2 is adjacent to only one other CH2 group. Then, each proton on the CH2 would be split into a triplet.

But the options include A) triplet, which would fit this scenario. However, looking back at the options, option B is triplet of triplets, which implies coupling with two different sets of two protons each.

Wait, another thought: If the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2 group which in turn is adjacent to a CH group (with two H), then each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two H on the adjacent CH2 and also with the two H on the CH group. But wait, that would require three neighboring groups, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is part of a ring, leading to more coupling. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H from the second CH2. But that would give a triplet.

Alternatively, if each H on the first CH2 also couples with another set of two H from a third CH2 group, that would lead to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the NMR data for product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would be near the carbonyl. Suppose this hydrogen is part of a CH2 group next to the carbonyl, and this CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, which is itself adjacent to a CH group.

Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is part of a chain where each CH2 is adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H on each adjacent CH2, leading to more splits.

Wait, but I'm getting too speculative here. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose the ozonolysis product is a diketone, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the CH2 groups next to each carbonyl would each have two protons. Each of these protons would be adjacent to the other CH2 group in the chain.

So, the H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to two H on the other CH2 group. Therefore, each H would be a triplet.

But the options have triplet as option A, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but wait another thing: the IR of product 1 showed a carbonyl, which suggests product 1 is a ketone. So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination.

If product 1 is a ketone, then treating it with Al isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) might promote an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. For example, if product 1 is a secondary alcohol that upon losing water forms an alkene.

Wait, no, product 1 is formed by treating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Earlier, I thought it might be a diol, but that didn't fit with the IR.

Wait, let me try again. Product 1's IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid that can facilitate Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 isn't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in an elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, ketones can undergo elimination if there's a β-hydrogen. If product 1 is a ketone with adjacent hydrogens, then treatment with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide could facilitate the elimination of a small molecule (like water) to form an alkene.

So, product 2 would be an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that into carbonyls, giving product 3 as a diketone.

Now, the NMR of product 3 would have protons adjacent to carbonyl groups. Let's say the structure is O=C-R-CO, where R is a bridge or a small chain.

Each CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl would have their protons split by neighboring groups. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would be a triplet.

But wait, in a diketone, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would be in a symmetric environment. So, each CH2 would have two neighboring H from the adjacent CH2 group. Thus, each H would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet. However, the correct answer might be a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, which has two H, and another CH2 group which has two H.

In that case, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two H from the CH group and two H from the CH2 group, leading to (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each H on the CH2 is coupled with two H from a single group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: The CH2 group next to the carbonyl is adjacent to a CH group, which has two H. So, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two H on the CH group. That would lead to a triplet for each H on the CH2.

But if the CH group is also adjacent to another CH2 group, the coupling could be more complex. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is between two CH2 groups. So, each H on this central CH2 would be adjacent to two H on each side. That would mean coupling with two groups of two H each.

In that case, each H on the central CH2 would have (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, a nonet, which isn't an option.

But the options are limited, so perhaps the correct answer is a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 group next to the carbonyl is adjacent to a single CH group. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with two H on the CH group, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the options, the most likely coupling pattern is a triplet, which would be option A.

Wait, but I recall that when a CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 is a triplet. So, if product 3's structure is such that each CH2 next to a carbonyl is adjacent to another CH2, then the H would be a triplet.

Therefore, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, so the answer is A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to three products (1, 2, 3). The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, likely undergoing a double elimination reaction. This forms a carbonyl-containing compound, as indicated by the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone. The NMR data supports this, with a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.

### Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with Al isopropoxide
Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely facilitates an elimination reaction, forming an alkene (product 2). The elimination occurs by removing a β-hydrogen, resulting in a double bond.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2
Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. Thus, product 3 is a diketone, with two carbonyl groups introduced at the positions where the double bond was cleaved.

### Step 4: NMR analysis of product 3
The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to the carbonyl. The CH₂ group is adjacent to another CH₂ group, leading to coupling with two protons from the neighboring CH₂. According to the NMR splitting rules, each proton on the CH₂ group will exhibit a triplet coupling pattern due to the two equivalent protons on the adjacent CH₂ group.

### Conclusion
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
