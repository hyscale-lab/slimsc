Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator.

Let me start by recalling what I know about harmonic oscillators. In the classical, non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = omega * A, where omega is the angular frequency and A is the amplitude. But wait, omega is sqrt(k/m), right? So non-relativistically, v_max would be sqrt(k/m) * A. Looking at the options, option C is sqrt(kA²/m), which is the same as (kA²/m)^(1/2) = A*sqrt(k/m). So that's the non-relativistic case. But since this is a relativistic problem, we can't use that directly.

In relativistic mechanics, things get a bit more complicated because as speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. So the mass isn't just m anymore; the relativistic mass is gamma times m, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

The energy in a harmonic oscillator is given by (1/2) k A² in the non-relativistic case. But relativistically, the total energy includes the rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2 gamma m), right? Because the kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma m c² - m c²). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of energy conservation.

So the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Wait, but wait. In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes (x = ±A), and the kinetic energy is maximum at the equilibrium point (x=0). So in the non-relativistic case, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, energy also includes the rest mass energy.

Wait, but the total energy in the harmonic oscillator is fixed. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero? No, wait, no, because in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is maximum at x=0. So maybe the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy at maximum amplitude and the rest energy.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's denote the total energy of the oscillator as E. At the maximum displacement x=A, the oscillator is at rest, so all the energy is potential: E = (1/2) k A². But wait, in reality, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x², so at x=A, it's (1/2)k A². But that's the non-relativistic scenario. But in the relativistic case, the total energy would also include the rest mass energy, or is that part of the potential energy? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of the energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator. The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy, but wait, no—the potential energy is part of the total energy as well. So E = gamma m c² + (1/2)k x². But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and kinetic is (1/2) m v². So perhaps in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², but I'm not sure how the potential energy fits in.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. So E = K + U, where K is the relativistic kinetic energy and U is the potential.

Wait, the potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is (1/2) k x². The kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma -1) m c². So the total energy is (gamma m c²) = (1/2) k x² + K. Wait, no. Because E_total is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So E_total = gamma m c². But the potential energy is (1/2)k x². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x=A, all the kinetic energy is zero (since it's at rest there), so E_total would be (1/2)k A² + m c². Because when x=A, the object is at rest, so gamma is 1, E_total = m c² + (1/2)k A². Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic: gamma m c² = E_total, and the potential energy is zero. So the maximum kinetic energy would be E_total - m c² = (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that's the same as the non-relativistic case. That can't be right because in the relativistic case, as the speed increases, gamma increases, which affects the energy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think in terms of energy conservation. The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be conserved. So, at any point in the motion, the sum of kinetic and potential energies is the same.

The potential energy is (1/2)k x². The kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So E = (gamma -1) m c² + (1/2)k x². This E is constant.

At the maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = (1-1)m c² + (1/2)k A² = (1/2)k A².

So at x=0, where the velocity is maximum, the potential energy is zero. So E = (gamma -1)m c² = (1/2)k A². So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

gamma = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + 1 ]

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as a term, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

gamma = (1 + alpha) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))

But wait, that's the same as:

sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1/(1 + alpha)

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let's substitute that back.

So,

v^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ]

We can rearrange that.

Let me compute the denominator inside the square:

Denominator term = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) = [2 m c^2 + k A²]/(2 m c^2 )

So the square of this is (2 m c^2 + k A²)^2 / (2 m c^2)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - (2 m c^2)^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 ) ]

But let me think in terms of the expression.

Alternative approach, perhaps simplify 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

1/(1 + alpha)^2 = (1/(1+alpha)^2)).

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

Expand (1 + alpha)^2: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

( (1 + 2 alpha + alpha²) - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2)/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 alpha (1 + (alpha/2)) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, factor numerator:

2 alpha + alpha² = alpha (2 + alpha)

Denominator: (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Substituting back,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ) ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let me denote beta = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

v^2 = c^2 [ (beta (2 + beta )) / (1 + beta)^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ beta (2 + beta) ) / ( (1 + beta)^2 ) ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is getting me closer to the answer. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can express v_max in terms of gamma.

We have gamma = 1 + beta, where beta is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma²) = 1 - 1/( (1 + beta)^2 )

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2 )

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 beta + beta² ) -1 = 2 beta + beta².

So,

v²/c² = (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta)^2.

Factor numerator: beta(2 + beta) / (1 + beta)^2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can take the square root to find v.

But I'm getting stuck on the algebra. Let me look at the options and see which fits.

The options are:

A) v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )^2 )

Wait, let me compute the denominator in option A: 1 - (kA²/(2m)). Wait, but our beta is (kA²)/(2 m c²). So the denominator in option A is 1 - (kA²/(2m) ), which is different. Because in option A, the denominator would be 1 - (k A^2/(2 m) ), but our beta is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ). So option A's denominator would be different, perhaps a larger term, since c^2 is much bigger than 1.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c^2) )) )

Wait, let me compute 1 - (beta) = 1 - (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ), which is the denominator in option B. So 1 - beta, but let me check the expression.

Wait, in option B, the expression is 1 + [1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c^2) )) ]

Wait, that would be 1 + [1/(1 - beta) ].

Is that matching anything I have?

Hmm, earlier, from gamma = 1 + beta, so gamma = 1 + beta.

Wait, but in our earlier steps,

gamma = 1 + beta, where beta is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So, gamma = ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma squared is (2 m c^2 + k A^2)^2 / ( (2 m c^2)^2 )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, let's go back to the expression for v.

From earlier,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(gamma^2) ]

Because v^2 = c^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Wait, no, wait. Because,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )

Let me rearrange this.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 / gamma^2

So,

v^2 = c^2 ( 1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Which would be,

v^2 = c^2 ( (gamma^2 - 1) ) / gamma^2 )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v in terms of gamma.

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

So,

v = c sqrt(1 - [1/(gamma^2) ] )

But gamma is 1 + beta, so,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + beta)^2 ) )

Which is,

v = c sqrt( ( (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2 beta + beta² ) - 1 = 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

v = c sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

Factor numerator,

= c sqrt( beta (2 + beta ) / (1 + beta)^2 )

= c sqrt( beta (2 + beta) ) / (1 + beta )

But beta is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

v = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none seem to match exactly what I have.

Let me check the options again.

Option A: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2m) ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the square root.

1 + [1/(1 - (k A²/(2m) ))^2 ]

But in our case, the term is (2 beta + beta^2 )/(1 + beta )^2.

Wait, perhaps I should express the options in terms of beta.

Wait, in our case, beta is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So, let me write the options in terms of beta.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - beta ) )

Hmm, 1 + 1/(1 - beta ) = [ (1 - beta ) + 1 ] / (1 - beta )

= (2 - beta ) / (1 - beta )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 - beta )/(1 - beta ) )

But our expression was v = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, not matching.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Hmm, 1 - [1/(1 + beta )^2 ]

Which is,

( (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

= (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 - 1 )/ denominator

= (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

So sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as our expression for v^2/c^2.

Wait, so,

v = c sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is,

v = c sqrt( ( (beta (2 + beta )) ) / ( (1 + beta )^2 ) )

Which is,

v = c sqrt( beta (2 + beta ) ) / (1 + beta )

But wait, option D is v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

Which is sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

So that's the same as our expression for v^2/c^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as option D's expression: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

Wait, because,

Option D says v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which is exactly the same as sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 ) times c.

Wait, but our expression for v is c times sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as:

v = c sqrt( (2 beta + beta² ) ) / (1 + beta )

But that's the same as sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2) ) = sqrt( beta (2 + beta) )

Wait, but perhaps we can factor (2 beta + beta^2) as beta (beta + 2 )

But I'm not sure. Let me think about option D.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

Which is,

v = c sqrt( ( (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

= c sqrt( (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

= c sqrt( (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is exactly what we have. So option D is correct.

Wait, but looking back, the options I have:

Option D is written as v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which matches our expression. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but wait, another approach: when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, which in the relativistic case would be (1/2)k A^2. But earlier, I thought that in the maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)k A^2, so the total energy would be (1/2)k A^2. But in reality, the total energy is (1/2)k A^2 plus the rest mass energy, because the rest mass energy is always present.

Wait, so wait—that might change my earlier approach. Let me think.

The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc^2) plus the potential and kinetic energies. So when the oscillator is at x=A, the kinetic energy is zero. So,

E = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

When the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic:

E = gamma m c^2.

So,

gamma m c^2 = mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

Divide both sides by mc^2:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as before. So the rest of the steps follow, leading us to option D.

So, the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is conserved and includes the rest mass energy, potential energy, and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, and all the energy is potential:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]  
   At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), the velocity is maximum, and all the energy is kinetic:  
   \[
   E = \gamma m c^2
   \]  
   Equating the two expressions for \( E \):  
   \[
   \gamma m c^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   Dividing through by \( mc^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Rearranging to solve for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
