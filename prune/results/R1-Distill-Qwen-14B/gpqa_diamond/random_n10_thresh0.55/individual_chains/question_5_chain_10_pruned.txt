Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem is about a muon, which is like a lepton, similar to an electron but heavier. The operator in question is P, a vector operator, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's σ_x multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because the Pauli matrices are like that. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y times ħ/2. And P_z is (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so σ_z times ħ/2.

So the operator P is a vector operator, and when you have a vector operator, the total operator along a direction n is given by the dot product of the vector components with the direction vector. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Oh wait, but the direction is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n is zero, right? Because any direction in the x-z plane would have n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something like that. Wait, actually, in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or 180, but wait, no, maybe the direction is (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane. So n lies in the x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). So the vector could be represented as a unit vector with n_y=0.

So the operator P_n, which is the component along n, would be n · vec P. So that would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z because n_y is zero.

Our eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2 of the operator P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but since P is a vector operator, I think the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2, right? Because for each component like P_x, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

So the operator P_n is a combination of P_x and P_z. Let me write it out.

P_n = n_x (ħ/2)σ_x + n_z (ħ/2)σ_z.

But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. Because it's in the x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), so normalizing, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, no, let me think: usually, in spherical coordinates, θ
