Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully and think through each step.

The question is about comparing the luminosities of two stars based on some given parameters. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. But wait, the mass might not directly affect the luminosity calculation here. The problem says the stars radiate as black bodies, so I think the key factors are their radius, temperature, and maybe their velocities.

The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = (hc)/(5kT), where T is the temperature, but wait, I think the exact formula is λ_max * T = constant. Or more accurately, Wien's displacement law states that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same for both, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Hmm, but wait, the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that means the peak emission for both is at the same λ, implying the same T. Got it.

Now, the next part is about radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh right, the Doppler shift. So if a star is moving towards us (radial velocity negative?), the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But wait, in this case, Star_1 has 0, so no shift. Star_2 has 700 km/s, but the direction isn't specified. Wait, the problem just says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s or towards us? Wait, radial velocity is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards, I think. But the question says the observed wavelengths are the same. Hmm, not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, maybe I should think about how this affects the observed temperature.

Wait, no, the initial part says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So this is the observed λ_max. So without considering the Doppler shift, their actual temperatures would be the same if they have the same λ_max. But because of their velocities, the observed λ may differ. Wait, no, the problem states that the observed λ are the same, so the Doppler effect must have adjusted the actual temperatures. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem states that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and those are the same. So from the observed spectrum, the λ_max is the same for both. So, the observed wavelength is the same. But the actual temperature of each star depends on their velocity.

Wait, I might be mixing something up. The temperature each star emits at is T, but due to their radial velocity, the observed temperature could be different. Wait no, the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, so the observed temperature would be different. Let
