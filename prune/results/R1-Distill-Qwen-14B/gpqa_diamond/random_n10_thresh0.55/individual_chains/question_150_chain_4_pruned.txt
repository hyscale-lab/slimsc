Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me see. So the question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Hmm, the molecular formula might help in figuring out the structure after the reactions. The degrees of unsaturation can be calculated. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be like one ring and four double bonds, or a combination of rings and double bonds. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 DoU) and a couple more rings or double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

Other signals:
- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. Maybe aromatic protons, perhaps para substituted. Like an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions.
- 6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H. Also aromatic, possibly ortho to substituents.
- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H. Could be vinyl protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in an enol or something. Or maybe adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.
- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H. This looks like a CH2 group next to an oxygen, maybe an OCH2CH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 attached to an aromatic ring and next to an oxygen, like in a methoxy group but the integration is 2H, so maybe two protons on a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Putting it together: The aldehyde proton suggests an aldehyde group. The aromatic signals might come from a phenyl group. There's a CH2 group attached to something else, maybe an aromatic ring or an oxygen.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a singlet for 2H. If it's a double bond, maybe it's a conjugated diene or part of an aromatic system. Alternatively, it could be a pair of protons on a substituted double bond. Hmm, but the integration is 2H as a broad singlet. Broad usually indicates exchange, maybe in an acidic environment. Like OH protons, but that's for 1H, but here it's 2H. Wait, or maybe it's a pair of protons on a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, but that's the 3.66 ppm. So perhaps the 6.27 is two protons on a double bond adjacent to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think. Let's try to sketch the structure. Suppose we have a
