Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that the excitation state of atoms in a star's atmosphere can tell us a lot about the temperature. When atoms are more excited, that usually means higher temperature, because higher energy levels are populated more.

Wait, but how exactly does that work? Oh yeah, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The distribution tells us the number of particles in a particular energy state relative to the ground state. The formula is something like the ratio of populations between two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So the setup is that the number of excited iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for a specific energy level. Let me denote the number of atoms in the excited state as N_1 for star_1 and N_2 for star_2. According to the problem, N_1 = 2 * N_2.

The Boltzmann equation for the ratio of populations is:

N_1 / N_2 = (g_1 / g_2) * exp( - (E_1 - E_2) / (k*T) )

Where g_1 and g_2 are the statistical weights of the energy levels. If the problem is about the same transition, maybe the statistical weights are the same? Or perhaps it's comparing the same energy levels in both stars. Wait, the problem says the energy difference is the same for both stars, so E_1 - E_2 is the same, let's say ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So assuming the statistical weights g_1 and g_2 are the same for both stars (since it's the same transition), the ratio simplifies to just the exponential term.

So the ratio N_1 / N_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. Actually, each star has its own temperature. For star 1, the population ratio would be N1/N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Wait no, N1 is the excited state and N2 is the ground state in each star? Or is it the ratio between the two stars?

Wait, no. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps for each star, the population of the specific energy level relative to the ground state is different.

Wait, I think I should model it as each star having its own ratio. For star 1, the ratio of excited to ground state is N1_excited / N1_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Similarly, for star 2, it's N2_excited / N2_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ).

But the problem states that the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So I think they are comparing the populations relative to their own ground states. So the ratio N1_excited / N1_ground = 2 * (N2_excited / N2_ground ). Because for the same energy levels, but different stars.

Wait, no, perhaps the problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But that's not necessarily considering their ground states. Maybe it's the ratio of the excited state population to the total population in each star? Or are they just comparing the excited state counts?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me rephrase the problem. In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level compared to star_2. So if I take the ratio of the excited state population in star_1 to that in star_2, that's 2:1.

But wait, each star's population depends on their own temperature. So, the ratio (N1_excited / N2_excited) = 2.

But each star's excited state population is determined by their respective Boltzmann factors. So:

N1_excited = N1_ground * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
N2_excited = N2_ground * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio N1_excited / N2_excited = [N1_ground / N2_ground ] * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but I'm not sure if the ground state populations are the same for both stars. Or perhaps the ratio of excited to ground in each star is given, and we're told that in star 1, the excited is twice that of star 2. So:

(N1_excited / N1_ground ) / (N2_excited / N2_ground ) = 2.

Which simplifies to [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = 2.

Because for each star, N_excited / N_ground is exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So that ratio becomes exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = 2.

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = 2.

Taking natural log on both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Then rearranging:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2) * k / ΔE

Wait, but the problem asks for an equation relating T1 and T2. So let's see.

Alternatively, let's write the equation as:

ΔE/(k) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by (k/ΔE):

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

But perhaps we can rearrange terms differently. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps we can factor this as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ( ln(2) ) * (k / ΔE )

Hmm, but the question gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J, which is a specific value. But I think the exact value may not matter for the form of the equation.

Wait, but the problem is giving me multiple choices, all in terms of T1 and T2. So perhaps I can write the equation in terms of T1 and T2.

So the equation is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ( ln(2) ) * ( k / ΔE )

But I don't see any of the answer options showing such a term. Let me see the options again.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, none of these seem to match the (1/T2 - 1/T1) term. So perhaps I should manipulate the equation further.

Let me write 1/T2 - 1/T1 as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting that into the equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln 2 ) * (k / ΔE )

So rearranged, that gives:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] * (ΔE) / (k )

Wait, but the right-hand side is a product of (ΔE / k) and (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Since ΔE and k are known constants (given in the problem), perhaps in the answer, the equation would involve (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) equals something involving ln(2).

Wait, but the options don't have any constants like ΔE or k. So perhaps the equation is rearranged as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) ] * (k / ΔE )

But in the given options, the RHS is just ln(2) multiplied by a function of T1 and T2.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me get back to the ratio.

Earlier, I had:

N1_excited / N2_excited = 2.

Each N_excited is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming the ground state populations are the same for both stars. Or if the ground state populations vary as well, but perhaps that's a more complicated scenario.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio N1_excited / N2_excited = 2, and each excited population is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking natural log:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which rearranged is:

(1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

But again, we can write 1/T2 -1/T1 as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

But the answer options don't have any presence of k or ΔE, so perhaps the equation is written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) ] * (k / ΔE )

But in the options, the only equation that has (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But in our case, the left side is ln(2), and the right side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by some constants (like k and ΔE). But the given options don't account for that. So perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the excitation is higher in star_1, which implies that T1 is higher than T2, right? Because higher temperature leads to more excitation.

Wait, but in the equation, (T1 - T2) is positive, so the right-hand side is positive, which would make ln(2) positive, which it is. So that makes sense.

But looking at the options, none have the same structure as our equation. Unless the given options are considering only the ratio of temperatures, not the temperatures themselves.

Wait another approach: perhaps the ratio of the excitation is N1/N2 = 2.

The excitation ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor for each star.

So N1 = N2 * exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because N1 is the excited state in star_1, N2 is in star_2.

So N1/N2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Take ln of both sides:

(ΔE / k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

We can rearrange:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln 2) * k / ΔE

Which can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (ln2) * k / ΔE

But this doesn't directly match any of the answer options. So perhaps the options assume that ΔE and k are constants and the equation is in terms of T1 and T2 as variables.

But the answer options have ln(2) equals functions of T1 and T2. So perhaps I should manipulate it further.

Let me denote the ratio (1/T2 - 1/T1) as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) = ln(2) * k / ΔE

But in the answer options, the equation is ln(2) equals something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the problem by considering that the energy difference is much smaller and the temperatures are similar, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the populations in the same energy level in each star, but considering the ground state as the same. So perhaps the ratio of the excited states is (g_1 / g_2) * exp( ... ), but if g_1 = g_2, then it's just the exponential.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio of the excitation temperatures. Wait, excitation temperature is a concept in spectroscopy where T_exc = ΔE/(k ln r), where r is the ratio of populations.

In this case, star_1 has an excitation ratio r1 = N1_excited / N1_ground, and star_2 has r2 = N2_excited / N2_ground.

Given that r1 = 2 r2.

So r1 = 2 r2.

Excitation temperatures T1 and T2 are given by T1 = ΔE/(k ln r1) and T2 = ΔE/(k ln r2).

So substituting r1 = 2 r2:

T1 = ΔE/(k ln (2 r2 )) 
T2 = ΔE/(k ln r2 )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's write the ratio r1/r2 = 2.

r1/r2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 
= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

So, taking ln:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Which brings us back to the same equation as before.

So, going back to the options, perhaps I can express 1/T2 - 1/T1 as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Thus,

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But this doesn't fit any of the options. The options don't include ΔE or k, so perhaps the problem is assuming that (ΔE)/(k) is a constant factor, and then the equation can be written as ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by a constant.

But without that, the only option that has (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

But that would imply that (ΔE/k) is 1, which isn't necessarily the case. Since the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, and k is about 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE is about k * 1 K (since 1.38e-23 J is k).

Wait, wait! Let me compute ΔE/(k).

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k * (1 K)

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

So that term is just 1. So,

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * 1

Which simplifies to ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that matches option D.

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation state of atoms is governed by the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature of the system. The key equation is:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{excited}}}{N_{\text{ground}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of the excited state populations is given as \( N_{\text{excited,1}} / N_{\text{excited,2}} = 2 \). Using the Boltzmann distribution for both stars, the ratio of the populations can be written as:

\[
\frac{N_{\text{excited,1}}}{N_{\text{excited,2}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The term \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) can be rewritten as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), so:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the ratio \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
