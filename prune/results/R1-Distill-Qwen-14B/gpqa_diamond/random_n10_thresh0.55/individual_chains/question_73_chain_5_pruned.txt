Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think this through.

First, let me read the problem carefully. Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. Oh, right, when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally like in classical mechanics. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for energy, since they're moving at relativistic speeds, I think I should consider their relativistic energies, not just kinetic.

So, starting with the relative speed. The formula for relative velocity in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), but wait, that's when the velocities are in opposite directions. Or is it when one is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction? Let me clarify.

Oh, right, when both objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of one from the other's frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference in their speeds divided by that factor. Let me double-check the formula.

Alternatively, I remember the formula for adding velocities in relativity. If an object A is moving at u relative to
