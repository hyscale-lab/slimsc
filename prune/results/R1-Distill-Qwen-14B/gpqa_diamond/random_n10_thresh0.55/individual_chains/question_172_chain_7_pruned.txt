Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres, and I need to figure out which equation correctly relates their effective temperatures based on the given information. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between these energy levels is 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Also, the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which probably means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system to temperature. The formula, if I recall correctly, is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and E_i and E_j are the energies of the states.

In this case, the energy difference is given, so E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J. Let's call that delta E. The number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. So, n1 / n2 = 2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about which way the ratio goes. Let me think. Suppose for star_1, the excited state is twice as populated as in star_2. So, n1 is the population of the excited state in star_1, and n2 is the same in star_2. So n1/n2 = 2.

But actually, wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the population of the excited state (n_upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2.

But the Boltzmann distribution usually compares the same energy states across different systems. So perhaps for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is considered. Wait, maybe I should model this as each star having a certain ratio based on their own temperatures.

Wait, another approach. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states (i and j) is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). So if the energy difference is E_upper - E_lower = delta E, then the ratio for each star would be:

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )
For star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

But wait, the problem states that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, I think the question says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, that might not be directly the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to another state or perhaps the total number is considered.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says that the specific energy level is twice as excited in star_1. So, perhaps the ratio of the populations in that level is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2. So n1/n2 =
