Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds... so I probably can't just use classical mechanics here. I remember that at speeds comparable to the speed of light, I have to use Einstein's theory of relativity.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So each of them is moving, and I think I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, for the relative speed, I can't just subtract their velocities like in classical mechanics because at high speeds, the effects of relativity become significant. I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity comes into play here. The formula, if I remember right, is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, both are moving in the same direction. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Let me plug that in.

So plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute the numerator and denominator. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c which is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So that's a start.

Now, for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Let's calculate his gamma. v is 0.6c, so v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Let me compute sqrt(0.75). 0.75 is 3/4, so sqrt is about 0.8660. So gamma is approximately 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 3 * 1.1547 is 3.4641 m c². So adding E1 and
