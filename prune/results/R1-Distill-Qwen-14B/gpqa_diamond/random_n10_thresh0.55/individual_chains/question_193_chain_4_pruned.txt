Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. The options are about how N depends on r, right?

Wait, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So if r increases, plx decreases.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/r, that becomes 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/(1/r^5)) is r^5. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as (r/1)^5, which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5? But wait, that's the proportionality. But wait, the question says how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the number of stars in a region varies with 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/(r^5). So 1/(plx^5) would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5. So
