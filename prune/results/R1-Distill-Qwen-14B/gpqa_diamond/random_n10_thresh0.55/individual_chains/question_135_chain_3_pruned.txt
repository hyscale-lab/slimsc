Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle physics. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian. 

So, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf(y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about that notation. Oh right, I think it's a Yukawa-type interaction because it involves a boson (X) coupling to fermions. The general form of Yukawa interactions is something like λ ψ† ψ X, which is what this seems to be. So X is a boson field interacting with some fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the allowed decay products at the lowest order. So, in particle physics, when a particle decays, the decay products must have enough energy and satisfy conservation laws. Since X is a boson, specifically probably a scalar, since the interaction is Yukawa-like (which is scalar), the decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, what's the mass threshold for the decay? Well, the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion for the decay to happen. So, the decay X → f f-bar is allowed only if m_X ≥ 2 m_f.

So the fermions that can be produced are those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because 6 GeV divided by 2. Let's check the masses of the known fermions.

The known fermion masses (approximate) are:
- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.77 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but I don't think they're considered here as decay products unless X is a neutrino, which it's not.

Wait, but the decay X→f f-bar would
