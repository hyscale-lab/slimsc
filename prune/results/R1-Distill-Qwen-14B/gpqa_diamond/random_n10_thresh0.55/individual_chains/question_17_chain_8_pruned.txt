Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. 

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stochiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-? I think so because EDTA typically forms complexes with metal ions in a 1:1 ratio. So the complex is CaY²-, where Y is EDTA.

The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I think K here is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. 

The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions. So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- (probably as Y), but since the K is so large, the degree of dissociation should be really small. 

Let me think of the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaY²-. The formation constant Kf is [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but sometimes people use the dissociation constant Kd, which would be [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaY²-] = 1/Kf. Since Kf is given as 5e10, Kd would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

Wait, but the problem gives K as KCa-EDTA, which I think refers to the formation constant. So the setup is that the complex is formed as CaY²- with a formation constant Kf = 5e10. 

So, in solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of each of them would be x. But wait, but we started with the complex, which is 0.02 M, so is that the initial concentration before dissociation? Or is it the total concentration, including dissociation
