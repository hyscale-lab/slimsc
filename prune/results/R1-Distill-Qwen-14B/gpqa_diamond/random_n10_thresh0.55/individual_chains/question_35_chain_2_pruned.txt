Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator Ay, which is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. 

Wait, let's break it down. The operator Ay is c*S. The given matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). I think that's the Pauli Y matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and the Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So S is sigma_y.

The constant c is h/(4π). Oh wait, Planck's constant h is used here. But in many cases, when dealing with angular momentum, especially spin-½ particles, the eigenvalues are often given in terms of ħ, which is h/(2π). So I should keep that in mind.

The problem says Ay = c * S. So substituting c, we have Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y. 

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. Since sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are known. The Pauli matrices (sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z) all have eigenvalues ±1. So, sigma_y has eigenvalues 1 and -1.

So substituting into Ay, the eigenvalues a would be (h/(4π)) * (±1). So a can be h/(4π) or -h/(4π). Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because Ay = c * S, so when S acts on an eigenstate, it gives ±1, so multiplying by c gives eigenvalues c*(±1), which is ±c. So yes, a is ±h/(4π).

But looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because if Ay is a real multiple of sigma_y, which is a complex matrix but has real eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues should be real. So option A is probably wrong because it mentions an imaginary part. 

Option B: It says the imaginary part is ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But wait, eigenvalues of Ay are
