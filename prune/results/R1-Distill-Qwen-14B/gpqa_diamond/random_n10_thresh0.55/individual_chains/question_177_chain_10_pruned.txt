Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The first thing I notice is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but how does mass relate to luminosity? Hmm, maybe I should think about the properties that directly affect luminosity.

The question mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. Since the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because according to Wien's Law, same λ_max implies same T, assuming same constant. Oh wait, but wait—could other factors influence this? No, I think that's correct. So both stars have the same temperature.

But wait, wait a minute. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh wait, so the observed wavelength (what we measure) could be different from the actual emitted wavelength. Oh, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So we're seeing the same λ_max in their spectra, but the actual emitted wavelengths might be different because of their velocities?

Wait, that complicates things. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But due to their radial velocities, the actual λ_max (emitted by the star) could be different. Hmm, so I might have to correct for the Doppler shift to find their actual temperatures.

Let me think about this. The Doppler effect for light changes the observed wavelength. The formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than the speed of light, which it is in this case (700 km/s is about 0.23% of light speed, so approximation might be possible). Alternatively, there's a simpler approximation when v_r is small. The relativistic Doppler shift formula can be approx
