Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, what do stability constants mean again? Oh right, each β represents the formation constant for a complex. So, β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, then β2 for the second, like [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on. Each step adds another SCN- ion.

The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the third one, I think. Wait no, wait. Wait, the blue complexes are the ones with two SCN- ions? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, I remember that the different complexes have different colors. The more SCN- ions, the more stable the complex. The first complex might be pink, the second blue, and so on. But I'm not sure about the exact colors, but the dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ions. So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^(n) complex. Which is β2 or β3? Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions. So for n=1, β1=9; n=2, β2=40; n=3, β3=63; n=4, β4=16.

Wait, but when n=4, the β is lower than the others. Does that mean it's less stable? Because β3 is the largest, so that complex is the most stable. So maybe the dominant species is the one with three SCN- ions.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions. So I need to find the fraction of Co with
