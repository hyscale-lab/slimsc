Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question is about iron atoms in two stars and how excited they are in a specific energy level. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, things like the excitation of atoms are related to temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. 

So the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. And weâ€™re assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which I think means the usual statistical mechanics apply.

The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels. The formula I remember is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) will depend on their temperatures. Let me think: the energy levels have a difference of Delta E = 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the ratio of excited to non-excited atoms is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think the ratio of the populations (excited to ground) for star_1 is double that of star_2. But wait, the question might be comparing the excitation directly, so perhaps the ratio
