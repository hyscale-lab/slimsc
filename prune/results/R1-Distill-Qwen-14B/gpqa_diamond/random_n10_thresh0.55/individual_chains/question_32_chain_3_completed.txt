Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. That means the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which I think is a 6Li nucleus.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. When particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic effects become significant. So I need to calculate the total energy of the ion. 

The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ * m₀c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the equation.

Let me compute γ first. v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate more accurately. Let me compute 0.96^2 again: 0.96 * 0.96. Let's see, 0.96 * 96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So yes, γ is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 atomic mass unit (u), approximately 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. But wait, wait. Actually, the mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6 times the mass of a nucleon because of binding energy, but in particle physics, when considering heavy ions in colliders, the rest mass is often approximated as A times the nucleon mass. Or is it the atomic mass including electrons? Hmm, wait, the nucleus is a bare nucleus, but when calculating the rest mass, it's based on the atomic mass minus the electrons. Wait, no, actually, the mass of the nucleus is slightly less than A u because of the binding energy. But maybe for this problem, we can approximate the mass as 6 u, considering that the binding energy for light nuclei isn't that significant compared to the total mass. But wait, I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the exact value by looking up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, the problem mentions that X is Li with 3 neutrons, so that's 6Li. The standard atomic weight of 6Li is about 6.01512 u. Hmm, but when considering the nucleus alone, the mass is slightly different because the atomic mass includes electrons. For a Li atom, the neutral atom has 3 electrons. Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So, the actual mass of the nucleus would be the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons plus the binding energy correction. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I can calculate the mass of the 6Li nucleus as if it's A=6, and each nucleon is approximately 1 u, but with a slight adjustment. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just use the atomic mass of 6Li as the mass of the nucleus. Wait, no. The atomic mass includes the electrons. So to get the mass of just the nucleus, I should subtract the electrons' mass from the atomic mass. Let me see. The atomic mass of 6Li is approximately 6.01512 u. A Li atom has 3 electrons, each with a mass of about 0.00054858 u. So the mass of the nucleus would be 6.01512 u - 3 * 0.00054858 u.

Let me compute that. 3 * 0.00054858 is approximately 0.00164574 u. So subtracting that from 6.01512 gives 6.01347426 u. Hmm, but wait, actually, the atomic mass includes the rest mass of the electrons, but when you have the nucleus, you're considering the bare nucleus, which would have 3 fewer electrons. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass plus the binding energy. Wait, no, the atomic mass includes the nucleus plus the electrons. So the nucleus mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass. 

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the lithium nucleus as approximately 6 u. Or perhaps, more accurately, using the exact atomic mass. Let me look up the exact atomic mass of 6Li. From what I recall, the atomic mass of 6Li is about 6.01512277 u. So the mass of the nucleus would be 6.01512277 u minus 3 * (electron mass in u). The electron mass is about 0.0005485799 u. So 3 * 0.0005485799 is approximately 0.00164574 u. So subtracting that: 6.01512277 - 0.00164574 = 6.01347703 u.

But wait, that's for the Li atom. The nucleus would be the atom minus the electrons. So yes, the nucleus has a mass of approximately 6.013477 u. But wait, isn't this a bit more precise than necessary? Maybe, but for the sake of accuracy, I'll proceed with this value.

Alternatively, sometimes in particle physics, when calculating the energy for a nucleus, the mass is taken as A times the mass of a proton (with some adjustment), but perhaps for this problem, using the exact atomic mass is better.

So, the mass m₀ is 6.013477 u.

Now, I need to convert this mass into kilograms because the standard unit for energy in physics is joules, but since the options are in GeV, I can work in terms of u and c², and then convert to GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². Wait, more accurately, 1 u = 931.494061 MeV/c². So m₀c² is 6.013477 u * 931.494061 MeV/c²/u.

Calculating that gives m₀c² in MeV. Let me compute that.

6.013477 * 931.494061 ≈ ?

Hmm, 6 * 931.5 is 5589. So 6.013477 is approximately 6.013477. Let me compute 6 * 931.494 = 5588.964, 0.013477 * 931.494 ≈ 12.57. So total m₀c² is approximately 5588.964 +12.57 = 5601.534 MeV, which is 5.601534 GeV.

Wait, wait, but let me compute this more accurately.

6.013477 * 931.494061:

Calculating 6 * 931.494061 = 5588.964366 MeV.

Then 0.013477 * 931.494061:

0.013477 * 931.494 ≈ Let's compute 0.01 *931.494 = 9.31494, 0.003477 *931.494 ≈ 3.246 (since 0.003 *931.494=2.794, 0.000477 *931.494≈0.445). So total is approximately 9.31494 +2.794 +0.445 ≈12.55394 MeV.

Adding that to 5588.964 gives 5588.964 +12.55394 = 5601.51794 MeV, which is 5.60151794 GeV.

So m₀c² is approximately 5.6015 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second: the nucleus's mass is 6.013477 u? Or did I make a mistake earlier? Let me double-check. The atomic mass of 6Li is 6.01512 u. Subtracting the 3 electrons (each 0.00054858 u):

6.01512 - 3*(0.00054858) = 6.01512 - 0.00164574 = 6.01347426 u.

So that's correct. So m₀c² is 6.01347426 u * 931.494 MeV/u = approximately 5.6015 GeV.

Wait, but wait again: the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008664 u. So for 6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the expected mass would be 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008664) = let's compute that.

3*(1.007276) = 3.021828, 3*(1.008664)=3.025992. Total is 6.04782 u. But the actual atomic mass of 6Li is 6.01512 u, which is significantly less. So the difference is due to the binding energy and electrons.

But perhaps I should instead take the mass of the nucleus as 6.01347426 u, which I calculated earlier.

Anyway, moving on. The rest energy is approximately 5.6015 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma times m0c^2. Gamma is approximately 3.5714. So E = 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV.

Let me compute this.

3.5714 * 5.6015:

Hmm, 3.5 *5.6 is 19.6. Let me break it down. 3 *5.6015 is 16.8045. 0.5714 *5.6015 ≈ 3.2 (since 0.5*5.6 is 2.8, 0.0714*5.6≈0.399, so total about 3.199). So total is 16.8045 +3.199≈19.0035 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.6015.

Compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6015 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0015=0.0053571.

So 2.14284 +0.0053571 =2.1481971.

So total is 17.857 +2.1481971 = 20.005197 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.005 GeV. But wait, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6015 step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as 3.5714 *5.6015 = ?

Let me break it down:

Compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

Compute 3.5714 *0.6015:

0.6 *3.5714 =2.14284.

0.0015 *3.5714=0.0053571.

So adding, 2.14284 +0.0053571=2.1481971.

So total is 17.857 + 2.1481971 = 20.005197 GeV.

So approximately 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option B is 23.069 GeV, and option A is 18.475, option D is 21.419.

Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy between my rough calculation and the options? Let me see where I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Because the mass of the nucleus is 6.013477 u, which gives m0c^2 as 6.013477 * 931.494 ≈ let me compute that accurately.

Calculating 6.013477 * 931.494:

Let me compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

Then 0.013477 *931.494. Let me compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494.

0.003477 *931.494 = ?

Calculating 0.003 *931.494 =2.794482.

0.000477 *931.494 = let's see: 0.0004 *931.494=0.3725976, 0.000077 *931.494= approximately 0.071929.

So 0.3725976 +0.071929 = 0.4445266.

So 2.794482 +0.4445266 =3.2390086.

So 0.013477 *931.494 ≈9.31494 +3.2390086 =12.5539486 MeV.

So m0c^2 is 5588.964 +12.5539486 =5601.5179486 MeV =5.6015179486 GeV.

So m0c^2 is approximately 5.6015 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.5714, so E=gamma * m0c^2 =3.5714 *5.6015 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.5714 *5.6015:

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6015 = ?

Compute 3.5714 *0.6=2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0015=0.0053571.

Total: 2.14284 +0.0053571=2.1481971.

So 17.857 +2.1481971=20.005197 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.005 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher. So perhaps I missed something in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think again. 6Li has a mass of 6.01512277 u for the atom. The atomic mass includes the electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is atomic mass minus the electrons.

Wait, each Li atom has 3 electrons. The mass of each electron is about 0.0005485799 u. So 3 electrons would be 0.0016457397 u.

So nucleus mass = 6.01512277 u - 0.0016457397 u =6.01347703 u.

So that part was correct.

Wait, but wait, I've just realized that the mass of the nucleus might actually be the sum of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But when using the atomic mass, the binding energy is already accounted for, so I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma with more precision.

Given v=0.96c, so v²/c² =0.96^2=0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.6015179486 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely.

3.57142857 *5.6015179486.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.6015179486 =16.8045538458.

0.57142857 *5.6015179486.

Compute 0.5 *5.6015179486=2.8007589743.

0.07142857 *5.6015179486.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

1/14 *5.6015179486 ≈5.6015179486 /14 ≈0.4001084249.

So 2.8007589743 +0.4001084249=3.2008674.

So total E=16.8045538458 +3.2008674≈20.0054212 GeV.

So approximately 20.005 GeV.

But the options don't have that exactly. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me double-check.

Wait, the mass of the 6Li nucleus is 6.013477 u, which I converted to 5.6015 GeV. But wait, another thought: perhaps the mass should be considered as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, not the atomic mass. Let me think. For heavy ions, sometimes the mass is taken as A times the mass of a nucleon. So each nucleon has a mass of approximately 1 u. So for 6Li, that would be 6 u. But the actual atomic mass is 6.013477 u, which is about 6.0135 u. Wait, that's about 6 u, so the difference is small.

Wait, let me compute using 6 u as the mass.

m0c² =6 u *931.494 MeV/u =6*931.494 =5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

Then E=gamma *5.588964 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.588964 =?

Let me compute that.

3 *5.588964=16.766892.

0.57142857 *5.588964.

0.5 *5.588964=2.794482.

0.07142857 *5.588964 ≈0.400544.

So 2.794482 +0.400544 ≈3.195026.

Total E=16.766892 +3.195026≈20. (16.766892+3.195026=19.961918 GeV). So about 19.9619 GeV, which is approximately 19.96 GeV.

So this gives about 19.96 GeV, which is still close to 20 GeV, but the options don't have this exactly.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than my two calculations, 20.005 GeV and 19.96 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma and the mass.

Let me calculate gamma more precisely. Since v=0.96c, beta is 0.96. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784). The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is 3.5714285714...

Now, the mass of the 6Li nucleus: perhaps I should use the exact value from the periodic table.

The exact atomic mass of 6Li is 6.01512277 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.01512277 u minus 3 electrons (each 0.0005485799 u) =6.01512277 - 0.0016457397=6.01347703 u.

So m0c² =6.01347703 u *931.494061 MeV/u = let me compute this precisely.

6.01347703 *931.494061 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494061 =5588.964366 MeV.

0.01347703 *931.494061 = let me compute that.

0.01 *931.494061=9.31494061.

0.00347703 *931.494061.

Compute 0.003*931.494061=2.79448218.

0.00047703 *931.494061 =let me compute 0.0004 *931.494061=0.372597624, 0.00007703 *931.494061≈0.071929.

Adding: 0.372597624 +0.071929=0.444526624.

So 2.79448218 +0.444526624=3.239008804 MeV.

So total for 0.01347703 *931.494061 is 9.31494061 +3.239008804=12.55394941 MeV.

So m0c² =5588.964366 +12.55394941 =5601.518315 MeV =5.601518315 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m0c^2 =3.5714285714 *5.601518315 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

3.5714285714 *5.601518315.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.601518315=16.804554945.

0.5714285714 *5.601518315.

Compute 0.5 *5.601518315=2.8007591575.

0.0714285714 *5.601518315.

Compute 0.07 *5.601518315=0.392106282.

0.0014285714 *5.601518315≈0.00799759.

So 0.392106282 +0.00799759=0.40010387.

Now, adding 2.8007591575 +0.40010387 =3.2008630275.

So total E=16.804554945 +3.2008630275 =20.00541797 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0054 GeV. But looking at the options, the closest is option C:20.132 GeV, which is about 20.132, which is about 0.13 GeV higher than our calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me consider that maybe the mass should be 6 u, not the adjusted 6.013477 u.

If m0 is 6 u, then m0c²=6 *931.494 MeV =5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.588964 GeV.

Compute that precisely.

5.588964 *3.57142857.

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.588964 *3.57142857.

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.088964 *3.57142857 ≈0.317263.

So 1.785714285 +0.317263≈2.102977.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.102977≈19.960119 GeV.

So about 19.96 GeV. Still not matching any option except perhaps option C is higher. Wait, but our earlier calculation with the exact mass gave us about 20.005 GeV. So why is that?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass used is per nucleon, but for a heavy nucleus, sometimes the rest mass is taken as (A * m_p), where m_p is the proton mass. But for 6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, that would be 3*(m_p + m_n). But let me check the exact values.

The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008664 u. So 3*(1.007276 +1.008664) =3*(2.01594)=6.04782 u. But that's higher than the actual atomic mass of 6Li. So the actual nucleus mass is 6.013477 u, which is 6.013477 u. So that's a difference. The difference is due to the binding energy, which is about (6.04782 -6.013477)=0.034343 u, which is about 31.7 MeV.

But wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass as (A) * (mass of proton), but I don't think that would be correct. Because in that case, the mass would be higher than reality, leading to a higher energy.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value of the mass of the Li nucleus as 6 * (mass of proton) + binding energy, but that's complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and use m0 =6 * m_p, but that would give a much higher mass.

Wait, let me try that approach. m_p is 1.007276 u. So 6 *1.007276 u=6.043656 u.

m0c²=6.043656 u *931.494 MeV/u =6.043656 *931.494 ≈ let's compute this.

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.043656 *931.494 ≈ let's compute:

0.04 *931.494=37.25976.

0.003656 *931.494 ≈3.4034.

So total for 0.043656 *931.494≈40.66316 MeV.

So m0c²=5588.964 +40.66316=5629.62716 MeV=5.629627 GeV.

Now, E=3.57142857 *5.629627 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.629627=16.888881.

0.57142857 *5.629627.

0.5 *5.629627=2.8148135.

0.07142857 *5.629627≈0.402053.

So 2.8148135 +0.402053=3.2168665.

Total E=16.888881 +3.2168665=20.1057475 GeV.

Ah, this gives approximately 20.106 GeV, which is close to option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, this approach assumes that the mass is 6 * m_p, which might not be accurate. Because in reality, the mass of the 6Li nucleus is about 6.013477 u, which is about 0.03 less than 6 * m_p. So perhaps the problem expects me to use m0=6 u.

Wait, if I take m0=6 u, then m0c^2=6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.588964.

Let me compute this.

3.57142857 *5.588964.

Let me compute 3.5 *5.588964=19.561374.

0.07142857 *5.588964≈0.400573.

So total E=19.561374 +0.400573≈19.961947 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.96 GeV, which is still lower than option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 * (m_p + m_n)/2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the mass of the entire ion, including electrons. Because sometimes, when dealing with ions in colliders, the charge state is considered, but I'm not sure. Wait, but for a bare nucleus, the electrons are stripped away, so their mass shouldn't be part of the nucleus's mass.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic energy per nucleon, but the question is about the nucleus as a whole.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the mass as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. So for 6Li, 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each ~1 u, so 6 u. Then m0c²=6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV=5.588964 GeV.

Then E=gamma *5.588964 GeV=3.57142857 *5.588964 ≈19.96 GeV.

But none of the options are exactly 19.96. The closest options are C)20.132 and D)21.419.

Wait, let me see the options again.

Options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, given that, option C is the closest to my calculation when using 6 u for the mass.

But when I used the exact mass of 6.013477 u, I got E≈20.005 GeV. But that's still not exactly matching any option except perhaps the closest option is C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma more accurately.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the energy per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus as a whole.

Another possibility: perhaps the speed is 0.96c, so relativistic mass is gamma*m0. But no, the energy is gamma*m0*c^2, which includes the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of (1 - (0.96)^2) in gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. 1 -0.96^2 =1 -0.9216=0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714...

Another thought: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is given as the sum of the individual nucleons, not considering binding energy. So for 6Li, it's 6 *1.007 u (proton and neutron average), but that would be 6 *1.007=6.042 u.

Wait, let me compute that.

m0=6.042 u.

m0c^2=6.042 *931.494 MeV=6*931.494=5588.964 MeV, plus 0.042*931.494=40.5037 MeV. So total 5588.964 +40.5037=5629.4677 MeV=5.6294677 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.6294677 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6294677.

Compute 3 *5.6294677=16.8884031.

0.57142857 *5.6294677.

0.5 *5.6294677=2.81473385.

0.07142857 *5.6294677≈0.402053.

So 2.81473385 +0.402053≈3.21678685.

Adding to 16.8884031: 16.8884031 +3.21678685≈20.10518995 GeV.

So about 20.105 GeV, which is close to option C:20.132.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses (protons and neutrons), which would give this value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass without subtracting the electrons.

Wait, if I use the atomic mass of 6Li as 6.01512 u, and don't subtract the electrons, then m0c^2=6.01512 *931.494 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.01512 *931.494≈14.0711 MeV.

Total m0c^2=5603.035 MeV=5.603035 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.603035 GeV.

3 *5.603035=16.809105.

0.57142857 *5.603035.

0.5 *5.603035=2.8015175.

0.07142857 *5.603035≈0.401729.

So 2.8015175 +0.401729≈3.2032465.

Total E=16.809105 +3.2032465=20.0123515 GeV.

Still, that's about 20.012 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132) but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus is moving at 0.96c and thus uses the relativistic mass formula, but perhaps I'm supposed to compute it as:

E = gamma * m0 c².

But I think I've been doing that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c, so beta=0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28 =3.571428571428571.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the product more accurately.

E =3.5714285714 *5.601518315 GeV.

Compute as:

5.601518315 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

Breaking it down:

5.601518315 *3 =16.804554945.

5.601518315 *0.5714285714.

Compute 5.601518315 *0.5 =2.8007591575.

5.601518315 *0.0714285714.

0.0714285714 is 1/14.

So 5.601518315 /14 =0.400108451.

So 5.601518315 *0.0714285714 ≈0.400108451.

So adding 2.8007591575 +0.400108451 =3.2008676085.

So total E=16.804554945 +3.2008676085 =20.00542255 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0054 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed or the mass. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is not 6Li but something else. Wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So that's 6Li, as I've been using. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mass is given as 6.015 u, not subtracting the electrons. Let's see:

m0c^2=6.015 u *931.494 MeV/u=6.015 *931.494.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.015 *931.494=13.97241 MeV.

Total:5588.964 +13.97241=5602.93641 MeV=5.60293641 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.60293641= let's compute.

3 *5.60293641=16.80880923.

0.57142857 *5.60293641.

0.5 *5.60293641=2.801468205.

0.07142857 *5.60293641≈0.400775.

So 2.801468205 +0.400775=3.202243205.

Total E=16.80880923 +3.202243205=20.0110524 GeV.

Still about 20.011 GeV.

Hmm, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. Perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. But no, the question asks for the total energy.

Wait, wait a minute. Another possibility: perhaps the mass is taken as the atomic mass, including electrons. But that would be incorrect because the nucleus is charged and loses the electrons. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of a single neutron or proton, but no, the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed isn't 0.96c but a different value, but the question states that speed is 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the gamma calculation.

Wait, beta is v/c =0.96. So beta squared is 0.96^2=0.9216.

So 1 - beta^2=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the options are rounded, and the precise calculation gives about 20.005 GeV, which is closest to option C:20.132 GeV. But that's 0.127 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check once again.

Wait, perhaps the mass is 6.01512 u, which includes the electrons. But that would be incorrect because the nucleus is a bare nucleus, so the electrons are not part of it. So the correct mass should be 6.013477 u.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the exact values without any approximation.

Compute E = gamma* m0c^2.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

m0c^2 is 6.01347703 u *931.494061 MeV/u.

Let me compute 6.01347703 *931.494061.

Using a calculator approach:

6 *931.494061 =5588.964366.

0.01347703 *931.494061.

Compute as:

0.01 *931.494061=9.31494061.

0.00347703 *931.494061.

Compute 0.003*931.494061=2.79448218.

0.00047703 *931.494061=0.44452662.

Adding:2.79448218 +0.44452662=3.2390088.

So 0.00347703 *931.494061=3.2390088.

So 0.01347703 *931.494061=9.31494061 +3.2390088=12.55394941 MeV.

So m0c^2=5588.964366 +12.55394941=5601.518315 MeV=5.601518315 GeV.

E=3.5714285714 *5.601518315 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

5.601518315 *3.5714285714.

We can write 3.5714285714 as 25/7, since 25/7=3.571428...

So 5.601518315 * (25/7) = (5.601518315 *25)/7.

5.601518315 *25 =140.037957875.

Divide by7: 140.037957875 /7 =20.00542255 GeV.

So E=20.00542255 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, none is exactly 20.005 GeV. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, but that's higher. Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C, considering a slight miscalculation or rounding in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest energy as m0*c², but considering that the nucleus is moving, perhaps I should calculate kinetic energy instead of total energy. But the question asks for the energy, which typically refers to the total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, no, the question says 'energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c'. So the energy would be the total energy, gamma*m0*c².

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:20.132 GeV, but I'm not exactly sure why my calculation doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact mass of 6Li. Let me look it up. Upon checking, the exact atomic mass of ⁶Li is approximately 6.01512277 u. So the nucleus mass is 6.01512277 u minus 3 electrons (each ~0.00054858 u). That gives 6.01512277 - 0.00164574=6.01347703 u.

So I think my approach is correct. Maybe the problem expects me to round to four decimal places, but 20.005 GeV would be approximately 20.005 GeV, which isn't an option. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.127 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck all calculations for any possible mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the nucleus as 6 * (mass of a proton), which is 6 *1.007276 u=6.043656 u.

Then m0c²=6.043656 u *931.494 MeV/u=6.043656 *931.494 ≈5629.627 MeV=5.629627 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.629627 GeV.

Compute this: 3.57142857 *5.629627.

5.629627 *3 =16.888881.

5.629627 *0.57142857.

0.5 *5.629627=2.8148135.

0.07142857 *5.629627 ≈0.402053.

So 2.8148135 +0.402053≈3.2168665.

Adding to 16.888881 gives 20.1057475 GeV.

Which is about 20.106 GeV, very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, not considering binding energy, leading to this result.

Given that, the correct answer would be option C:20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (defined as \( ^6\text{Li} \)) is \( 0.96c \), we calculate the total relativistic energy \( E \) using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass \( m_0 \)
The nucleus \( ^6\text{Li} \) has an atomic mass of \( 6.01512277 \, \text{u} \). Each electron has a mass of \( 0.00054858 \, \text{u} \), and since \( ^6\text{Li} \) has 3 electrons, the mass of the nucleus is:
\[
m_0 = 6.01512277 \, \text{u} - 3 \times 0.00054858 \, \text{u} = 6.01347703 \, \text{u}
\]

### Step 3: Convert \( m_0 \) to energy
Using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest energy is:
\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.01347703 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} = 5601.518 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6015 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total energy \( E \)
The total energy is:
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6015 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:
\[
3.5714 \times 5.6015 = 3.5714 \times (5 + 0.6015) = (3.5714 \times 5) + (3.5714 \times 0.6015)
\]
\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6015 \approx 2.148
\]
\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.148 = 20.005 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.005 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

The discrepancy between the calculated value (\( 20.005 \, \text{GeV} \)) and option \( C \) (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)) may arise from rounding differences or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**.

**Answer: C**
