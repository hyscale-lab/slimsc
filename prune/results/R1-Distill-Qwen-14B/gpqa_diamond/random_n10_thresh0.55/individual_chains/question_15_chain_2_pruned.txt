Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already found these planets using the radial velocity method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. That probably means Planet_1 is closer to its star since orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law.

The stars are interesting. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because normally, a more massive star might be larger unless it's evolved. Oh, the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. So Planet_2's star is more evolved but has the same radius as the other. Hmm, but for transit probability, the star's size matters because a larger star makes the transit less likely (smaller dip in brightness). But in this case, their radii are the same, so maybe that part evens out.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But I think the probability also depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the distance of the planet from the star.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since Earth-like planets have much smaller radii than stars, R_planet is negligible. So the probability is roughly R_star / a_planet. But wait, actually, I think the formula is more about the impact parameter and the alignment. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sin i)), but if the orbits are randomly oriented, the probability is R*/a. Wait, I might be getting this mixed up.

Actually, I think the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star,
