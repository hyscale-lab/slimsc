Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down what's happening in each step of the reaction.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product 1. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. Since KOH is in excess, probably deprotonation occurs, leading to the formation of an epoxide? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide, but the positions are 1 and 3. Are they adjacent? No, because in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, so 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Wait, no, the structure of adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings, so the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons of a diamond structure. Hmm, actually, in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others, so 1 and 3 positions are two carbons apart, not adjacent. So, when heated with KOH, which is a strong base, perhaps the reaction is elimination. But wait, in dibromides, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane,
