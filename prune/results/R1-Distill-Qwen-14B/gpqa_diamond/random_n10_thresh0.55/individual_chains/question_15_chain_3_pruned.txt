Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so that the researchers should observe that one. Let me start by recalling what I know about transit probability.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star. A larger planet or a smaller star increases the chance of a transit because the planet is more likely to block our view of the star from Earth. But wait, there are other factors too, like the alignment of the orbital plane relative to our line of sight.

The question says both planets have the same minimum mass, and both have circular orbits. So their actual masses are the same (since RV method gives minimum mass, but since the orbits are circular, I think the true mass is the minimum mass). Also, both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their periods and masses.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 is 3 days, P2 is 9 days? Or maybe P1 is shorter in general. Wait, the exact numbers don't matter, just the ratio.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Since they have the same radius, Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger. How does that affect transit probability? Hmm.

Transit probability formula, as I remember, is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 times some geometric factor. The geometric probability is (R_planet + R_star) divided by the distance, but wait, maybe more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (sqrt(a^2 + (R_s + R_p)^2)) )) something... Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more clearly.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by ( (a / (a sqrt(1 - e²) )) ) or something else? No, wait, for a circular orbit (e=0), the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (1 + (a/(R_s)) )) ? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the transit probability isn't just (R_p / R_s)^2. Because even if the planet is large relative to the star, you have to be edge-on. The probability depends on the alignment. For a circular orbit, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a/(R_s * (1 - e^2)) )^{1/2}... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula.

The formula for transit probability is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (a/R_s)) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another approach is to think of the probability as the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size, squared, multiplied by the probability of the orbit being aligned correctly.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R_p / R_s)^2 / (1 + (a/R_s)) ), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a)). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense
