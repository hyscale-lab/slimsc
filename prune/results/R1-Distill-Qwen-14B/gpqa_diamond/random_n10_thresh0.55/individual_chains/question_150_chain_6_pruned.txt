Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me.

The question involves identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then figuring out what it becomes after a series of reactions. The reactions are: first, treatment with NaNO2 and HCl; second, H2O; and third, aqueous KOH with heat. The options are four different aldehydes or related compounds.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Hmm, that adds up. Carbon 8, hydrogen 9, nitrogen 1, oxygen 1. Wait, the molecular formula could be indicating a structure with a ring or maybe an aromatic group since the NMR shows peaks around 6.5-6.9, which sounds like aromatic protons.

Now, the NMR data. Let's parse it:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet with two protons. Could be part of a substituted benzene ring. Maybe para-substituted?
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. Maybe another part of the aromatic ring, perhaps an ortho or para substitution.
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, two protons. Broad suggests maybe some exchange or being in a conjugated system. Like maybe vinyl protons or something near an electronegative group.
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, two protons. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative group. Could be a CH2 next to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Wait, putting this together. The triplet at 9.72 is probably the aldehyde (CHO) group. Then, the aromatic protons: two doubletsâ€”maybe two para-substituted phenyl groups. But wait, how? Let me think.

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So if we have two phenyl groups (each is C6H5), but that would be C12H10,
