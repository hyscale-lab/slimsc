Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest and found they're the same. Then, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. The problem states that the stars radiate as black bodies, and we need to find by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same because T is inversely proportional to λ_max.

But wait, let me think again. If both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T.

So if T1 = T2, then the luminosity ratio would depend only on R squared, since L is proportional to R² T⁴ and T is same.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, wait, radial velocity—so the Doppler effect. Because when a star moves towards us or away, its emission lines shift. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that would affect its observed wavelength.

Wait, but the peak wavelengths were determined through spectroscopy. So when the star is moving, the observed wavelength changes. So the star's actual emission peak is shifted due to velocity.

Oh, right! So the observed wavelength λ_observed is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by the Doppler formula. So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, actually the Doppler shift formula is a bit more precise. It's usually approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c) when v is much smaller than c. But I'm not sure about the exact formula here.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed λ where they appear brightest are the same. So for both stars, their observed λ_max is the same. But their actual (rest frame) λ_max would be different if their velocities are different. Because the observed λ_max is λ_rest multiplied by (1 + v_r/c), assuming they are moving away. If v_r is positive, moving away, redshifted. If negative, moving towards, blueshifted.

Wait, but in our case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. Assuming that's a positive value, meaning it's moving away. So its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c). But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

Wait, but Star_1's λ_max is λ1_rest. Because its velocity is zero. So λ1_rest = λ1_obs. And Star_2's λ2_rest is λ2_obs / (1 + v_r2 / c).

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, then λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But λ is inversely proportional to T, so λ_rest = b / T. So T = b / λ_rest.

So, T1 = b / λ1_rest and T2 = b / λ2_rest. Therefore, T1 = T2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).

Wait, no. Let me think again. From the earlier equation, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c). So λ1_rest / λ2_rest = (1 + v_r2 / c).

But T1 = b / λ1_rest and T2 = b / λ2_rest.

So T1 = (b) / (λ2_rest (1 + v_r2/c )) )

Which means T1 = (b / λ2_rest ) * 1/(1 + v_r2/c )

But T2 = b / λ2_rest. So T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + v_r2/c )).

Alternatively, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, but radial velocity can't be more than the speed of light, but in this case, 700 km/s is much less than c, so we can approximate using the approximation (1 + v/c) ≈ 1 + v/c, without worrying about relativistic effects.

So, v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute v_r2 / c. Let's see, the speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is about 0.002333.

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333) approximately, using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x.

But wait, let's compute it precisely. 700 divided by 3e5 is 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... So 1 + (700/3e5) = 1.002333...

So 1/(1.002333) is approximately 0.997667.

So T1 is about 0.997667 times T2, so T1 ≈ 0.997667 T2.

Wait, but that's a small difference. So the temperatures are almost the same, but slightly lower for Star_1 than Star_2.

Wait, but wait the temperature of Star_1 is T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ), since Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ is longer (redshifted), implying that its rest λ is shorter. So Star_2's actual λ is shorter than what's observed, meaning its T is higher? Because λ is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me re-express the relation.

From the Doppler effect, when a source moves away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), assuming v_r is positive for moving away.

In our case, Star_2 is moving away with v_r =700 km/s, so its λ_obs is increased. But Star_1 has v_r=0, so λ1_obs = λ1_rest.

Given that the observed λ's for both stars are the same, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which implies λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.002333.

But λ is inversely proportional to T, so λ1_rest / λ2_rest = T2 / T1.

Because λ_rest = b / T.

So, (λ1_rest)/(λ2_rest ) = (b / T1) / (b / T2 ) ) = T2 / T1.

So,

T2 / T1 = 1.002333

Which means T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

So T1 is about 0.997667 times T2.

So the temperature of Star_1 is slightly lower than that of Star_2.

So now, let's compute the luminosities.

L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So the ratio L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴ ) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Therefore,

(R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute that. 0.997667^4.

First, compute ln(0.997667) ≈ -0.002339. Multiply by 4: -0.009356.

Exponentiate: e^-0.009356 ≈ 0.9907.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Wait, but wait, 2.25 * 0.9907 is:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275. 2.25 * 0.0007 is about 0.001575. So total approx 2.229.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

0.997667^4: Let's compute 0.997667 squared first.

0.997667^2 = (1 - 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995339.

Then square that again: (0.995339)^2 ≈ (1 - 0.004661)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004661 + (0.004661)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009322 + 0.0000217 ≈ 0.990699.

So (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2288.

Wait, but let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907 more accurately.

2.25 * 0.9907 = ?

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So adding them: 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is close. Option A is 2.25, B is 2.32, C is 2.35, D is 2.23.

So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Did I compute everything correctly? Let me check.

Wait, we have R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So (R1/R2)^2 is 2.25.

T1 = T2 * 0.997667.

So (T1/T2) is 0.997667, and (T1/T2)^4 is approximately 0.9907.

So the product is 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2288.

So the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.2288, which is about 2.23. So option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but is there another factor I'm missing? The problem states that radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. But do these velocities affect the temperature?

Wait, another approach. The observed wavelength is the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is same. So the observed λ_max = λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/3e5 )

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333 * λ2_rest.

But from Wien's law, λ_rest is proportional to 1/T. So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * 1.002333.

Which implies T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

So, yes, same as before.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( (0.997667 T2 )^4 / T2^4 )

Which is 2.25 * (0.997667)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.2288.

So the answer is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(L\) is luminosity, \(R\) is radius, \(T\) is temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the radii
The problem states that \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Squaring this gives:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Relating the temperatures
The stars are observed to have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)). Using Wien's Law (\(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\)), the observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler effect:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

For Star_1 (\(v_r = 0\)), \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}\). For Star_2 (\(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)), \(\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{700}{300,000}\right)\). Since \(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\), we have:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{700}{300,000}\right)
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333\), we get:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot 1.002333
\]

Using \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto \frac{1}{T}\), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.997667
\]

Thus, \(T_1 \approx 0.997667 T_2\).

### Step 3: Calculating the luminosity ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

We already know \(\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = 2.25\) and \(\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 0.997667\). Calculating \((0.997667)^4\):

\[
(0.997667)^4 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.2288
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The closest option to \(2.2288\) is \(2.23\), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
