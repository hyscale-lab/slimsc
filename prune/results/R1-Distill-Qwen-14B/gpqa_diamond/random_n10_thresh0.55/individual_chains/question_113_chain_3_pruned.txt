Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break down each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, which suggests the compound has either an alcohol group or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a very broad peak might be more indicative of an -OH group in a carboxylic acid because they tend to have broader and stronger absorption around that region. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but sometimes alcohols have a broad peak too. Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might correspond to another carbonyl, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group, or perhaps an aromatic ring with some substituent. Hmm, conjugated carbonyls can lower the wavenumber a bit, so maybe that's why it's at 1650.

Next, the ¹H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically in the range of δ 4.5-7. That indicates the presence of a double bond, maybe in an alkene group. So the compound has a double bond. Also, the presence of multiple peaks suggests more than one set of protons, perhaps in different environments around the molecule.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what fragments have a mass of 45. Common fragments include the methyl group (15), but 45 is more like something else. Wait, 45 is the mass of CH3CHO (which is 32? No, wait, CH3CHO is 44... Hmm, maybe it's a different group. Let me think. Another possibility is the acetylation fragment. Oh, wait, 45 could correspond to a CH2CO group. Or perhaps it's a ketene ion? Or maybe it's a fragment from an ester. Alternatively, if the molecular ion is breaking into smaller parts, maybe the 45 comes from a specific functional group.

Now, looking at the options:

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, possible functional groups. Let's consider the possibilities from the IR.

The broad peak suggests either O-H (like alcohol or carboxylic acid) or maybe an amide, but since the options don't have N, probably not. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, so maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But the 1650 might be another carbonyl, but maybe it's conjugated. Alternatively, it might not be a carbonyl. Wait, 1650 is in the range of conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, it could be an amide or an imine, but again, no N in the options, so probably not.

So, considering the two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650. Hmm,
