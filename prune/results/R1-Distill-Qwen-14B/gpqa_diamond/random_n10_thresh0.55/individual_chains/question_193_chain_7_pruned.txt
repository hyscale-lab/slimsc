Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, parallax and distance are related, right? I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula I recall is plx = 1 / distance, or plx (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is distance (d) = 1 / plx. So plx is 1/d. Because parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the distance is in parsecs. So yeah, d = 1/plx.

Now, the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx from the distance formula. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. Oh wait, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think they're asking about the differential change, like the number per unit distance. Or maybe the number in a shell of radius r to r+dr.

Wait, perhaps it
