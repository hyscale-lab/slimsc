Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let's try to think it through. Hmm, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and we need to find the ratio of the flux in two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun, right? The pp-I, II, and III branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain. I think pp-III involves a reaction where a proton captures a helium-3 ion, producing a helium-4 ion and two protons. This is a key step in the overall fusion process that produces energy.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the other reactions continue as normal. But wait, the pp-III branch is a major source of energy in the Sun, especially in the core. If it stops, the energy production in that part of the core would cease. But neutrinos are produced in various steps of this process.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly through the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the CNO cycle as well. Wait, no, wait. The main neutrino sources are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-III branch. Let me think: in the pp-III branch, a helium-3 ion captures a proton to form a carbon-12 nucleus, releasing a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, actually, the neutrino emission comes from the beta-plus decay of boron-8, which is part of the pp-III branch.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of boron-8 would stop, which in turn stops the emission of neutrinos via the beta decay of boron-8. But wait, are there other sources of neutrinos? Like, the CNO cycle also produces neutrinos, but I think they're a smaller contribution. Or maybe in the Sun, most neutrinos come from the pp-III branch.

Wait, the question says that all other reactions remained as they were. So, the CNO cycle continues, and any other neutrino production
