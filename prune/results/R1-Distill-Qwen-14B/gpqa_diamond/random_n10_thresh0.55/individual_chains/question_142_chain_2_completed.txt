Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Right, density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, using the Bloch sphere representation. But wait, this is a density matrix, so maybe it's a mixed state?

Density matrices have some properties. They should be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have a trace of 1. Let me check: ρ is a sum of projectors |0> and |1>, each multiplied by 1/2. So each term is Hermitian, and their sum is also Hermitian. The trace would be (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1. Positive semi-definite? Since |0> and |1> are orthogonal and their projectors are being added with equal weights, the eigenvalues are 1/2 each. So yes, it's a valid density matrix.

Now, what does this density matrix represent? If I have ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, that's like a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Because it's a completely mixed state for a qubit, it should correspond to the maximally mixed state.

Wait, the maximally mixed state for a qubit is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. Because I is 2x2, so I/2 would have 1/2 on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Oh wait, that's exactly what this ρ is. So ρ is the maximally mixed state.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the pure states |0> and |1> are at the poles of the sphere. The maximally mixed state would be at the center of the sphere, which is the origin (0,0,0). Because the Bloch vector for a mixed state is given by <r>, where r is (x,y,z). For maximally mixed, all components are zero.

So the point r would be (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that's the correct choice.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). This is the maximally mixed state for a qubit, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. In the Bloch sphere representation, the maximally mixed state is located at the origin, with coordinates \((0,0,0)\).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** This does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|1\rangle\), not the mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0):** This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1):** This does not correspond to any valid qubit state.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \((0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
