Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the density matrix given, ρ, and determining its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states.

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think this might be a mixed state because it's a combination of two different projectors. Wait, |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors for the states |0> and |1> respectively. So when you take their average with equal weights (1/2), it looks like a classical mixture of the two states. That makes sense because a density matrix for a mixed state is a statistical mixture.

Now, I'm trying to recall how density matrices relate to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states. Pure states correspond to points on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix of a pure state can be written as |ψ><ψ|, and for a mixed state, it's a convex combination of such projectors.

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write this in terms of the Bloch sphere coordinates. The general form of a density matrix in the Bloch sphere is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). The vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, so if I have ρ expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, then I can compare terms. Let's compute |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of the Pauli matrices.

I remember that |0> is (1,0) in the computational basis, and |1> is (0,1). The projectors are:

|0><0| = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]
|1><1| = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]

So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So when I compute (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, it's (I)/2. So ρ = I/2.

Now, comparing this to the Bloch form. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2, then r·σ must be zero. That implies that the vector r is (0,0,0), because r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0.

So the density matrix ρ is I/2, which corresponds to the completely mixed state. The Bloch vector r for this state is all zeros because there's no direction; it's equally mixed in all directions. Therefore, the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is the point (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a statistical mixture of the projectors \(|0\rangle\langle 0|\) and \(|1\rangle\langle 1|\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubits space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a density matrix on the Bloch sphere is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this to the given density matrix, we see that 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must vanish, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Therefore, the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
