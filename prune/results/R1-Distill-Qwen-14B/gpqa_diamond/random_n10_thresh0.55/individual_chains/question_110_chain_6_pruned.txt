Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I need to understand the question. The question is about detecting stars using these two instruments. The key here is the magnitude each spectrograph can observe. The user mentioned that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, no—wait, they said brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait: the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's V magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Because lower magnitude means brighter. So brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, the V magnitude must be less than or equal to 16. Because anything brighter than 16 would be mag <=16, right? Because higher magnitude is dimmer.

So the stars that can be detected by both spectrographs must have V magnitudes that are <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). Wait, no, wait. Because if a star is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, it can be detected. So the condition is V_mag < 17. For HIRES, V_mag <16. So the star needs to satisfy both: V_mag <17 and V_mag <16. So the actual condition is V_mag <16. Because the stricter condition is 16. So any star with V_mag less than 16 would be detectable by both. But wait, wait no—because each spectrograph has its own limit. So for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO (so V_mag <=17), and brighter than 16 for HIRES (V_mag <=16). So the star's V_mag must be <=16. Because that way, it's within both's brightness limits. Wait, no—because if a star is, say, 15 mag, which is brighter than 16. So it's detectable by both. But a star at 16.5 mag would be too dim for
