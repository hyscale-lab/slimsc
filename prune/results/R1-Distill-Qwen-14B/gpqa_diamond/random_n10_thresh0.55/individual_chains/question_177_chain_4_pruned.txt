Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting that both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. Hmm, but I don't know if mass affects luminosity here. Wait, the question says they're considering the stars as black bodies, so maybe the luminosity depends on radius and temperature? Because for black bodies, luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, that's the formula. So L depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

The problem states that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but then both stars have the same temperature? So their temperatures are equal. So when calculating luminosity, since L is proportional to R² T⁴, but T is the same for both, then L should be proportional to R². Because T is same, so T⁴ is same, so L is proportional to R².

So Star_1
