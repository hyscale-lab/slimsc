Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I need to figure out the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Let me think. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because for spin-½ systems, the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2 give the components of the spin operator.

Wait, the operator in question here is actually the momentum operator? Wait no, because the question says it's for a muon. But maybe that's a red herring. The problem is about finding an eigenvector of some operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator is given as the vector P, which probably is the spin component along direction n. Because the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z are similar in structure. So perhaps the operator P is the spin operator.

So, the operator P is given as a vector operator, with components Px, Py, Pz. Each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a Pauli matrix. So Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the sigma_x matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) sigma_y, and Pz is (ħ/2) sigma_z.

So the operator P in the direction n is given by the vector (P_x, P_y, P_z) dotted with the direction vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, n is usually (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, so sinφ is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, wait. Normally, in the x-y plane, phi is the azimuthal angle, but if n is in the x-z plane, that would mean phi is 0, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Or is it (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of angles. Let's say the direction vector n makes
