Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. So they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the angle at which an object appears to move when viewed from two different points. So when you're looking at stars, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Because as you move your observation point (like from Earth to some other point in space), a closer star would shift more in position compared to a distant one.

Wait, right, the formula connects distance and parallax. The distance r is inversely proportional to the parallax p. So r = 1/p. Or, more accurately, r is proportional to 1/p. Because if p is bigger (closer star), r is smaller, which lines up.

So the number of stars N varies as 1/p^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(p)^5. But since p is 1/r, substituting that in would change the expression.

Let me make it precise. If I have N ∝ 1/p^5, and p = 1/r, then substitute p:

N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 = (r^5) / 1 → N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. Oh, no, wait. Because N is proportional to 1/p^5, which is r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5?

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. So it's the number of stars per unit distance. So maybe I need to think about the differential, like dN/dr.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number density. But let me think.

If N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a region at distance r would be proportional to r^5. But how does that change as r increases, per unit r?

Wait, but the problem says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe I'm confusing luminosity distance and the number of stars. Let's think again.

Wait, parallax p is related to distance by r (in parse
