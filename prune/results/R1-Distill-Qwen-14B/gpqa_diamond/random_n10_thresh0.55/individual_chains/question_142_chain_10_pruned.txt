Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but mixed states are combinations of these.

So the given ρ is a mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal weight since it's multiplied by 1/2. That tells me it's a classical mixture of two orthogonal states. I think this kind of state is called a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because in a two-level system, the maximally mixed state should have equal probabilities for both states, right?

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. I remember that for single qubit states, the Bloch sphere is used to represent them. The Bloch vector (or sometimes called the purity vector) r has components (x, y, z), and it's parameterized such that any density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let's get that formula straight. The general form for a single qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. And the Bloch vector r is (r_x, r_y, r_z). So for a pure state |ψ> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>, the Bloch vector would point in the direction (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But for a mixed state, especially a maximally mixed one, I think r might be zero.

Wait, so in the case of the maximally mixed state, which is ρ = I/2, because I is the identity matrix. Let me write out what the given ρ is. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is the same as I/2. Because |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 on (2,2). Adding them gives the identity matrix, so ρ is (I)/2.

So if I compare this to the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's set them equal: (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. So each component (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) must equal zero. The only way this is true is if all r components are zero. So r = (0, 0, 0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer is C.

Wait, another way to think about it: The maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin. So the vector r would be zero. That aligns with
