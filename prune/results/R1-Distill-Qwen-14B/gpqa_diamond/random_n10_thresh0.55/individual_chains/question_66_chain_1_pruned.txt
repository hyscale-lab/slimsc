Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are organized by their dimension, starting with dimension 6. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's supposed to respect certain symmetries of the underlying theory, which is presumably the Standard Model plus some new physics at a higher scale.

So the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all the operators in SMEFT. Let's think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that in the Standard Model, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. All the terms in the SM Lagrangian are Lorentz-invariant. So any effective theory derived from the SM should also respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT operators must be Lorentz-invariant. That means Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely one that's respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require Poincare? Well, the SMEFT is a field theory, so it's supposed to be a Lorentz-invariant theory, but what about Poincare? The Poincare group includes the Lorentz group and translations. But in effective theories, sometimes you consider them in a particular frame, like the rest frame. Wait, but all the terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian are local, so they should respect translation invariance. Because if you add a term that's not translation invariant, like a term depending on the position (as in a background field), then it's not part of the dynamical fields.

Wait, but the effective theory is constructed by integrating out heavy fields, so the resulting operators should still be local and translation invariant. So Poincare symmetry would require that the operators are invariant under Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is a local field theory, all the operators should be Poincare-invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because I've
