Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out what the major products are for each and match them with the options given.

Let me start with part A. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

Wait, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, in this case, one compound is acting as the nucleophile (the enolate) and the other as the electrophilic partner.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. It's a diester, so when deprotonated, it becomes a strong nucleophile. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That's an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which should be the Michael acceptor.

So the reaction would involve the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacking the beta position of the acrylate. The structure of the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait: the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl group on C3. So it's CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-COOCH3? Or maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong. The formula would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the substituent on the beta carbon, which is the C3? Hmm, maybe it's more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(C6H4-4Me)=O? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2CH3? No, not sure. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-R, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be a substitution on the CH2 part. Hmm, perhaps (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, but that would be more like CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)COOCH3, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate could be CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, perhaps it's
