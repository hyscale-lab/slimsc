Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the molecular formula given: C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. I'm thinking maybe an aromatic compound since we have a benzene ring involved. The NMR data will probably help figure out the structure.

Looking at the 1H-NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm as a triplet, integrating to 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehyde protons usually show up around 9-10 ppm. A triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an enal (a conjugated aldehyde and double bond).

- 6.98 ppm as a doublet (2H). The downfield shift here makes me think of aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. If it's a doublet, perhaps it's part of a di-substituted ring where the coupling is with two equivalent protons, like in a para-substituted benzene.

- 6.51 ppm as another doublet (2H). This is also in the aromatic region. If the first set was 6.98 (d, 2H), and this is 6.51 (d, 2H), maybe they are two sets of para-substituted protons on two different rings. Wait, but wait—could it be something else, like a di-substituted aromatic ring with coupling?

- 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet (2H). Broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton. But wait, the integration is 2H. Oh, maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring where the protons are equivalent and not split because of symmetry or maybe coupling with each other but appearing as a singlet? Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde with some adjacent protons, but not sure.

- 3.66 ppm as a doublet (2H). This is in the range for CH2 groups, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. If it's a doublet, perhaps it's next to another CH2 group or a neighboring proton. Like maybe a CH2 connected to something electronegative, like oxygen. For example, an ether or an ester group.

Putting this together: the molecule has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 triplet), some aromatic rings (the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets could be two benzene rings, each with two protons coupled as doublets), and maybe a CH2 group attached to oxygen (the 3.66 ppm doublet). The broad singlet at 6.27 for 2H—could that be a conjugated diene, or maybe an aromatic ring with two protons in a para position but something else going on?

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 could be an enol proton. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring where the protons are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, making them deshielded. But the
