Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The question is asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the actual operator for the direction n would be P · n, which is Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz * n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n would be zero, so P_y doesn't contribute. That might simplify things.

So the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, which means n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Maybe I can represent n in terms of an angle θ. Like, n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, or something like that? Wait, wait, the usual convention is that θ is the angle from the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the angle φ (azimuthal) would be 0 or maybe 180 degrees, but since it's arbitrary, perhaps I can represent it using θ
