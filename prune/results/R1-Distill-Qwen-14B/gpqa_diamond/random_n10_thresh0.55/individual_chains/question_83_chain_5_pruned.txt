Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they should form acetate ions and water.

Let me read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 mL. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we need to pick the correct one.

First, I should find out the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial moles of acetic acid would be volume times molarity. Volume is 20 mL, which is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles divided by volume, 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, the titration with NaOH. Let's think about what happens at 25% titration and at equivalence.

At 25% titration: That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 times the moles of acetic acid present.

Wait, the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.001, right? So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles of NaOH. But wait, the NaOH is 0.1 M, so to find the volume needed to reach 25% titration, perhaps it's better to compute the volume. Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of moles reacting.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the concentration of the species at 25
