Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. Oh wait, so both are moving in the same direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the speed limit c. So you can't just do 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. That would be the classical approach, but relativity has a different formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, right. So v1 is the speed of the first astronaut relative to the second's frame? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, no, wait. Let me get that straight. If the astronauts are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be from the perspective of one astronaut looking at the other. So which one's frame are we considering?

Wait, I think the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed
