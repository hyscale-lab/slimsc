Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Let me start by reading the problem again.

So, the question says there are two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. The energy difference between these levels is 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), and we need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote the excited state as level i and the lower state as level j. So, the ratio of populations would be n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -delta E/(k*T) ).

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, so n1_i / n1_j = 2. Similarly, for star_2, n2_i / n2_j = let's say x, but wait, the problem doesn't say star_2's ratio, but star_1 is twice star_2. Wait, no, the problem says star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So I think that implies that (n_i / n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j).

Wait, or maybe it's that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2 for the same energy level? Hmm. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation is twice. So that would mean n1_i is twice n2_i? Or is the excitation per atom?

Wait, maybe the ratio is n1_i / n_j (for that level) is twice that of n2_i / n_j. So let me think. The Boltzmann factor would give each star's ratio.

So for star 1: n1_i / n1_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -delta E/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: n2_i /n2_j = same (g_i/g_j) exp( -delta E/(k T2) )

But the problem says, star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's. So:

n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j )

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions,

(g_i/g_j) exp( -delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * (g_i/g_j exp( -delta E/(k T2) ) )

Ah, since (
