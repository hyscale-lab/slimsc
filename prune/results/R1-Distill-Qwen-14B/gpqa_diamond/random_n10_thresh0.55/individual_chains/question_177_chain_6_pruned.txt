Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I need to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by listing the given information. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, M1 = 1.5 * M2. But wait, does mass matter here? The question is about luminosity, which for stars, I think is more related to radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. Luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power, right? So L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

Wait, but if their temperatures are the same, then the luminosity ratio would depend on the radius squared. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 =1.5 R2, R1/R2 =1.5. So then, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25, but wait, the options are a bit close. Hmm, but wait, there's more to the problem.

Wait, the radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect the problem? Oh,
