Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to move a bit. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both orbits are circular. So, same star masses, same planet masses. Interesting.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, the RV method detects the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

The formula I think is K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) )

But since the planets have similar mass to Neptune and stars are like the Sun, M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular, so the denominator simplifies to just P.

Wait, maybe the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (1) / (P * (1/(1 + M_p/M_* ))^(1/3) )) )

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a simplified version. Oh right, when M_p is much less than M_*, the formula approximates to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 + (M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to approximately K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P) )^(1/3) ). Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up terms.

Alternatively
