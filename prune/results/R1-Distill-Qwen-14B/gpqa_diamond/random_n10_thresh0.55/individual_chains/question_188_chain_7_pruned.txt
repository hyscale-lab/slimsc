Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, let me think. I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral. I think rhombohedral means that the lattice is a special case of both cubic and hexagonal systems, but in this case, it's more like a general rhombohedral or maybe a trigonal system. Oh right, rhombohedral has all edges equal and all angles equal, which is exactly what the question states: alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstrom, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a' since in a rhombohedral system, each edge is the same length. So a = 10 A.

The plane is (111), so the Miller indices are h=1, k=1, l=1.

I remember the formula for interplanar spacing d_hkl is given by 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2(hk cos α + kl cos β + lh cos γ))/(a²), but wait, is that right? Or is it a different formula?

Alternatively, I think the formula might be d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + kl cos α + lh cos β) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure about the signs and the angles. Or is it that all the angles are used in the cross terms?

Wait, no, I think in rhombohedral systems, the formula for d-spacing uses the angles between the lattice vectors. Since all angles are the same here (gamma = alpha = beta = 30°), that might simplify things.

Let me try to write the formula correctly. The general formula is:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ]

Wait, no, wait, that might not be correct. Because in a rhombohedral system, each pair of vectors has the same angle alpha. So in the general formula for interplanar distance, which for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral crystal is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) * (1 - (cos α)^2) ) + (something with hk,
