Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that Li is lithium, so I think I should find out what the mass number is for Li with 3 neutrons.

Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is protons plus neutrons. Protons are 3, so 3 +3 =6. So it's Li-6? Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 6 nucleons, so it's Li-6. But wait, isn't Li-6 a stable isotope? Or is it Li-7 that's more common? Hmm, maybe I should double-check. Anyway, I think for this problem, the specific isotope isn't the main focus; it's more about the calculation.

The main point is to find the energy when the speed is 0.96c. So I think this is a relativistic mechanics problem. I remember that when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics. So I should use the relativistic equations.

The first thing I need is the energy of the nucleus. In relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So E = gamma * m0 c².

But wait, gamma depends on v, which is given as 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²)/(c²)).

Plugging in v=0.96c: v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then sqrt(0.0784) is... let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784). Well, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.2
