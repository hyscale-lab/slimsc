Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is in three dimensions, right? Because it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the operator P is a vector operator, I think. So the total operator would be something like P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Wait, no, because each component is given as a matrix. Let me think.

Wait, each P component is given as a 2x2 matrix. So for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. So the operator P in each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

But wait, the operator we're considering is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ must be 0 or π? Wait, no, actually, any direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π, but perhaps θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, x is in the direction of θ=90 degrees (π/2 radians), but in the x-z plane, the direction is determined by θ.

Wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. So n would be (n_x, 0, n_z). So the unit vector in that direction would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π/2? Wait, no, because the x-z plane has angles where φ=0 (along x) and φ=π/2 (along z). So, the direction n can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis. So, the unit vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because, for example, when θ=0, you're along z, and θ=π/2, along x.

So the operator P along n would be P · n̂, which would be (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z). But since n_y is zero, P · n̂ = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, the operator in the direction n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But let's compute this. So P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So their combination along n would be something like (n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z) multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The operator along direction n is given by:

P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But each P_x, P_y, P_z is already a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So substituting:

P_n = (n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]) )

So, P_n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ]

Wait, let me compute that. The P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by n_x (ħ/2), it's [[0, n_x (ħ/2)], [n_x (ħ/2), 0]]. Similarly, P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by n_z (ħ/2), so [[n_z (ħ/2), 0], [0, -n_z (ħ/2)]].

Adding these together:

Top left: n_z (ħ/2) + 0 = n_z (ħ/2)
Top right: n_x (ħ/2) + 0 = n_x (ħ/2)
Bottom left: n_x (ħ/2) + 0 = n_x (ħ/2)
Bottom right: 0 + (-n_z (ħ/2)) = -n_z (ħ/2)

So the matrix P_n becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z ] ]

But wait, wait. Because the first term is P_x = (ħ/2) X, so when you multiply by n_x, it's (n_x ħ/2) X. Similarly for P_z.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to write P_n as (n_x X + n_z Z) multiplied by ħ/2.

Yes, because X is the Pauli matrix for P_x, Y for P_y, etc. So yes, P_n = (n_x X + n_z Z) (ħ/2).

So the matrix is indeed (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, perhaps.

Wait, but direction in x-z plane: if the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, then n_x = sinθ cosφ. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is zero (along x) or π (along -x). But wait, because the x-z plane can have any angle φ = 0 to π/2 or something? Wait, no, the x-z plane is where y=0, so the angle φ is either 0 or π, or any multiple within that—no, wait, no. Actually, the azimuthal angle φ is measured in the x-y plane. So if the direction is purely in x-z, then the direction is given by θ (polar angle from z-axis) and φ=0 or φ=π, depending on the direction.

Wait, perhaps I should model n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the positive z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So substituting into P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Yes, because n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So the matrix becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the matrix of P_n is (ħ/2) times that.

We need to find the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so:

P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So, the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, since |v> is a column vector with components a and b.

We can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, so we have:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation simplifies to:

[ cosθ a + sinθ b ] = a
[ sinθ a - cosθ b ] = b

Which gives the two equations:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange these equations.

Equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0 → a (cosθ -1) + sinθ b = 0.

Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0 → sinθ a - b (cosθ + 1) = 0.

So, now we have a system of two equations:

a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0 → [Equation A]

sinθ a = b (cosθ + 1) → [Equation B]

Let me express a from Equation B. From Equation B: a = [b (cosθ + 1)] / sinθ.

Substitute into Equation A:

[ ( (b (cosθ+1)) / sinθ ) (cosθ -1) ) ] + b sinθ = 0.

Let me factor b:

b [ ( (cosθ+1)(cosθ -1) ) / sinθ + sinθ ] = 0.

Wait, (cosθ+1)(cosθ-1) is cos²θ -1, which is -sin²θ.

So,

b [ ( (- sin²θ ) / sinθ ) + sinθ ] = 0.

Simplify inside the brackets:

(- sin²θ / sinθ ) = - sinθ.

So,

- sinθ + sinθ = 0.

So, 0 =0.

Which means that the equations are dependent, and so we can solve for a in terms of b, or vice versa.

Let me express a in terms of b using Equation B: a = [b (cosθ +1)] / sinθ.

So, let me write the eigenvector as a column vector [a; b], where a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] * b.

Wait, but let's note that sinθ can't be zero because if θ=0, then n is along z, and P_n would be P_z, which has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So in that case, the eigenvector for +ħ/2 would be [1; 0]. But for θ not 0 or π, we can proceed.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the eigenvectors of P_n.

The matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, as expected for a spin-½ operator.

The eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would satisfy:

[ [cosθ -1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] * [a; b] = 0.

So, the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Wait, but since the matrix is 2x2, the two equations should be linearly dependent. Let's take the first equation, which is (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0.

We can write this as a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

Hmm, using the identity (1 - cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So,

a = [ (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ) ] b.

Simplify:

a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b = cot(θ/2) b.

So a = cot(θ/2) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [ cot(θ/2) b; b ].

We can factor out b:

= b [ cot(θ/2); 1 ]

To normalize, the sum of squares must be 1.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(θ/2)|² |b|² + |b|² = |b|² (cot²(θ/2) +1 ) = |b|² csc²(θ/2) ) =1.

So |b|² csc²(θ/2) )=1 → |b|= sin(θ/2).

So, b is sin(θ/2). Then a is cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ) ]^T ?

Wait, wait: Wait, because a is cot(θ/2) * b. And b is sin(θ/2), so a = cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait. If θ is measured from the z-axis, and we're in the x-z plane, then the eigenstate for spin-up along n would have components cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But wait, let me think about the standard spin states.

In the standard basis, the eigenstate of S_z is |↑> = [1; 0], |↓> = [0;1].

When the spin is along another direction, say the x-axis, the eigenstate is a superposition. For example, along x, it's (1/√2)(|↑> + |↓>), which can be written as [1,1]/√2.

Wait, but in our case, the direction is n, which is in the x-z plane. So the eigenstate would be expressed as a linear combination of |↑> and |↓>, with coefficients depending on θ.

Wait, but our calculation says the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but what if θ is 0? Let's test θ=0. Then cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. So the eigenvector would be [1,0], which is correct for the eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. That's correct.

Another test: θ=π/2. Then, cos(π/4)=√2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2. So the eigenvector would be [√2/2, √2/2], which is (1/√2)(1,1), the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue +ħ/2. That also makes sense.

Wait, but wait: when θ is 0, it's the z-direction, and the eigenvector is [1,0], correct. When θ is π, which is along -z, then cos(θ/2)=cos(π/2)=0, sin(θ/2)=sin(π/2)=1. So the eigenvector is [0,1], which would correspond to eigenvalue -ħ/2. Hmm, but the question asks for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, so θ can't be π in this case. So we're only considering θ in [0, π], but only the cases where the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so perhaps θ is between -π/2 and π/2?

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up with the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the general expression is correct, and the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without any hbar factors. Option D has sqrt terms multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but with hbar as well.

Wait, the question says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So the eigenvector components should be normalized, meaning their squares add up to 1.

Our calculation gives the components as cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). The sum of squares is cos^2(theta/2)+sin^2(theta/2)=1, so it's already normalized.

So the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches option C.

Wait, but option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So the answer should be option C.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))

Wait, but the eigenvector shouldn't have hbar factors because it's a dimensionless vector. The operator P has dimensions of ħ (since it's a spin operator), but the eigenvector is a unit vector in Hilbert space, so the components are just numbers, not involving ħ.

Looking at the options, option C is the only one without hbar factors and has the correct theta/2 terms. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is expressed as:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $\hat{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is the unit vector in the x-z plane. Substituting the given forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting the matrix and solving the eigenvalue equation, we find that the eigenvector components satisfy:

\[
a = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad b = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]

The eigenvector is thus:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as the components satisfy $\cos^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ — This does not match the derived eigenvector and includes incorrect $\hbar$ factors.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ — This is not consistent with the derived eigenvector components.
- **Option C**: $(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$ — This matches the derived eigenvector exactly and is normalized.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$ — This includes incorrect $\hbar$ factors and does not match the derived eigenvector.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
