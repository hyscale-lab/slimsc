Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin along any direction is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the direction vector. So the operator P would be something like P = n · σ * ħ/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but let me parse the given information. For each component:

- Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the general operator when you have an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, it doesn't have a y-component, so n = (a, 0, b). But since it's a unit vector, a² + b² = 1.

The operator P along n would be (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n_x and n_z are components of the unit vector. So let me write that as P = (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) * (ħ/2). Because each P component is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices, so when we take the sum, it's (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2.

Alternatively, since each component of P is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, the operator for direction n is (n · σ) * (ħ/2).

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>. Here, λ is given as +ħ/
