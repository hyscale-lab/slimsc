Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, the question is asking for the energy of the collider such that a nucleus X is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, c. And the options are four different energies. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Li usually has 3 protons, right? So Li-6 would be 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. So the mass of the nucleus is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, I think. But wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses, but in general, for heavy ions, we approximate the mass as A times the mass of a proton. So I'll proceed with that.

The formula I remember for relativistic energy is the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. The velocity given is 0.96c, so I need to find gamma for that speed.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. Let's calculate v squared over c squared. So v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that would be sqrt(0
