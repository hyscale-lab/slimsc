Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stochiometric means the molar ratio is exactly 1:1, right? So the complex is CaY²- where Y is the EDTA. And the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and in its active form, so it can form the complex properly. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything here.

They give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So at this concentration, some of it might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But wait, since Kf is so large (5e10), which is a big number, that suggests the complex is very stable. So the dissociation should be minimal, meaning the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be really low.

So the question is, what's the concentration of Ca²+ ions in the solution? The options are all in the 1e-2 to 1e-7 range, so it's a matter of figuring out which order of magnitude is correct.

Let me try to model this. The complex is at 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. Let's say some of it dissociates, with 'x' being the concentration that dissociates. So, [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4−] = x. But wait, since the complex is much more stable, x would be very small compared to 0.02, right? So maybe I can approximate [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02, since x is negligible compared to 0.02.

So the Kf equation would be: Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02/(x²)

So rearranging, x² = 0.02 / Kf.

Wait, Kf is 5e10, so plugging in: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14. So x = sqrt(4e-14) = 2e-7. So [Ca²+] is 2e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which is close but not exactly the same. Hmm, wait, maybe I made an approximation that's not valid.

Wait, because when I assumed [CaY²−] is approximately 0.02, but perhaps I should consider that some of it dissociates. Let me think again. Let me set up the equation properly.

Let me define the initial concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, the concentration of the complex at equilibrium is 0.02 - x. But if x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the approximation is valid, because Kf is so large.

So, the Kf expression becomes (0.02) / (x^2) ) =5e10.

Solving for x^2: x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-3/(5e10) = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate. 0.02 is 2e-2, right? So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x^2 = 0.4e-12 → x = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, no, sqrt(0.4) is about 0.632, so sqrt(0.4e-12) is 0.632e-6, which is 6.32e-7 M. Oh, that's about 6.3e-7, which matches option C.

Wait, so I think I messed up the exponents earlier. Let me double-check.

Kf = [CaY²−]/( [Ca²+][Y^4−] )

If [CaY²−] is 0.02 M (approximate), and [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] are both x (since stoichiometric), then Kf = (0.02) / (x²) = 5e10.

So solving for x²: x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x = sqrt(0.4e-12) → sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So option C is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought x squared was 4e-14, but that was a miscalculation. Oh wait, no, I made a mistake in the initial exponent.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. 5e10 is 5e10. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)*1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x squared is 4e-13 → x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → which is 6.32e-7. So that's correct. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, why was I confused earlier? Because I thought 0.02 /5e10 is 4e-14, but that's not correct. 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 /5e10 is 2/(5e12) → which is 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So yeah, x is sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5 → 6.3e-7 M.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and \( K_f \) is very large, the dissociation is negligible, and we approximate \([\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{0.4 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
