Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are labeled A to D.

First, I'll look at each piece of data provided.

Starting with the FTIR:

- Broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Hmm, a broad peak in IR usually suggests O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a broad peak and strong, maybe it's a hydroxyl group. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic O-H like in phenol? But those are usually less broad, though. Or perhaps it's an alcohol or something else with an O-H.

- Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might be conjugated carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group? Or maybe an amide, but I don't think so because amides usually have lower carbonyl frequencies. Wait, another possibility: maybe the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ester or something with a conjugated double bond, or maybe an alkyne? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents.

Next, the 1H NMR:

- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule has a double bond somewhere. So maybe an alkene is present.

Mass Spec:

- Fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. What fragments give m/z 45? Let's think. Maybe a CH3 group with some oxygen? Or an (O)CH2CH3? Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH3 (maybe not). Or perhaps it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+) but that's 91. Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)CO, which
