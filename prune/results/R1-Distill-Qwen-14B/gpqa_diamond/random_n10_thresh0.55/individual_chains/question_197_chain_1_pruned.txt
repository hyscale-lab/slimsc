Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided are the IR and 1H NMR spectra of Compound X.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be related to aromatic C=C stretching or possibly conjugated carbonyl groups.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is probably an alcohols proton, but wait, 10.5 is high. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, if it were an alcohol, it might be more around 1-5 ppm. Carboxylic acids are usually around 10-12 ppm. But I also have to think about exchange; sometimes these protons can be broad and may not appear if the sample is old. Hmm.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents, maybe para-substituted. The doublets suggest coupling with adjacent Hs. For example, if you have a para-substituted benzene, like with two substituents on opposite carbons, each pair of Hs would be a doublet. So this might be something like a para-disubstituted benzene.

Wait, but if there's a carbonyl group attached, like a ketone or an acid, that could change things. Let me think: if the substituent is a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet integrating to 1H. Maybe a CH group adjacent to an oxygen or another group. Like in a CH2CH(O)something.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, this time for 2H. Perhaps a CH2 group next to a carbonyl or another electronegative atom.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for 3H, which is likely a methyl group attached to something that causes splitting, like a CH adjacent to a CH2 or a branching point.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for 3H, which is a terminal methyl group, probably in a chain like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that's an ester or a ketone, along with a side chain.

Wait, the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's an ester, that would make sense because esters have a strong C=O around 1720-1740 cm-1. Alternatively, it could be a ketone, which usually is around 1700-1780, but esters are a bit higher on average. But it could vary.

So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester. Let me think about the NMR again.

The aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the substituents are attached in the para positions. So if the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions, each being an ester group, but wait, then each substituent would influence the neighboring Hs.

Wait, no. If the substituent is an ester, like OCO-R, that would cause the adjacent Hs to couple, leading to doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzene with an est
